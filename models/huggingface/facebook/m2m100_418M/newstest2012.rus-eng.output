Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine in the course of amendments to the Criminal and Procedural Code rejected the attempt to cancel the article, according to which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko was condemned.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on the relief of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was recognised as unprofitable.
The judgment is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political repentance of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to abolish Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was supported by 147 members of the Parliament.
It would require 226 votes for its ratification.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. without him the war ended.
It is time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the usual Shariah law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, as the punishment for theft is the cut of the hand.
Women may forget the emancipation; potential believers will be executed; etc.
Instead of the dictatorship, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Qur’an.
There will be a order in Libya that we can’t imagine and that we hardly wish for ourselves.
In any case, our way of life is not the only in its kind or the best, and it would probably not fit, for example, the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have taken help from the unbelievers.
Their only justification is that they believe that the NATO attacks were not led by the American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they praised after each attack.
And if in Libya to look for the winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians were free from the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to give up the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not have to worry about the expulsion of the "crossers".
Although without occupation, will the oil companies get Libya’s black gold almost for a discount?
And the West then will finally be able to get rid of the useless protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Shariah do not put this end.
A new wave of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are now at the center of the attention of investors.
A statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have published GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in stagnation, Germany and France show growth.
The debt market is now battling records.
Investors are already looking not only toward Italy; now they have focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurozone Statistical Bureau in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary assessments of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP increased by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany's affairs went better than expected (a 0.3% increase instead of the original 0.1%).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in stagnation. According to the Czech Statistical Bureau, this confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown of economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts predicted.
The key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union demonstrated a 0.2% growth compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analytics forecasts.
The Greek economy demonstrated a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The profitability of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The profitability of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium etc. are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the worsening of the situation in the region, the revenue of Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Republic has been selected in the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won by 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully dealt with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Yirachek, they won by 1-0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after the home match, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the course of the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing notable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, in part because of the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yirachek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates the end of the European Championship.
Excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Vučić became the most unsuccessful pair of matches after missing two great chances.
Great Peter Chek is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. and the Czech football thus earns about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minutes the game was very stressful.
Both teams had difficulties with making combinations; the game spent most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of the masters in the first half. The further strikes behind the defense line were carefully captured by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Hundreds of university students have created a live shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
Thus they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, following the students' prayers before entering the building, a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel followed.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a live shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
Thus they demonstrated their willingness to protect their country’s nuclear program at the price of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that it all shows that Iran has failed to attempt to get nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, following students’ prayers before the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, a prayer was followed for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the Iranian nuclear program, the targets will, according to the Israeli press, be installations both in Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Food for children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and cabbage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are more weight than normal; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families leading an unhealthy lifestyle.
We see again the importance of the environment and behavior patterns that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, cabbage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity eat for dinner free potatoes on the eve of the survey relating to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not do sports. This, however, applies to the majority of the families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said their parents find time to do sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year; it attended 900 primary class students throughout Bohemia.
This event was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and Unilever.
At the present time, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Correct nutrition and adequate sports loads are the main determining factors that cause a rapidly growing number of children suffering either from excess weight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day, according to the scheme of breakfast, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and that’s one of the indispensable conditions for proper nutrition,” one of the findings said.
No clay and clay in the evening.
Experts warn that even such relative details are important for healthy development, such as the constant time of family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast together.
Most families eat breakfast separately.
The worst discovery was that in every ten families people don’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis for the right daily diet.
Research has shown that cooked food is more common in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet cooling drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly do sports, this figure decreases more than twice - to 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In the second part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were suggested to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their own tastes and preferences.
“The food preferences in Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from the ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Their favorite food includes a large amount of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"Special concern is caused by the great popularity of sweet cooling drinks," the study says in the final part.
As the main meal, the pasta defeated the bird with a small overweight.
However, children practically showed no interest in beans, fish and vegetable dishes.
Desire for a healthy way of life
The study also showed that children are ready to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
"Many participants in the study control group demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled up the questionnaire after the conclusion of the lesson Obesity is not a coincidence," the project said.
This was noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cooling drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
Additionally, as the main dish, children were more likely to note the bird and fish, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and bakes.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, experts say.
In the first article on the training for stylists I visited on the amount of information on the introductory classes.
I didn’t know what would happen next.
Lectures of three experts in this field; advice on the selection of clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Next is more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks awaits us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really filled with information.
This time, with Alenka, the director, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One short neck, the other boy figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than the norm.
A stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
They gave us advice on how to emphasize the figure of such women as Jennifer Lopez, i.e. the owner of a more luxurious chest and bears and narrow belt, and at the same time not dress them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the belt and beard is so large that you can’t pick a jacket or pants, you should have at least one thing shed on order.
You will obviously not regret the funds invested, as perfectly sitting clothes are invaluable.
In the jacket shed on order, you’ll feel much better than in the one that is constantly swallowing, swallowing, nagging the belt, etc.
The owners of boy figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with rubbishes, appliances, scratches or clothes.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid, it's too much, taking into account the home task we got.
Each participant of the courses had to invent two dresses for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We need to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I’m going to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know from the Victoria’s Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m glad for myself because it’s much easier to wear than, let’s say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently recovered to the tone (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We must cut out clothes from magazines or find them on the internet, print and process using graphic programs.
Mudboard - so called the result of work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep the graphic component of the style in mind.
A stylist doesn’t just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, pants, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only on Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Poorny; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist must use this fact.
A good stylist can use one object of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a pants can be worn in a normal way, over the jeans and shirt like a pants; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without traps like a dress.
Another option is to hang the gloves or raise the gate, and the whole image is completely changed.
“Play with him,” he emphasized.
Anyway, I’ve most appreciated the following advice: “For your work you need to know the rules perfectly.”
Then you can start breaking them,” Jacob said to us.
Here I finally understood why we get all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist is ready to have more costume options than the number of photos he needs to make.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten sets) I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that on the picture the object of clothing often looks and works in combination with others not exactly as in reality.
We need to keep it in mind when we create an image.
Honza Poorny confirmed that often image and style are half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it excessive (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and how they look - secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (smaller) size than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids did not write anything about that some celebrity dropped/weighted, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for the stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up the order.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not encourage them and adhere to their opinion.
“If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can’t throw out all her closet, telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Have at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them,” Mario says.
He also showed us that the work bag should be contained specifically.
This is the bag you bind around the belt to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as pants, folded rolls or English folds, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when capturing certain items, for example, a bag or a hat), special clips to fix the fabric on the back if the clothes are too large (folds and similar items are prohibited as they break the clothes) or a set for shaving.
To get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to make the right footwear patches.
Even during the shooting in the studio, where the floor is smooth, the floor can get damaged - not to mention the shooting on the street.
So we took the swear.
You should not touch the shoes with footwear so that you don’t break them.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
These skills didn’t like me.
This is just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I begin to realize that being a professional stylist is not as easy as to say.
Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review
What had to be a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and negligent errors.
Ambitions to a certain extent were satisfied, but it doesn’t matter, as no one clearly wanted to do an extra job.
Before the release with the new version with the subtitle "Flying" linked great hopes.
It was expected that it would move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game will take a decent place in the race game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character comes out of the car and runs.
As it often happens with NFS, there is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty bad arcade race, but the overall impression is broken by a few unnecessary errors that are present in this series of games for several years.
And thus, in reality, this is not a mistake, but a manifestation of the unexplicable line of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You’re becoming part of a story whose protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You’re sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get first to New York.
This idea has a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes on its own route, the individual stages go in a diverse and interesting environment.
There is no feeling that the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the graph is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some trails are pleasant to watch.
However, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving the car through the desert, through the autumn suburbs or high in the snowed mountains is very pleasant.
Furthermore, the race from time to time revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandy storm that significantly decreases the visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the labyrinth.
The races are quite well arranged.
There are only a few varieties, but that is enough.
For some time you’re trying to overcome several rivals (in essence a regular race); then you’re trying to improve the time (standard race with a second meter); or you’re competing with one opponent.
On the other hand, you’re getting to the police from time to time, which makes your task even more complicated.
The components outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack escapes from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it’s surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because this property is not tired; taking into account all the above, it’s one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The race model follows the traces of the previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you’re looking for a real life imitation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far everything is very well.
However, after a while the problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game you don’t expect complicated transformations and collisions, but if you don’t have any idea before you collide with the object, how your machine will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, riding or passing through the cars in a narrow stream, you are sometimes slightly touched by another car. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation your car begins to rush.
Or suddenly broken.
This is not so important thanks to the restart system, but this is enough to break the fun.
The rebounds are arranged so that if you break down or go far from the track, the game returns you to the point where it was interrupted.
There are only five rebounds available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful if something fails, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes rebounds are not enough, and you have to learn the separate area of the race.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to pass in a certain way, otherwise you simply won’t fit.
In other cases, you meet civil cars in a specific place in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is annoying in situations when you see how your opponent easily passes between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the cars are already located so that you need either to run them or drop the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re next to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The competitors have other advantages.
During the game you will find several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent pursues you in the same place.
This is obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you’re going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand up before you despite anything.
The fact is that when he goes before you, he worsenes your view, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it’s so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
Sadly because despite the simple model of driving, the game is fun and sometimes so saturated with events that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what doesn’t miss you – a concept with fifty unique trails, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the supplies on the road because it is on them your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful U.S. cars are suitable for direct road cuts; and exotic super-sport cars are suitable for technical driving, for example, on rough mountain trails.
The main story mode is closely linked to the challenge mode; it’s races on individual areas that you’ll learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and glasses, common for challenges and story modes.
Many options are available to get a higher driving level: starting from machines and ending with profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online Autolog feature, which, among all other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here is another disadvantage that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in a sequence.
You and your car get into the metro tunnel (we'll think that's so), where you're swallowing on the rails in the dark (we'll think that's so).
Your spidometer shows figures from 150 to 200 km/h (we’ll think that’s so) when suddenly a subway train runs on your back, turning your car into a metal thumb.
For a few days, our edition discussed whether at the time of creating the game no one thought for a second, or its creators really considered us such a bull.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video game is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is unfortunate that at some critical moments the quality of recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This especially applies to accidents with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you too.
Sound is in order; soundtrack is for the lover.
In order to satisfy the wider youth audience as possible, the soundtrack's compositions of different styles came in; but it's unlikely that many people buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite uncommon.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the past few years.
Anyway, the game leaves the feeling of incomplete.
Of course, it’s a good entertainment, but be prepared for the fact that the shortcomings will blind you as a airport lighting.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation of disadvantages and skeptics towards the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant disagreements between individual organizations.”
“I didn’t expect that there would be such a brutal war.”
“It will take five or six years before the situation is somehow stabilized, calmed and all players will get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vitsenova hardly started his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She demonstrated how much she adheres to her motto "Clarely and Openly about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relations between them so simple and clear that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the Republic of Lithuania would be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent chairman of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“First, the critics said he was a ordinary gray office mouse that couldn’t perform any role; I have to say, everyone was surprised by how well he managed his role.”
“A person who can listen to twenty-seven countries at the same time, who can communicate well with them and who has a clear idea of what direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union? at what number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheese.
Vicenova has further focused on a program that is key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the successful presidency of the Czech Republic in the past year.
The Czechs had to deal with the upcoming financial crisis; they overcome this crisis and organized a summit of Eastern Partnership.
She said the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused significant damage to the Czech Republic.
The representatives of the Czech Republic in the EU are currently very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing breakdown.
It is also necessary to adopt a new EU seven-year budget, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these questions are in the upcoming program.
The ambassador reminded the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "About Europe, an Understood Language."
“I really don’t like shortcuts, foreign words and a jargon that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people don’t try to sell curved or round corns, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our sort of cheese.”
It also intends to use the EU environment more effectively and to attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered euro-skeptic; as well as people noting rather the negative and not the positive sides of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are guilty of this: for example, the humility of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with a little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, it highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Let’s believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the French next to me says, ‘Oh, what about the meeting, again the Visegrad group?’ and he’s not happy with it.
In the future, the Union of Vicenova anticipates mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the participating states.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have a Schengen area, and we have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time it was said that countries that want must unite, while those that don’t want can stay on the side.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be truly a two-speed Europe,” Vitsenova expects.
In this regard, she emphasized the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all issues relating to the whole EU should be discussed by all the member countries, and not only the Eurozone members.
History of Brand:
The IBM innovator enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest is likely to be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company’s longevity was set by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, the elder.
He believed in his motto that many world problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!", thus, became a stamp around which the life of the future giant was evolving (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935.
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built up.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the next hundred years, we hope to even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, the current CEO of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
The complex system
In the 1930s Watson approached the question of care for employees just as Bata in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were one of the first American employees with paid holidays, employer insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same advanced is IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application for talented people. It was one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, giving it a great choice.
It agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which the woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; now she is Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
In the last few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brain attacks, during which many future innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - about half a million people work in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm’s strong position in the business is provided with strong internal and external images.
“From the beginning, from the point of view of the concept, IBM was rather an organization rather than a technology company,” said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM, Rosabett Moss Canter.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Jodge Coloni from the consulting company Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between getting out of the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or "Blue Giant", as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, five of her employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a strip code and a disket.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (the first place is Apple), overcoming Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally bound to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily puts the foundation on several platforms – if they don’t work, it will give up them.
This makes it different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, who is based and experiences a fall on Windows, its operating system.
The prospective technology
IBM’s main income is from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with a capital twice less, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets for $15 billion; at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
Until now, it seems that IBM has not damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of the IBM shares has risen to a record 120 percent; the net earnings of the company are constantly rising.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, we can expect that even if another crisis develops, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM’s history: from the cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. its original name "Computer, Tabulation, Records Corporation" was quite complicated.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand, which was used for the company’s departments in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the future of IBM was based on the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as legendary "table clocks", i.e. clocks that fixed the time when employees come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also headed the company’s supervisory board.
Flint hired the director of the competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
Then the manager drove the IBM founder into the shadow – Watson’s ideas remain the foundation of untouchable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson was the head of the company until 1952.
IBM, as clearly from the name, began with the production and sale of various equipment for the business - from cheese knives and meat cuts to cash.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the revenue doubled to nine million dollars, and the company’s large-scale expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important for the company that after almost forty years his place in the chair of director occupied by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM started developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 - human flights to the moon.
At the same time, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time purchasing the consulting department PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and high added cost services.
In the last three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to reasonable use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban management.
IBM has recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen to control the entire trading cycle.
The traditions of IBM are strong even in our country.
In former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be simultaneously located in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its department in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class speech recognition research group also works.
Rihtarzhova about his wrong husband:
Ivy, let yourself be foolish, I don’t need him anymore!
Darina Rihtarjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarge (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she doesn’t want to wait anymore, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
“Peppa can return home, but no longer as my partner,” Rihtarjova explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova gave her blood to Bartoshova in her house in the summer, she probably had no idea of what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Iveta to leave Rzychan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, making it seemed to have merged with her husband’s novel; and now she finally forgiven him.
It doesn’t matter with whom his wife is sleeping.
Even if Rihtarj and Bartoshov are separated, his wife won’t accept him with widespread arms.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him.”
“But he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom something connects me,” said Rihtarzhova, adding that she has already released from her husband and insists only on mutual virtues.
So far Joseph has nothing against that his wife has rejected him.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’m going to be with Iveta, I’m not going to change it.”
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union continues to function; I am responsible for repairs, garden, house and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate completely normally, but we don’t share the bed anymore,” Richter told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rihtarjova finds a new love, he will not interfere with it.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom she has a friend.
I know it’s my fault, I’m in love with Iveta and I’m in full responsibility,” Joseph concluded.
The worst women’s habits: Do they bother you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, will you find yourself in the following lines, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you’re always going to the shops?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like buying on large sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who of you will refuse to walk through clothing stores in search of the perfect sitting clothes and measure it (will, in different color variations) in sample?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can become a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait for you outside.
Eternal dissatisfaction
“I’m too thick?”
“I need to lose at least five pounds – can I start doing gymnastics?”
“Are you still tracing to me?”
Do you know these phrases?
Yes ?
Then you belong to a group of women interfering with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to constant complaints of the partner on their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and purity.
It is like an infinite story.
Glass washing, dust cleaning, floor washing, dust cleaning, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
You’re criticizing your partner for he’s coming to a clean cabin in dirty shoes; children for dirty in a clean cabin and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so difficult to clean up?
In the event that you suffer from this "abstinence", try to realize that falling into the extreme is not good; and that in your family order and purity should not stand in the first place.
A harmless desire for purity can threaten your relationship as well as the whole family.
The Desire to Command
“Smake your clothes into the basket.”
“You’re going to wear dirty shirts tomorrow?”
“The wet towels for the dishes should not lie on the floor.”
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may consider it very boring.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men had understood this, women’t have to command them so often.
Clothes
Some women like to blurry, offend and blurry intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, each of us dissolves spellets.
Let’s be honest, this is the apparent nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more serious spellers, women who often spell and neglect others. They, especially in the female working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of the transmissions of Yagra and Vorachek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two resulting transfers of the hockey attacker Yaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Carolina.
In both cases, Claude Giro used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player of the match.
Two resulting match transfers also belonged to the player in the same team with Jagr Yakub Vorachek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he predicted a great evening.
“I told him before the match that he would beat the hat-trick.”
“I felt that.”
“Sometimes you feel such things,” Jagr explained, after whose actions, Zhira hit a goal at the first chance that Flayers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech trace".
The closing Harikines Vorachek conquered the shabby and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who hit between the circles.
A second before the first break, the domestic player Patrick Dwayer reduced the gap with a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second time again led the Flyers.
Especially the fat.
After the resulting submission of Yagra, he scored the third goal; later his hit was converted into the fourth goal by Wayne Simonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the league, but he's exactly in the top three," Jagr said, praising his center.
“I’ve never thought that at the end of my career I’d be playing with a hockey player like him.”
“It makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
“All these years in the NHL my team colleagues tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rutu and the penalty of Dwayne, reducing the gap to one goal.
The further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
“The Pranger worked great in our area.”
“He hit the shape, I accelerated, and Reed passed to the far end.”
"I targeted him and I'm glad that it worked," Voraček described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory brought Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
Defense team Montreal Czech Yaroslav Spachek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to injury of the upper body.
Together with the experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the penalty series.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was saddened by a large number of injury in the back, as the match ended with only five defenders.
“The situation is bad.”
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Whatever it is, we can't do anything with it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
“The replacement was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
“We had to simplify the game, move the shabby out of our zone.”
“What was our weak side,” added P.K. Subban’s defendant.
After thirty attacks, the Czech goalkeeper Andrzej Pavelec helped Winnipegz defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The goals of the Jets, which broke a five-match series of defeats, were hit by five different players.
Dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourist agencies could work in former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was strictly restricted, tour agencies of that time were mainly selling tours to countries of the socialist block.
Thus, on holidays Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which caused significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips through socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter-invitation from that country was needed; otherwise individual travel was impossible.
At the time, tour agencies offered travel to the West, but it was necessary either to stand in a row all night, with a bed bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that was not all yet.
Currency permission was necessary for traveling to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely converted; without the exchange permit it was impossible to get cash (Western currency) for the trip to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottage and summer houses, this habit remains to this day.
After 1989, the tourism in the Czech Republic, thus, experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 vacation in Germany or Bulgaria was the culmination of our trips, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular now Croatia as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s the need for a visa to the neighboring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This set the start of a huge wave of short travel mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovak could not be saturated with traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents as their revenue at the time was not enough for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (conserves, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our living level and average income increased, which around 1997 led to another important circumstance.
Since 1997, the increased demand has allowed tour agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines. Compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution took place in 2000. The large demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter flights from the Czech Republic will be shipped on twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. canceled the need for a visa for Czech tourists. Our country, thus, forever joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand crowns per person during their holidays abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The general assembly has to elect the president, the threat of the pat is returning
There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting that will be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what rules of the election to follow.
Without this, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrji Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclik desire to lead the Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June. Leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Gashek era again drowned football into a gap between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
It became quite obvious on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smichov, as negotiations remained blocked, not just by the election procedure.
No agreement was reached on the one who has the right to vote in the general assembly — only the legitimate representatives or also the officials to whom the powers were granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on the powers granted is impossible.
The disputes on the rules of the election, however, continue.
The Executive Council also did not help too much, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly engaged in this issue.
The views on the methods of voting have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the cat?
“The challenge is whether to follow the established standards or to find a different model,” says one of the Vice-Presidents of FAČR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided by the Charter, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received great support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is agreeing to a compromise - to consider the winner of the election candidate with the highest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the total percentage the winner must obtain at least two-thirds of the votes.
"Therefore, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers," Freedom agree with the arguments of Moravia. He says it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A little suddenly, Thomas Paclik agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates, the constitution-defined rules of the election make Pelta more than other candidates.
“I would like the elections to go as much as possible according to the law.”
"I want to avoid any representative foolishness, as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzhen, who is the first candidate; and in his statements he mainly opposed Pelt.
Pelt remains optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that in the future candidates will cooperate constructively.
“All the emotional breaking will calm after the national team’s expected outcome to the European Championship today.”
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonec. Of the three candidates he has the most experience in football management both at professional and regional levels.
Rihanna is more deterrent.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very uncertain.”
“This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules.”
“This could cause another collapse of the general meeting.”
“I hope that a healthy sense will win,” Rachel said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if the football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was supposed to deliver, among others, the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucheru and Reichla to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to technical failure. They sought an alternative to deliver a part of the Executive Committee to the place of the match.
After all, the meeting at the level of the minister, which is expected on Wednesday, may be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobeš, would like the opponents of the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
A lot is placed on the map: government subsidies; the credibility of football; and the planned joint meeting of the ČSTV with the new Czech Sports Directorate after the financial problems of Saskia.
Patslik goes into the presidential struggle because he doesn’t see the right candidate
If before an extraordinary general meeting the football leader Plzhen Thomas Patslik would see a strong candidate that would meet all his demands to the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even claim for a high post.
“If I had been a decent candidate, I would fight for him and I would not participate in the struggle.”
“But such a man has not yet been found,” said Patslik ČTK.
The motive for Paclik to enter the struggle against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the supposed favorite of the election, from entering the FAČR administration.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that in case of victory, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is planned.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager, not too connected to football life.
“I’ve talked with a few people that I could have meant.”
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to have a relationship with the Czech football.”
“I would like to change this opinion,” he said.
Currently, the main disagreement of Paclik and Pelta is linked to the relations of the latter with Roman Berbr, the president of the regional football association in Plzeň. Berbr is a man of contradictory reputation, who behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist, capable of influencing the voices of the delegates of the general meeting.
Patslik thus believes it is unacceptable that Pelta be president.
“If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward.”
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," Paclik said.
He suggests that a few years ago the name of Pelta was recorded during the phone hearing during the investigation of the corruption case; Pelta managed to avoid the sentence.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelta’s victory would bring to football.”
“And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclik. he now does not mention his previous statement that he “will sell the Plzhen club if Pelta becomes president.”
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This opinion divides another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, which ended fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would turn.”
“He is very capable.”
“I can present him to the head of the team.”
“He can’t manage the association.”
“I also don’t swallow my nose into what I don’t understand,” said Patslik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judge brigade led by Ludek Makela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik claims that he will risk managing the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the Plzhen team, which with his help celebrated his first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change to the better.”
“To limit the influence of some groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to disgusting situations,” said Paclik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzhetinsky.
One of its priorities will be strengthening the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it will lobby at the highest political level the allocation of more money to sports from the lottery fees.
“This is one of the key things the new president has to deal with.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly declare where the money will go,” he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeň club a burden, although he claims that the president of the FAČR should be independent.
Pelta is linked to the Apples, and Reichl to the Prague Duchy.
“This is not the perfect option.”
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritic transfer of my shares to someone else, once I'm going to go back there in six months," Patslik says.
Pelta has promised new FAČR rules that will allow to avoid the Election Party
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new rules of the FAČR to avoid disputes about the rules of election in the future.
Before negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, Jablonec official remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election struggle will noticeably distract today’s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he will focus on both representation and receipt of funds.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general meeting. The two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to head the association,” says the man, mainly associated with the club Jablonec; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is sufficiently experienced to manage the Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that ruled during the time of Ivan Gashek's rule.
“Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June.”
“If different representation methods were not adopted, we’d already have a president since September,” Pelta said.
He treated the rewrite of the key document of the civil association as a false goal for delegates.
“If I become president, I’ll consider it my personal task, and I’m going to take my personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, he says he does not try to stand out on the background of the competitors.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Yindrich Reich, whom he appreciates for legal education; he is quite aware of the fact that his competitor candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He has been in football for more than a year and has achieved a certain success."
“In any way, his attacks were unpleasant, and many people were surprised by the methods of his presidential campaign.”
"It's still why some of them now doubt his true personality," Pelta said about his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the statements he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the whole football.
“I would also try to stop all the incidents, starting with the case of the Bohemians or the consequences of the corrupt scandal last year.”
"I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors immediately after that to guarantee sufficient amount of money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head will not result in the dismissal of the staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual employees."This was his message to Strahov, where the prolonged period of intergovernment causes a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that delegates will arrive in Nimburg on Thursday not useless.
“If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it.”
“Football needs the trust he can get only by finally choosing his leader,” says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career as a functionary.
Rachel promises that under his leadership the FAČR will begin to work actively.
If at the meeting on Thursday Yindrji Reichl, the current vice president, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be unhappy.
Rachel promises that if he is chosen, a time of hard work will come.
He wants to make changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for the individual fields in football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of former president, Ivan Gashek.
“As a president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events.”
“I don’t want to say that I’ll do everything myself,” Rachel said in an interview with CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate powers in the executive committee so that each member is focused on a specific field.”
“I will carefully distribute my tasks so that in each of these segments football will take big steps forward.”
“It will probably not like many people, as it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement probably forced him to doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put my palms in the wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
“Many people told me I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others will come.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t give up,” he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
“There’s been a lot of work done in those two years, and I don’t want to overtake it all.”
"There have been processes that can bring results in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, will be elected, the situation in the Association may return to what was before Gashek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s what Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent in.”
“It’s surrounded by people who would play football so that it’s only available to the elected.”
“I can be accused in a lot, but not in subjectivity.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the elected minority,” Rachel said.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“While many people are trying to say the opposite, I’m planning to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the struggle in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While the club manager Plzhen Thomas Paclik has entered the presidential struggle, Rachel does not dare to evaluate his chances of winning.
“Therefore, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success,” Rachel said.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself in the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Affirming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning credit to the Czech football," he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he worked great at Plzene this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
"He't get to distort the facts for his advantage," Rachel said about his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
jump into the water.
by Julia Stanek
Children's swimming pools with universal fiber optics and state-of-the-art swimming pools in Budapest. Travellers can try the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meader couldn’t do during his research trips over the past a year and a half: without his bathing costume.
Leaving on the back in the water, she looked up on the taste-shaped couples, swimming to the marble herubies waiting for her at the edge of the pool and loved the carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-nuvo.
She rushed to add every favorite swimming pool to her blocknote – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
Architecture historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools – and now has gathered impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming), where it went all, from the public swimming pools in Munich to the historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Town.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and in one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real enthusiast of bathing culture.
She is very little enthusiastic about sport, says Meader, but in the water it’s different.
The only disadvantage is that swimming fans should be calmed with the blue cave plate and the odor of chlorine, while runners can breathe the attractive odor of cave forests or listen to the joy of birds in the park.
“One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful swimming pools.”
When the surface doubles architecture
The swim in the pool and the excavated oils in the sauna are a healing factor in the bathrooms so significant because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such a job. "instead of the floor in the pool you have a surface of water."
“The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is visually reflected: high roofs, colored plate and tramps.
The 190-page illustrated edition of "The Joy of Swimming" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oasis - and causes you a desire to jump into the water.
The collector of waterfalls Meder found several outstanding copies during the research in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in the cartus cave (Cave Bathroom in Mishkolz-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberin), as well as great therapeutic bathrooms, such as the 100 year old Sečeni Bathroom in Budapest.
From many heated open swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, a stunning view is opened. You can see all of Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or see the snowed Arlberg from the open swimming pool in St. Anthony. And in the steam there is a window that allows you to see what’s happening on the ski.
Per the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The Aquarium in Etsal looks like an UFO, just landing in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open rocks rise from it, which appears very small on the background of the Estonian Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwartzwald
The Meders swimming pool collector not in every swimming pool encountered the smell of chlorine.
The bathrooms named Arpad in Bakeshab are so strongly smelled by oil that you may be difficult to believe that you are in a healing source.
The water is almost black from the wire that lies to the skin as soon as you get immersed in the pool - a healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meader, however, at a certain moment was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open pool of the Czech bathrooms in Lugachovits, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by the architect Dušan Yurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the visible windows of the red-white-yellow building in the style of ar-nuvo, she saw the cranes growing between the cave plates.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot traces, the amazing swimming pool in Schwartzwald - The Palace of Thermal Water in Bad-Wildbad.
You will discover not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritan Hall in the Alhambra style, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace - the favorite swimming pool of the Irish Meders swimming pool - and not just because it comes from Schwarzenegger.
"This is a real achievement - so mastery combine such different architectural styles," Meader says.
Drinking into a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary task.
Speculation on Agricultural Products
The Doyce Bank investigates trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Doyce Bank stop trading agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkerman gave the working group a task to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
of Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 percent of Germans believe it is unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trade in agricultural products as trade worsenes the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the game of stakes on the world’s commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The campaign of consumer interests is directed against Doyce Bank chief Joseph Akkerman, although large bank houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
Initially, goods rates were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have renounced the rules of supply and demand - and are getting to the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkerman responded to the criticism. He promised to investigate the accusations and said that no trade "will not risk the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decrease or stop completely.
Akkerman works on his images.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode rejoiced the news, highlighting his critical attitude towards the financial sector. “Food prices are an overwhelming example of how unthinkingly banks are currently acting against the common interests.”
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Akkerman has a certain duty, according to Bode.
“Doyce Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments that make cash bets on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s about hungry people or the reputation of Doyce Bank.”
The quick reaction of Akkerman first surprises, but in the meantime the director would like to have a perfect image just a few months before the end of his office stay.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not go to the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also practically doesn’t have to worry about expenses – the consequences will have to be dealt with by his successor.
Each second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
Today, more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
The study was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than eleven percent believe that investments that make a interest on food prices are acceptable for Doyce Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank is involved in such a trade. According to the study, each second would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to speculation of goods.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would think about closing the account and moving to another bank.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg of Vinsovsky
The Pavilion of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, empty and was abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass hills, courageous that expressed faith in technical progress.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its light steel and glass heating structure.
The building is considered a wave in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built a pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he became famous throughout the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister – a glass-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Railway Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 – and is often referred to as the "20th Century House" for this reason.
Anyway, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna got a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition is getting worse and worse.
The architect Adolf Krishanitz to this time restored the pavilion, which was called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum - the department of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in all respects a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arko, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belvedere in 2007, contributed to the new initiative.
Husslein-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career in youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guardians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building will be used.
The new museum should have a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Watruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. The office building should also be built.
Strict control and limited budget
Krishnatz was then the ideal candidate for the implementation of the project.
He was known, of course, thanks to the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "exclusive important place" where he visited exhibitions "about every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems arising during the last rebuilding were much more serious. The building was a "energy absorber," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, an enhanced glass fiber secure glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-performance secure glass.
The steel translations of the heat bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbest was removed from the roofs.
Two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, the burning light hole between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still the elegant Pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red and brown color of corrosion protection.
The Hall of Cinema is the same as it was before.
All this under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find a material that was good, cheap and would be approved by the museum administration," says Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven plain in the submarine.
The building remained flexible and light despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Krishnatz noted recently that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical story of "cats in the city".
Such an architecture is "not always in its place" and yet wants to "stimulate true awareness."
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, as in the planning of the city there was an unexpected success. The fully reconstructed "court of the main station" with offices and residential property grows around the Swiss Garden.
The house of the 21st century can be supplemented with the second building of the Krishanitts - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is to negotiate with the city about its location in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn Plans Millions of Winter Anti-Crisis Package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in winter.
The number of employees should double.
The costs will amount to millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and delays in trains.
Referring to the domestic anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the newspaper Bill reports that a total investment of about 300 million euros is planned by 2015.
Investments are intended to improve the performance of locomotives and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and attracted employees engaged in the cleaning of snow from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the necessary shells within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellation and delays of trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant trouble with passenger transport as it lacked reserves at the time of worsening weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays with the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also for many years had to check the ICE trains much more frequently after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at the main train station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay millions of pounds fine in the US
New trouble came after concerns around Joseph Akkerman, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is threatened with a multitude of millions of pounds in the US.
As if Doyce Bank had little problems in the country, the past of an industrial giant in the U.S. is now pushing him. Doyce Bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm the disputes arising after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), a regulator of the financial market, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to cheat credit unions to buy their financial products.
The price of bonds dropped sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
“We are happy to resolve this problem without the parties being brought to court,” said Deutsche Bank’s representative in New York City.
The bank did not recognize its guilt.
The same goes for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debby Mats welcomed the operational reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and interferes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is struggling to compensate for the losses that are leaked from billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also turned attention to other major banks and in the summer raised the case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspicious mortgage bonds are so-called securities provided by a pillar of mortgage loans.
It is supported by internal loans.
This determined the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble in the U.S. real estate market broke in 2007.
The U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the edge of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the U.S. are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims requiring compensation or punishment of fraudsters.
The Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA) is the largest claim wave.
It accuses 18 major international banks of acquiring $200 billion deposit agreements from U.S. credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Deutsche Bank is also threatened to be prosecuted by the FHFA for numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt to take on responsibility for "significant losses", but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Doyce Bank rejected claims as unfounded and announced the intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
The financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares for a total amount of more than $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always said he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report of IBM changed its opinion about investments in this industry.
According to Buffett, he should have been much earlier to understand that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investments were regarded as a Knight’s act.
IBM, the veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. business television channel CNBC, Buffett that he has acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his participation until recently.
He praised the management that managed to gain profits even during the financial crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been focused on such high-performance IT services as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which today has been over 100 years, also offers software and consultancy services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technological companies.
He claimed that he only invested in the company he understood.
and invested, for example, in cargo rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in machinery.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in the long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and with the help of skilled investments built on its basis one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained humble.
making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unfaithful instinct in making money brought him the pronouncement of "Oracle of Omaha".
IBM’s stock price rose by one percent before the opening of markets after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The "Blue Giant", as they also call IBM, is on a stock exchange of more than $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Buffett said he did not intend to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
The inevitable danger
After the detection of the "cake in Zvikkau", the Turkish media began to doubt the rule of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers talks about a “blood ideology” which is now regaining on the surface.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern became a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears to life. Such right-extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the fires in Melbourne in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
It has never raised doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-extremist network now discovered has such a scale that is not fully aware yet.
"Renewal of Blood Ideology?" was the headline of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be trapped into the right-to-right balloon.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, reminding the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket against the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish politicians celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the hiring of labor.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a history of success.
"A gift from Germany for the 50th anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition Hürriyet also did not miss the opportunity to carry out this parallel.
"It begins to smell badly" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He notes that people who paid taxes were killed and their work made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The behavior of the police and the subsequent successful clouds were sharply criticized on German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors were wondering why the German authorities did not think earlier about monitoring suspects in the right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors came to a fairly sharp rhetoric: “If they will continue to act in the same way, immigrants will have no choice but armed self-defense.”
“This will be the best self-defense.”
“The world in Germany depends very much on how the entire network will be opened and the legality of punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes in Melne and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the world in Germany being threatened.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks living here that there is a danger on them, and to the Germans that uncertainty and indifference can flow into real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat past mistakes.
The Turkish press in that period primarily condemned the German police failure after the attacks.Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burns in Zolingen, but participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne accepted his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech counted the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he determined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current lighting in the Turkish media once again showed how deepened since then the uncertainty of many German Turks to the current German state.
Clearly showing what we need to do now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking Scandal in the Lake Zurich
Most of the European banks leading the risk policy are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has hardly bankrupt during the financial crisis and since then it has continuously fought both with the one and the other crisis.
Now to return it to the right course must the German.
Alex Weber probably did not suspect that he was going to play this role.
In July, after his effective withdrawal from the post of Chairman of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he will start working on the not less effective post - Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was obviously enthusiastic, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its regained strength and made some friendly comments to his future colleagues.
“UBS has managed to change to better.”
“I’m looking forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grybel.”
But in September it became clear that it would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London crossed the bank’s security system and lost about €1.7 billion.
UBS executive director Oswald Grybel, a bankier not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS is considered a sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally enter his post?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, it will take the post of chairman in May, not in 2013.
It will not be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional bankier, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly turned out to be responsible for the strategy of the bank, which once again proved that he has long deserved the title of "the biggest banking scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very big – until recently it has managed the world’s largest assets – and on the other hand, it’s not out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank does not save anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank connects the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time gentle asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having in management more money of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, he joined the world’s largest banking league.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former bankier and banking professor, who has long been teaching at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I’ve always brought my UBS students as a model of a good bank.”
“When you know what we know now, you can ask me how I could be wrong.”
He really mistaken.
Only in 2007 it became clear that something is going wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, the executive director Peter Wufli - who was considered an outstanding intellectual and in the same degree brilliant bankier - suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we could guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on sub-standard securities and was forced to write billions.
You want to believe, you don’t want, but UBS an increase in capital by 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank really managed to find investors — but investors, whose services many banks would have recently kindly refused — one very untransparent Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden so much that even its name was not.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it was much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second wage chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
Due to the lack of investments during the financial crisis, UBS was faced with the threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become the co-ownership of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks founded in a small country.
Finally, UBS's final balance in 2007 was five times higher than the total production in Switzerland (see schedule).
“We can’t save UBS for the second time,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and stated that it was ready to transfer the data of wealthy customers who with the help of the bank had escaped from taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business revenues plus fines.
UBS, therefore, more or less acknowledged that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost what has always been its advantage in the struggle for rich customers, the secret curtain.
After this scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board later resigned, and
The outcome of customer money has begun.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main directions of its activity – in investment due to failure speculations and in asset management as a result of aid and encouragement of tax evasion.
And just everything calmed and it seemed that UBS managed to break the situation as this disaster happened with an affair-trader. The only trader dropped €1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
It is clear that risk management in the investment department does not work yet.
“The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also does not doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk control tool.”
The caution for a long time has made Swiss bankers the guardians of the world’s largest assets – not an excessive risk, but the security for the money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
The seafood of Swiss banks has become a symbol of unmistakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the finest taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, but it’s a little more.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on the Banhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by the snow hips of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find such jewelry firms as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks were located here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the Palace of Crédie Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Ber.
The heavy door leads to the UBS vestibule.
Along the marble-covered walls stand large leather canvas. Near the emblem of the bank a large indicator "Seef".
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss concepts of banking - or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He would not want to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he also works with two major banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big – in the investment banking, where Anglo-Saks are very active.
The Switzerland has nothing to add here.
“And if there is something, then they have long been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon habits.”
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it the first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe lost so much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became obvious on October 15, 2008.
“At that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertaken the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” Lucas Hessig writes in his book Crash UBS.
The politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it come to that?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the amount of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks united into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which at the time of merger was too big for a small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This helped the fact that two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but graduate bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to turn the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, UBS Group Executive Director from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought Wolffley and Ospel are a dream team,” says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of the model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, who has gone the whole way up, starting with a stage in the bank."
But Ospel eventually got on Wolfley.
Woolfley could make a critical mistake. ”He decided that his models were reality,” says Geiger.
“It is tragic.”
It may be tragic.
Pride is before defeat.
UBS employees remember the meetings of board members, on which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to push Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "turn table" where the successes of the banks were brought.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this path.
UBS was the largest player in currency and public securities trading.
According to that parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had faults in U.S. mortgage products.
To lock the hole, UBS went into an adventure that hardly cost him life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its founded hedge fund invested in U.S. substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that united securities based on U.S. mortgage loans and sold them further - continuing to carry the risk itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way to get out of this process, UBS did not stop.
“UBS purchased until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already in fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.

One managed after the other had to go as attempts to arrange the bank were harder than it seemed at first.
Posts in UBS have turned into a child's game with chairs and remain unreliable until today.
Anyone who leads this huge bank is faced with an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned his back to all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has an idea - to give up investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go so far.
However, it is clear that investment activity needs to be significantly reduced.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly separated from his predecessor Grubel.
During the past time he managed to show character and now, as the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday, he is leading UBS on a permanent basis.
Erntti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It will reduce 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions will probably be asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly he has so far only said that they and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.

The thieves fill the cities
Grachies are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very intelligent birds will no longer be able to get out of the cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Thieves for centuries have been part of the urban landscape, but inhabitants complaining of dirt and noise, in many settlements it becomes more and more.
But the problem of birds has not yet been resolved.
At the first symposium dedicated to the bruns, in the city of Ler in Eastern Frisia, experts claimed that it was no longer possible to expel the bruns from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of protected grains, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed traditional habitat areas.
The hunting, expanding construction and the throwing of traditional for nesting trees complicated the life of birds.
The thieves are protected.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest of Yevre, Dipholce, Achima under Bremen and Lera there are large colonies, containing more than 600 parental couples.
The unnecessary project of the shotgun in Lera caused unapproved newspapers in 2005.
The critics described the hunting of birds in the hunt and the hunting of them with the palms as a special cruelty.
“Ordinary moving and scratching don’t give anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever from Lera.
Destroying a nest with a water stream or a tree rubble often has unwanted consequences, said Environmental Expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are spreading, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas."
Fear is possible only in the form of an exception near hospitals, homes of elderly and schools.
“We have to live with them, getting rid of them is not an option.”
In the gap from the surrounding areas, the problem in cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Keller.
A combination of frightening birds from those in need of protection of residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of benzopils" was the slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who is for a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational bridge route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where on the information stands is given information about the life of very intended graces.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion about the complaints about the noise produced by birds. "the noise transmits a lot of information.
The mind and softness of these birds have entered the legends. Graci often not only use the tools to conquer the stunted piece, but they also make the tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measure of bird mind on four spots.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to put on the plate to obtain a mole linen.
Without special training they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to break the plate.
In another experiment, reasonable games had to solve a more difficult task.
The researchers placed a small wire with a mole linen in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get the crop with the key.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make cracks and used the cracks to catch the wire for the hand and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four games have managed to do this from the first attempt.

Following an attack on Elder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty square in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player simulated, and showed him a yellow card.

The winning goal was hit just before the final slide.
Turkey at that time lacked football happiness in Zagreb.

Although there is no doubt now that coach Gus Hiddink will now release a place on the team's square, which reached the third place in 2002, the Croats are for the fourth time in the final tour of the European Championship.
The Turks managed to start perfectly in the eyes of 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium.
The remote blow of Seljuk Inan in the seventh minute was in the stand, and the attacker Kazim Kazim failed to break the ball into the network.

Mass murder – human measurement
Peter Englund’s “Beauty and Sadness: The Personal Story of the First World War” begins with a long list of acting persons from which the heart falls.
Here is the advice to read further: carefully cut this page and use it as a stick.
You’ll get acquainted with these people very close as Mr. Englund tells you, and this list of acting persons will be your GPS, your lightning at those moments when, like one of these men and women, you’ll get out of the road and lose yourself in the darkness of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "the work on anti-history."
It has little known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, famous journalists or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
It’s not so much a book about what was, – explains he, – how much “a book about what it was like.” It’s about “sentiments, impressions, experiences and state of spirit.”
The book "Beauty and Sadness" spelled together the experience of the 20 years of war of more or less unnoticable men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolchildren and botanists to mountains, doctors, emergency drivers and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets caught, loses his hand or leg, falls out of fool or dies.
Their lives are melted here as church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are shut down at this time.
Mr. Englund’s Book – a deviation from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a heavy war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sadness" skillfully gives the panorama of other theatres of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, Eastern Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall by bees; one of them encounters Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the mouse cage.
This is an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster, like the Hurricane Catherine, which smells of dustless dust.
When a canonade is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with children, will you stay in place or escape?
Anyway, who is it going?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why we need to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” says Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sadness" follows the fate of people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seafarer of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other already published materials.
Stories about their lives can be terrible or exciting, but they are mostly alive thanks to Mr. Englund’s gathered small moments and distractive details.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
Speaking the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere erzac."
“The replacement of aluminum, false aluminum, false rubber, paper bonds, wooden bulbs.”
He continues to talk about the erz-food in Germany.
It describes “the meat of pressed rice, cooked in barn fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato leather; shoes wrapped with wood.”
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes permitted in cabbage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories tell about honor and courage.
One American notices in himself the thirst to cruelty and says about war: “You feel that, in the end, it’s what men were created for, rather than to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whisky, a evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this show is a civilization and under your scratched shirt with the stickers is not hidden a barbar.”
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is most likely to die and no one will notice it and will not be angry.
“When a person gets aligned with the thought of self-offering, he would like to think that will happen before the public,” he writes.
But it’s the opposite, terribly like a “condemned man whom they hang secretly.”
Other comments are about the old Europe that is collapsing, and about new kinds of fear.
“The conflict has become more and more an economic competition,” says Mr. Englund, “a war factory.”
He notes the arrival of the one he calls "a new look in the beginner century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-shaped costume that arranges a cutting, sitting behind a written table."
People act unexpectedly: low acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund told us about the soldiers who were trying to get the prostitutes with a genetic disease to avoid the service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of honourable grapes, which soldiers bought and smelled from their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
“The desperate wrapped him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness.”
The proza of Mr. Englund, translated from the Swedish Peter Graves, is flexible, but unbrushed, perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war "liberated entirely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to ask why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or such novels as "On the Western Front Without Change" by Eric-Mary Remark, rather than exhausting historical work.
Mr. Englund’s book is part of this unshaped pantheon.
His book has the most amazing end I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I will not tell him.
But it’s as if he from the book reached a page with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hands and burned it with a stick.
After the previous error - thoroughly calculated reads
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were selected because at that time in Zucottie Park there should be the least people.
The operation was kept in secret from all, except for a few high-ranking officers, the rest were first told that they were going out for exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence emphasized how much importance the operation was attributed to the Department of Police.
There could not be a speech about the repetition of such episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of steam gas against the protesters, which contradicted the department rules and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupants.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to release from the Zucotti Park protesters began.
The authorities were preparing, watching how occupations were developing in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on the island of Randels with the count on Zucottie.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called workouts in the event of disruptions – counter-terrorist measures that involve the rapid movement of a large number of police officers – referring to the Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came in "the last minute," a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training."
"These several cops I know and who have been called for this matter have not been told that they are sent to the Zucottie Park," said the man who spoke under anonymous terms.
“The only one who knew they were going to Zucottie Park was at the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secret was the lesson that the city learned.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but resigned before hundreds of protesters who climbed in before the scheduled deadline, listening to these plans.
The operation on Tuesday was involved by staff of various police units, including forces from districts - police teams, which were commonly used to control the criminal surrounding areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like to work, come and leave the park during the day, making one hour of the night the right time to arrive.
“It was right to do this when the least people are in the park,” he said.
The rescue machines with projectors and speakers gathered on the Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The projector and the previously recorded announcements from the speakers seem to have scared many protesters.
When officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply gathered their stuff and left.
The police said the tents didn’t touch until 1:45 in the night, giving the protesters time to gather things.
Other police groups, according to witnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case there is a need for arrest in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Department of Police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police acted, and that the police were treating them brutally.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went to the west through the chest of the protesters’ personal stuff, including bags, plastic coats and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the health department teams followed her, gathering what was thrown.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave pulled out, the photos of this soon appeared on the internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp kicked themselves together for their hands.
And two men wrapped to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
To cut down the castles, rescue workers were called.
No arrests were held in the park around 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police.
Mr Brown said that approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for "brokening the public order and resistance during the arrest," he said.
The highest officer on the site was Joseph J. Espozito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department’s investigation police, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, “no managed the operation,” Mr. Brown said.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case it would be necessary to enter.
The gardens were placed on Cortland Street, in the quarter north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the quarter south.
The observers saw the police expanding the perimeter even further beyond the Zucotti Park.
At one point, the observers saw a group of police, many with shields, pulling people further.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to witnesses, released air from the police truck tires.
At some point, a piece of fanner flown out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
School staff association will submit to the city court for dismissal
A trade union representing hundreds of school service staff who lost their seats last month plans to go to court in the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory due to the disproportionate influence on schools where poor students are studying.
The judicial proceedings are probably the last means available to the trade union of the 37th district council seeking to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator of working with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on October 7 as a result of the trade union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to the medical funds managed by working groups to close a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
During hearing at the City Council last month, school chancellor Denis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the council members parished and told him that none in the budget was indicated that the assistant staff of the schools would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 district council that they appealed with a claim notification, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit was filed against him; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce a formal lawsuit to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city and list eight temporary dismissed workers as applicants, all of them black or Latin American women, as well as the majority of assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the law department of the city, said that the city did not see the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific positions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint that was available to the New York Times, the trade union focused on a series of dismissals in schools in the poor districts of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfinanced.
He points out that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island, and there were little dismissals in the Upper East Side or Tribecca schools, 17 school assistant workers lost their seats in district 23 in Braunsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in the free high school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the claim says: "This is not the areas of wealthy parents who can find money to replace budget failures."
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating the additional funding for each poor student entering school.
The trade union also claims that the school directors could be misleading with the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of the coordinators of working with the parents.
The notification used the word “excedence”, although “excedence” is often said when a teacher from the school’s payroll is moved to the list of existing employees whom the salary is paid by the central office.
“Six-six coordinators of working with parents were dismissed,” the lawsuit says, “and not simply translated.”
Mission Ends, Congress Ready to Agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the Rebellion in Libya.
Everything needed was to make the rebellion happen, the old dictator Muammar Gaddafi was caught and killed, and the U.S. intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution submitted by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Libermann (Independent, Connecticut), which praises the Libyan for the successful rebellion and the American troops for the "due".
“The meaning of this resolution is to honor the reputable people of Libya when they begin to restore their country,” Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations by both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no further discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties sparked with each other and with the White House on the formulations of a series of resolutions that approve or condemn the role of the U.S. army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The draft law was rejected by the House of Representatives with a significant majority of the votes of both parties and so never got to vote in the Senate.
But the same day, when the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support the proposal that would cut off the funding of the U.S. operation in Libya.
This left the U.S. mission in something like a legislative cleansing place – when Congress is irritated enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so evil to really throw the ground out of her legs.
The events overturned the unresolution of the Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on October 20 Kaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “will be praised by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and unusual resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thank the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Council for Foreign Affairs or will they divide the legislators like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
Representative Lugar said on Monday that he has not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the House of Representatives will vote this week for a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a major legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by the House of Representatives member Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else that will be submitted to the plenary vote of the Congress of this meeting.
Other legislators have not yet been able to submit their amendments to the plenary session, but not because they did not try.
The Goodlat amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that concern a wide range of issues that were submitted in this call.
Some duplicated — the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate — others were small variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of amendments to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and some more about "control of federal expenditure".
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors – mostly the newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resume – the opportunity to praise that they have “published” such a proposal.
The budget control act, which was passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-obligatory resolution to support the idea of such amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of mandates for Congressmen, and House of Representatives member José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to cancel the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
The amendment that prohibits gay marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as another amendment that prohibits flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of states are opposed to them.
Regardless of the efforts of Congress members to propose amendments, they are not moving faster than in the past years.
In the 111th call of Congress, the lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th they submitted 66.
This pace is slow compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when Congress members, according to the Library of the Senate, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did not more success than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but introduced to Congress it was actually in 1789.
“It was defeated but not defeated,” Giffords said in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her in an emphasis at a public event in Tucson, the House of Representatives member Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on Monday evening on the federal channel, singing a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Return Tomorrow" and said he wanted to heal more than to return to Congress.
Upon appearance at the 20/20 A.B.C. News program with Diana Soyer, Giffords hardly formulated suggestions and needed help in walking.
The program showed her difficult way of recovery after a bullet injury that broke the neck and broke the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphally voted on a border debt bill.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "hard".
Asked Soyer how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “It’s very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special edition "20/20", which was shown before the release of the new book of the spouses "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The special edition told about the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a bright head and a long shrimp on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later we see Giffords sitting in a wheel and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Cut the head.
Take your lips out.
And then her first word: “What?”
A few days later, Giffords said the second word - "toast," a request to change the menu for breakfast.
The video showed by EBC shows that music played a central role in Gifford's recovery: we see a congressman singing together with doctors "The Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Lopper and "The Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Soyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedures, said she didn’t remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told me that he was reading Gifford's article in the newspaper on the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to first ask about the six who were killed then.
The suspected attacker, Jerd Lee Laffner, is held in Missouri prison and is subjected to forced treatment while waiting for a trial.
“Many people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
“Though, hard and hard.”
One day, during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, “I’m defeated.”
“And I said, ‘Gabby, you’re not defeated,’ Kelly said.
You just beat.
And you will go through it, you will recover and return stronger than ever.
People feel more regret than respect.
The event was a holiday on the Wall Street, which gathered millions of dollars for the homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock singed a ballade about helplessness, disappointment and losses.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, seafarers, pilots and marine peasants stood around it.
The audience in the smoking praised him standing.
“The soldiers looked like heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, on which also was the then chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers wanted the best possible.
I know that.
But it was not a respect, it was a regret.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationships established between the army and often indifferent, sometimes admired American audience.
The troops are praised for their victims.
But praise has its price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if it is feeling regret to people in the form.
“We’re not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy.”
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger that returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about complaints take place quietly and only between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from the battle of the marine infantry, the resigned Colonel Mark Kenshne warned them that people not from the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration because they struck rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will think whether there is a “crude evil veteran” hiding under the mask, Khan said, who had been fighting in Iraq and, when he returned, occupied a high government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some intervievers carefully asked if he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington immediately after the battle.
Kenshne remembers how he said to his sons: "When you talk about your service, you should count on the negative effect."
The discomfort that the military is experiencing is partially derived from American indifference to wars.
The victories on the battlefield are rarely honoured by a country that is little familiar with the army and has little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was quite usual in the Second World War,” said Deputy Lieutenant General David Bernow, who commandered the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The army is assessed by the number of missions they made, by the number of companions they lost, or by the scale of losses.
The army faces increasing pressure on supporters of the fight against rape
This week, a historic trial will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army for accusations of non-violence.
If not, hundreds of prosecutors will be set up with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and on the 11th week of pregnancy, she said, was raped by her companion at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her cabin at the Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a companion-man carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room to drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But Texas's cousins remarked their fears.
I thought he was 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I’m sorry I didn’t listen to my instinct.”
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her behind, scratched and raped, she says.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former soldiers will look forward to the judgment in a historic hearing that will be held in Arlington, Virginia and which will decide whether to go to court the case they raised against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Ramsfeld.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with the widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, submitted in February by the lawyer Susan Burke from Washington, D.C., originally included 17 applicants, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men who all claim they were raped or threatened by sexual violence by their co-workers and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute in court or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she targeted the highest officers of the army because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
“Who are those people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also says that more than 400 other victims have been linked with it since February, many of whom may be involved in future searches.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the prosecutors in this case - put all the eggs in one basket, so to say, - she will open a lot of things if it is necessary to maintain pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defense under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBrad has taken steps to end the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal the defence strategy - mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim to the army for the damage caused by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court's Decision by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages caused by persons in military service.
“The expected damage relates to the risk present to the military service of the applicants,” the documents say.
The Ministry of Defense refused to comment on this story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the battle, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers teams play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the fighting zone.
The result: in the period between the two wars, 150 women soldiers were killed, two-thirds of them in battle.
The army is also time to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her temptation, three others are prepared.
In Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies for accusation of encouraging a feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, in the center of which the diagnoses of "personal change" that are put to victims of violence to remove them from service, is a common phenomenon, according to such activists as Anu Bhagvati from the human rights group Organization of women-warmen action.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veteran Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory practice of considering retirement applications from people who claim to have been threatened by sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Department of Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence, 3,158 attempts of rape were.
But, as you know, attacks are often not, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates this figure is approximately 13.5 percent of the alleged 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of judicial cases: in 2010 20 percent of known cases came to court – twice as low as in the civil justice system.
The prosecutors in the Berk case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she declared a rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker - from a cut on her hand - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge in a hearing, during which she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characteristic to the accused, who was ultimately justified.
“I remember the day when the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
“I thought I was born now – I escaped from the court room with a cry.”
“They sent me to the psychiatric department, and when I went out, I remember that my commander said, ‘This was not a trial over him, it was a trial for me.’”
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her a change in personality, which made her unsuitable for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable formulation, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her colleagues is going forward is a difficult question, says John Terley, a professor of law at the University of George Washington School of Law.
However, he notes: "I think they are able to move forward."
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I’ve been criticizing the Doctrine of Ferris all my life.
The army has been behind for decades because it has no incentives and remedies that it imposes responsibility.
He adds: "Chances are largely against them ... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Berk, the lawyer of the applicants, will gather hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
“We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is a reform,” she said.
Or until we die, depending on what will happen before.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was a regular guy who exposed his anti-immigration views on the internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who was aware of the July mass murder in Norway that killed 77 people, appeared to his first open court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time preparing for an attack on his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
It’s easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
“We’ve understood that getting to them is not quite difficult,” says Jamie Bartlett, the leading author of the recently published European cyber-populism report at the British Research Center DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the advertising tool of the site to distinguish the required demographic group with scientific accuracy – what marketers have done for several years.
The Bartlett team found a half-million right-wing fans across Europe and then promoted advertising to them, but instead of showing a new group or a dietary product, the advertising offered the user to submit a survey in which there were questions about their level of education, attitude to violence and optimism regarding their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries – even without leaving the office.
“This is a completely new way of conducting research,” says Bartlett.
Some results are not so impressive: right-wing online parties are mostly young men, unhappy with immigration.
But suddenly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just hiding behind the monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and policy scientists use the site to study everything in the world - from health issues to social trends that are expressed in 'Like', wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three records a day, Facebook’s “super-actual information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it gives the opportunity to study people to whom it is impossible to reach on the street with a blocknote.
"Before, if you wanted to survey people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
“You would have to join the party, and they would never accept you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you’re addressing them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Meghan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunk behaviors on Facebook were significantly more exposed to alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as their hostel tutors, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who too often updates drunk status.
“You can’t solve the problem without discovering it,” said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We’ve found a way to identify children from the risk group that otherwise would not be detected.”
Facebook also constantly extract various types of data about its users.
The data processing group of the site processed the statistics of the status of relationships and Valentine's Day, the appearance of voters in the middle of the term in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that only they have access to - cyber freedom champions long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a research they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined rules for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many users at least thought about what a researcher can watch behind their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using publicly available students' pages on Facebook.
“As much as they imagined, it was only between them and their friends.”
There is a question of methodology.
Even off-line has no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to find out how much information in the user’s profile and page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selvin says.
That’s why, despite his years of technological research, Selvin thinks that the blocknote and handbags are still the best research tools of those that can be used.
“Nothing can replace the way to the real world and the communication with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and the majority of social is still offline.”
“Cold and Unhuman”: Anders Bering Breivik will appear publicly before court for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who was aware of the organization of a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in a court in Oslo.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Tampliers of Norway,” he said in a statement.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge my actions, but I do not acknowledge my guilt.”
Judge Torkyel Nashheim broke Breivik during this monologue because he "not wanted to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a pre-written speech, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nashayem also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would take all visits and correspondence under strict control for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims visited the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others - to make sure that he is contained under a lock.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and unhuman," one of the survivors told the Norwegian channel NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally it became a little easier for me after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark costume and a blue shirt, Breivik retained calmness and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and went out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he is part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled he was not crazy, and said there was no evidence that he was acting with his fellows.
Some may calm the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” one of the victims’ relatives said.
“It would be much easier if it was so.”
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview that Show in the Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans can consider the greatest discovery in a newly discovered interview, which they remembered in front of the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
Of course, he was a designer, a dreamer, and he considered himself a hippie, but he was also a so-called organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business managers suffered from “the pain of thinking that a truly great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product is separated by a huge amount of tempting work.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a Triumph Nerves television series about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs on a unique long conversation.
About 10 years have passed since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he has already been working in his new computer company NeXT waiting for the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley’s interviews was used in the Nerds, he says the original interviews were missing during transportation.
Just after Jobs’ death, a full VHS copy was found in the director’s garage.
This filmed material, slightly edited, became the foundation for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusual here to expose his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different moments during the interview there are large intervals between questions and answers - thinking for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley’s questions, making him move faster to questions or phenomena of greater importance.
In Pixar, iPods, and iPhones’ Lost Interview there is something terribly prophetic when Jobs evaluates what, as he sees, different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
One thing to read about the post-death assessments of Jobs' work, but there is something wounding and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, an anxious dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
How He Learned to Lead Business:
“All the time in the business I’ve constantly asked, “Why do you do this?” and the answers that you always get, “Oh, it’s just doing so.”
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in the business.
That’s what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize accounts in Apple.
Developed by a method of recording expenses, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken from the roof and then adjusted with the “exactitude”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business expenses up to the smallest.
A joke about the pope:
Jobs details the "blue box" he smashed with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively break the telephone company and call on large distances for free.
A lot has been written about the device before, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the blue box as an act of power is infectious.
He tells how he and Voznyak tested the box using a phone-automatic, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We covered the Earth ball a half-dollar time, and you cried to the phone-automat, and it penetrated a minute later into the neighboring phone-automat,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young, and all we learned is that we could destroy something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both knew a little, but we could smash a small thing that could control a big thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think that without it Apple could ever appear.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous outcome that he and Voznyak practically dealt with, calling to the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking the Pope for the phone, with every effort trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two laughed out just before the Pope himself was raised to answer by phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold call of Bill Hülett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts for a frequency meter, he found Bill Hülett in his phone guide and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs received a summer work in Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what the company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer.”
He was a bag size, he had a small monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with it.
I was often driving at HP as a teenager and turning around that car and writing programs for her.
Improvised Innovation:
In several places in the interview, Jobs talks about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a bowl of installation plates, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days in the loan, he had to consider both the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember angry disputes... they screamed on me that it would take five years [collect a mouse that will cost $300], and I was sits on my throat, and I went out, and found a designer.”
Nine hundred days later we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About big companies that lose energy:
Long before he headed Apple's resurrection, Jobs exactly predicted how many industry leaders would be wrong in the vision of the situation and lose control over their market share.
“Let’s say you’re working on IBM or Xerox, so you’re making the best copy or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [this are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and people who make the product are pulled out of the decision-making site.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is drawn out of people who have no understanding of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times more, it could be Microsoft 90's.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a Form of Art:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of tempting work ... when you dissolve a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about her subtles.
There are compromises you need to go - some things you will not be able to force to make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your mind – these concepts – connecting them all together.
In the end, everything is reduced to the taste - everything is reduced to an attempt to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later to an attempt to bring it to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, and great artists steal.
We’ve always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made the famous Mcintosh was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to become the best information technology specialists in the world.
Without information technology, they would do amazing things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have a lunch with the opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind the closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question whether it will listen to the rejection of the President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated the lunch sponsored by a legal firm that will contest the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the issues on the agenda was a petition supported by 26 states, contesting the rapid health review adopted by Congress last year, a law that united the conservative activists of the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour turn is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is most likely to be a disruption in the presidential race, which will be at the very heart of the time when the court's decision will be announced.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law on health care should be repealed will most likely be Paul Clemens, who was the Deputy Prosecutor General during George W. Bush's presidency.
The legal firm of Clemens, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two giants of firms that helped sponsore the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-existing group constantly defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch, represents one of the trade associations that contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the gravity.
The lunch was held in the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court's meeting.
He was present, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a famous opponent of the health law.
Honorary guests at lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have visited the events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were obedient, they might fall under the Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "The judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a reporter, an honorary guest or mentioned in the program of such events."
However, the obvious proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to companies with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethical activists in the government.
“This shameful violation of ethics and indifference to the code is contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Case.
“The judges were drinking and eating at the official action to collect money with lawyers whose cases are now being discussed in court.”
Their appearance and contribution to the collection of money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are unlikely to pay attention to the critics who say they are very willing to mix the case with groups appearing in the case like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Jinnie, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical question to the judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first lawsuits against the law were submitted at the level of the first instance court.
Her critics demanded Kagan to refuse hearing on the case because she was too engaged in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Cagan did not show that she was going to do so.
Boeing receives a record $18 billion order for aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 large-range Boeing 777 aircraft and is likely to order 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the deal size is more than $1 billion.
It is unlikely that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the pre-successive price for all of these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Just as important is the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold reservoir of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft – 50 dual-passenger aircraft Boeing 777.
An incredible order was received from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the possibility to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price to $26 billion, Boeing said at Dubai Air Show 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can be proud of significantly better fuel savings and passenger convenience.
The price for six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neil Diora said.
“The quality of these specific buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producers.
Accordingly, they have not only the money to pay for aircraft, but also the rise in fuel prices, which usually damages airlines, as it is one of their biggest items of expenditure, not so losing because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders as prices grow, Diora said.
“They have a natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the broadband aircraft market and helps prevent Airbus SAS’ rival attempts to overcome his domination with its A350 airline.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which is competing just with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to increase the axis load after the buyers demanded to increase the load lift and flight distance.
The shares of Boeing Co risen by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister obviously lost in the election in Michoacán
Louise Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo from the IRP in the pre-election race.
The president’s sister, Felipe Calderona, seems to have failed to fulfill her application for the place of governor Michoacan during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped shake the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the place of the governor of the western state is named Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the IRP.
“The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is an alarm, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country,” Louise Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the following day after Sunday’s vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our workers at the election... They took the urns to vote, put obstacles... and forced people to vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing for a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Valyejo seems to have just a little overcome Calderon, who headed the ratings before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or the NPD, led by her brother, refused to recognize Valyeho as the winner.
Silvano Auréoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now belongs to the governor's chair, came to the third - a serious defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aurelius also refused to recognize preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state of Morella, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan for a long time dominated drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and metamfetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
The CIS mayor was killed a week before the election when he agitated for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race because of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how terrible the elections in Michoacan would look, the victory will give the movement of the party.
The person to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, greeted Valyejo and said: "I think this victory should be very exciting in the front of the next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has forced India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajjat Nag, managing director of the ABR office in Manila, said the two most rapidly developing major economies must "do everything they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS countries look at Europe’s difficulties “disproportionately” and said that Asian financial support side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
“It concerns us all.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be inadequate."
“So if China and India can help, it must be done.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, the loan funds of Italy have grown threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The expanding debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could again lead the world economy to recession, and has led to the calls of the leading developing economies to gather together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Naga predicted that any Asian aid will be made through the IMF, but said bilateral cooperation — such as the purchase of bonds from the EU financial aid fund, means to ensure financial stability in Europe — provides enormous strength in negotiations to Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and unreliable,” he said.
“We have great tasks and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“This is not a possible option, it is a mandatory condition, because where we will find a job for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that there is no sense for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warshni, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to helping Europe to the 1.2 billion Indian people, of which about 800 million live for 2 dollars a day or less.
“At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and travel for holidays to the sea, and that will not be well perceived,” he said.
Lee Hovell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public workers working in poorly organized, losing enterprises such as railways.
Mr Neg said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
The ABR forecast for 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with "reductive risks" due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets need to make “extreme plans” to protect themselves from decline and significant capital leaks from their economies.
Pentagon warns of potential reductions in defence spending
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warned on Monday at the Congress that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and trigger a financial chain response from the Pentagon corridors to the combat fields in Afghanistan on line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to a $450 billion cut in the next decade, but now fears that additional $600 billion cut or more can be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators to Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of the Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the result of the so-called sequester initiates a general 23% reduction and the termination of many new projects.
"That strong reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects inexhaustible - you can't buy three-quarters of ships or buildings - and will cause serious damage to other modernization attempts," Panetta wrote to senators.
“We will also be forced to dismiss many of our state workers and, as the reduction will be produced so quickly, we will almost have to dismiss the state workers to the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to combat readiness.”
The cuts will eventually affect the military units, Panetta said.
"While military financing in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequestrum, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contractual staff will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of the contracts and the supervision agreement that supports the army.”
“State staff will be reduced, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be broken.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequence of the sequestr in the Ministry of Defense will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power."
"We are firmly opposed to these dragon actions," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday evening when they published the letter of Panetta.
“This is not the output we can live with, and it is not the output we must force ourselves.”
“Sekvester is a threat to the interests of U.S. national security, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the letter of the Panetta or the latest warnings of the senators will lead to a budget compromise or will strengthen the calls for the liberation of the Pentagon from the cuts, we will see later.
Panetta was absolutely honest about possible cuts, though he came to work in the leadership of the Pentagon after many years of budget examinations in Congress and the White House and realizing that he is facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister drawn a disappointed picture of what can follow further – a army with a coat, but without a nucleus.
“This is a ship without sailors.”
“This is a team without a bullet.”
“This is the wing of the aircraft without sufficiently trained pilots.”
“This is a paper tiger, an army with castles, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his entry remarks in the Pentagon.
“This is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor preparedness and unable to fight with potential enemies.”
“In fact, it encourages aggression.”
In addition to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he said the new details of how cuts "create significant operational risks: slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limit our ability to be the first in deployment and reaction everywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single strike fighter F35, a planned new bombers, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal fighter vessel and a new ground fighter vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace the hammer.
Stop further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say this is the vital next step to improve and face the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to catch the lies
A foolish look at the latest titles shows how serious and universal deceptions and lies are in everyday life.
Republican president candidate Herman Kane is engaged in contesting accusations of sexual harassment by several women; each side accuses the other of lies.
The University Administration of Pennsylvania was charged with false testimony as they allegedly hid that the retired football coach was rapeing boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was captured when he told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lies destroy the carriers and destroy the countries.
New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weiner showed himself foolish, denying his outcomes that were quickly denied by undisputed evidence.
Former president candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial machinery during a campaign related to the hiding of non-marriage relationships.
And again, no one of those who lived at that time will never forget the media circle with President Bill Clinton, who is lying about his sexual relations with Monica Levinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud at school and college exams are a common thing.
There were cases when teachers gave students answers to the tests so that they had a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Teachers who must teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
During one day, research shows you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
Now it is supposed that a significant part of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study found that strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Detection of lies or deceiving lies is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like, let’s say, the sharad, where you have to scream “I’ve fallen!”, the detection of lies is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been dissolved.
The liars look in the eyes.
They aren’t always swallowed, swallowed, reddened or shaken.
It is not worth concluding that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to uncover.
An experienced liar detector can get to the truth by observing the structure of claims, the mimics, the structure of questions and the timelines.
I’ve spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a widespread and growing segment of false knowledge, and it’s clear that false detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and that helps to orient in our complex world—especially if your professional duties include recruitment, interview, negotiation or management.
Good liars are perfectly able to read others, making them feel unnecessary, controlling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that the extroverts are more frequent than the introverts, that men are more liar about themselves, while women are more liar about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people are less liar to their partners than the unmarried (but the liar they say is most often liar).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceiver, others will feel less guilty to deceive you.
How do I know if someone lies?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the “definition of the original state”.
This helps to provide a starting point for evaluating the changes further.
Watch the position, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly stumbling with his feet in a normal state, then you will not submit unfair accusations when you see stumbling with his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceitful verbal and non-verbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of fraud.
Cheaters can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, tend to the outlet, change their posture in a certain way or show "relief after interview" - this exaggerated breath of relief and posture change when all the complex questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the sign of the end of the interrogation to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson resigned and used the past time claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searches throughout the country.
Spraying people can also use distancing in speech: “I didn’t have sex with this woman...Miss Levinsky” or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are hardly captured.
Someone can use the “qualification language” when answering a complex question: “Good... in truth... as much as I know... as much as I know.”
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic way to detect a lie, but you can master the ability to detect fraud.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming the victim of skilled bullshit in professional and personal life.
The controversial oil pipeline plan needs revision after the U.S. threat to postpone its approval
A few days later, after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico – causing the anger of trade unions but calming environmental defenders – the company, which is planning to build the oil pipeline, claims that it will delightfully review the project to resume the work on it.
TransCanada on Monday evening that it will save the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Mountains in Nebraska and is sure that the project will still get approval.
The company said this decision at a press conference in the capital of the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, says that the company remains confident that it will finally get approval on the pipeline, though with a different route.
This occurs after the State Department announced last week that it will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Sand Mountains of Nebraska and the Ogalala aquarium, a huge underground water reserve.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental examination ordered by the State Department is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the election next year, although the authorities denied that the decision was interfering with the policy.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision an appeal from the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to shift 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to oil plants in Texas.
To do this, he must cross six states.
It is hated by environmental defenders, but loved by trade unions that hope for approximately 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, opposed to the plan, are considering the bill to accelerate the movement from the area of the Sand Mountains and the Ogalala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s recent study of environmental impacts showed that the project will only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the Department’s auditor ordered a separate examination of the examination procedure, focusing on two issues.
One - if the lobbyist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a counselor in the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether the choice of the company that was hired to conduct the initial research was inappropriate as it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty Labell was sentenced to court for allegedly causing child anger from fear.
A family from New York says the disko-diva Patty Labell began to bush in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scared their younger daughter to the extent that it was stumbled by fear.
"Lady Marmalade's tirade scared the 18-month Geneva Monk so strongly that she suffered "personality change, sleep disorder" and "a strong fear of strangers," her family said at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on November 10, last year, when the work scene Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten educator, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to go on a family journey.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on the Riverside bulvar with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter to the floor for a minute.
“Somebody came to me behind and said, ‘You know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to take her,’ she said.
Label angry made a excuse to a pregnant woman.
“She aggressively said, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter next to the door,’ Rosanna Monk said.
“I said to her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’
She came into anger and began to use anger—the word on C and the word on F—on elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she began to throw water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had begun a hysteric.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done with my daughter,’ the child’s mother said.
Label drove on her mother—who still kept Geneva—and her companions had to hold her and get into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she was angry, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter to Label with apologies but did not get a reply.
The lawyer and representatives of Label do not respond to the calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not, but family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money he receives for charity to children with cancer.
“The goal is to force Patti Labell to be responsible for his actions,” Davis said.
"That behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten educator with a 18-month child on his hands."
Climate problems slow the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign financing decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011 - the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as associated with the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called the year of change that gave rise to the economic development, but, given the unfavourable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February not only resulted in millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the possibilities of growth of the state economy, causing a 3.6 percent decline in economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic 31.16 percent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the Cold-affected areas report provided by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline of economic activity caused, until November, the constant growth of unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters was recorded accelerated growth of unemployment, from January to March 55.053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, the share, which in the number of people is more than 74.000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18.969 per cent more than the first half.
Reduction of liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year discussed by many factors, for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, by the actions that took place in public policy.
“What we see now is an increase in unemployment that is associated with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted in Congress to fight money laundering, as people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with them, invest and use them in something,” he said.
suspended immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the U.S. was limited, first due to difficulties with entrance, and in the second – since, once entering, they are already facing very many difficulties in search of work, so that a group of people remains and requires jobs here, in the state, resulting in an increase in unemployment,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market becomes worse if we pay attention to a large number of violations that prevail in the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state is working, without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularity, another reminder of work in the state is presented with low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the workers of Sinaloa was until September 5,352 pesos, much below the country average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of PI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011 was recorded the largest flow of foreign direct investments in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the state’s PII was $630.697 which shows a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $5.143.312 during the same period last year.
On its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded just 17,280,000 pesos of investments during the year, which mainly came to companies from the service sector.
The debt
On the background of the economic decline, the state government requested in July during the state congress approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level was approved only 2,600 million pesos, and until November the debt benefits were not expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government Mario Lopez Valdes demonstrates a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, chairman of the National Chamber of Processing Industry, said that in the course of 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to do a lot to return the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to harmonize the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
slowdown of the economy
Lopez Loredo said events like early frozen this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"Low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including the cold, one of the main effects was a slow economy that doesn't become fast enough to create economic dynamics that allows to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close it below our expectations," he said.
Review of direction
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said that the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we found that we worked on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will re-definit the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The upcoming work
President Coparmex emphasized the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in different fields, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is getting into work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware of much more to do,” he said.
He was sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day income penalty - such a sentence was sentenced to a Navolato citizen for keeping eight kilograms of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor's Office that the convicted drug trader - Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, in this case storing marijuana in order to spread.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican army on June 7, 2010 during the patrol of the Cypriano Valdes Street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug trader was driving a white car pickup, in which he wore a black bag in the car box, and on the passenger seat a small suitcase, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the kidnapping was transferred to the second district court, and the accused continues to be imprisoned in the Center for the Support of Legal Consequences of Crime.
You need to make contributions to work.
Public work related to programs such as Homeland, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants risks to remain unfinished or long delayed due to the lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although the work programs have continued to develop, they are in danger as the state government is unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programs.
He noted that the total funding of all three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state must contribute 25 percent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality provided resources for work, so it is still possible to delay with their completion.
“They had to invest 12 million, and although the year is over, they didn’t give us any copies, when from the beginning of July they had to give us part,” he said, “to not delay, we started work and they went very forward, but we need money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the rule of Hessus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that it had to make, so at the beginning of the term of rule the municipality had to take the money to cover more than 7 million, the amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to develop, and this year to get access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what remains to the state," he explained.
Although the state authorities are obliged to carry out the delivery of these resources, he says that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interests related to them came as quickly as possible.
“They have to make almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they don’t give us any cash.”
The court approves the "transition to digital television" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has achieved in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which carries the so-called "transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes were not collected necessary for its cancellation.
A minority of the four ministers, including the Court Chairman, Juan Silva Mesa, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree with a detailed description of the actions for the transition to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims stated by the Senate were rejected due to the absence of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to declare on the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television program is the right established by the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only El Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
According to this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives conducted two constitutional trials to deny the decree and support complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
The meeting also decided to reject the Demand of the House of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he disagrees with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive authority cannot determine by general rules the measures to which the state administration should prepare.
"I also don't think that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and reminded that the planning of state policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is related to the federal executive authority, which has a constitutional mandate, governance by the state.
The replacement of analog signals for digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
The delay of the transition, he said, would mean the delay of the benefit from the transformation into a digital form, which includes the satisfaction of public needs, which has not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he said, “require the work of the entire system formed on the principle of state economic management, including a group of powers that the Constitution unites into the state executive power.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done this with the help of the executive authorities, despite the presence of specialized technical facilities.
From this it cannot be concluded that the government, by adopting the decree which is discussed, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere the compliance of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacan, we analyze the possibility of counting "voice for voice"
According to the data transmitted to the PPRV, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes, coming to 879 out of the total number in 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is real as regards the election process this year in Michoacan, where, according to the data obtained from the Program for Pre-Voting Results (PPRV), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes coming to 879 out of the total number in 6.074 protocols.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoacan Election Institute (IMM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Zaragoza, reminded that a few days ago, November 9, the electoral body approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
As it should be remembered, Michoacan did not accept the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legitimate deadline of their entry into force in this election process and Governor Leonel Gody Rangel did not include its publication within the deadlines specified in the law in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he has some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (High Court of Justice) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim made by the local legislative assembly, and called the vote of a representative of the state on the constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "accept or support them."
In an interview on the possibility of "vote by vote" Maria de los Angeles Lianderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate principles by the General Council of the IMM will be possible to submit a partial or full number of votes by the local electoral body.
So, a partial recalculation of one or more voting urns can be made under the conditions that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no voting and accounting protocol in the urn or it is not in the presidential office; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the total number of votes in all urns at the elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the supposed candidate-winner of the elections in question and the one who won the second place in voting is less or equal to one percentage, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the mentioned candidates.
A total number of votes shall also be made if at the end of the ordinary number is stated that the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is less or equal to one percentage, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has second-place candidate, in the event that the electoral urns that were taken into account at the partial number are excluded.
It is worth noting that in this situation are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, even without counting 129 votes from the total number in 923 protocols.
His last will
His dust will be spread in the mountains of Saphaliname, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltilio, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, a inspection and a peaceful mess was held.
According to the family, the ultimate will of the subcomandant was that his dust was dispersed in the mountains of Saphaliname.
After accepting condolences with the other people who died in the crash, the family of Basio Cortesa returned to the capital of Coaula on board the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people visited the ceremony in Campo Mart.
In the afternoon, the poll of the Colonel arrived in the clock located on the bulvar of Nazario Ortis Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m. afternoon he passed an examination of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former classmates at the high school and the football team, a member of which was Felipe Basio during his secondary school training.
“His desire was to return to Saltiello, and to make his dust spread in the mountains of Saphaliname, he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot’s sister.
According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes he was at the peak of her life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, dedicated to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio very young left the city of Saltilio to enter the College of Aviation in Sapopane, Khalisco.
Some didn’t believe him, they said he had a head round even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His grandson Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltilio, the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltilio."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan for a ceremony of awarding his relative's diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he most loved in life: driving a plane.
They lead him to the last path.
The arms were shot in honor of the Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, the leaders and students of the Technical High School in Saltilio, in which he studied in 1985 and made successes both in the study and in the sport, conducted it in the last way.
Basio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he managed crashed, along with the Secretary of the Government of the province, José Francisco Blake Morey, and six others, all the representatives of the ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortes (cremated), the resident of Saltilio, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office to members of the Mexican Air Force headed by Major James Martinez, on the crew of a training school where he was already waiting for his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teacher.
Three bodies found thrown on the farm of N.L. Kadereita
A few hours before the discovery, military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at the abandoned farm in the municipality of Kaderita Himenes, Nuevo León.
The find was found on 1.5 km of the Kadereita highway towards Santiago, at an altitude in the municipality known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed the door noticed that in the village house, the wall of which was painted in beige and brown, the door was tightly opened.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately gave it to the relevant authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white mother.
Almost one meter away was the body of another man, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
The three were all on the face down.
According to the evidence that was collected there, three people were killed elsewhere because there was no gills on the site.
On the hole of the village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group another, also in it and in the gates there are several holes from the bullets.
11 captured in Caterpillar
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, which operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereita, and who are accused of kidnapping, murders, "fraud" and secret burials.
On November 11th, eight people were arrested in the Los Alvores colony, and one man who was hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a phone calling for membership in a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event occurred on November 12, at 6:00 a.m., when military personnel carried out a patrol ride in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereite, when they saw a car without the number signs with two men in the salon.
After stopping them and conducting the inspection, the military found a wing, a patrol and 18 patrol.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00 one of their co-workers was stopped on the public land of La Prava, who, seeing the soldiers, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face the crisis that put the country on the edge of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new government that will face the crisis that put Italy at the edge of an economic catastrophe and damaged the entire euro area.
A statement from the presidential palace said that Monty, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Georgi Napolitano to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet consisting mainly of technocrates, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the president the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti didn’t say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles were overcome.
“The structure is now well drawn up,” he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual as Italy faced the political and financial crisis that brought the size of their debt to a critical level.
The administration under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty must approve the rigorous savings package required by European leaders to restore trust in Italy.
Based on the pressure on Monty to hurry, the unstable markets set the income from the BTP bonds of Italy for 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monty: "We said we will actively support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monty’s efforts must lead to a good outcome,” said Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the central-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government’s majority, consisting of the technocrates, which forms Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular hard-saving reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure, warning that Monty’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish the series of meetings on Tuesday evening.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi will resign, the value of Italy’s debt has now reached a critical level in the background of uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
The rescue of Italy with a government debt of €1.8 billion would be too much for the modern financial defenders of the euro area.
Monty said his government would exist until the next 2013 elections, despite the widespread forecasts that politicians will only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should only be composed of technical experts, a proof of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources that mutual uncertainty and disagreement of the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish has more game experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, if compared 22 players invited by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a day at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in the monthly FIFA ranking, have a whole list of A-class match games, Tricolor has only the defendant Michael Uman as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and in the strong Premier League clubs were very active during this year in the league and in local cup competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
To this, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish furia in the difficult qualification in the Euro or World Championship.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list in the Spanish team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Heavi Hernandez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Havi were recognised as the best of the UEFA last week along with the other player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Shalke bomber Raoul Gonzales with 102.
Nearly approaching to the hundred, Charles Puyol with 97 games.
Havie Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Inesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, the left side Junior Diaz with 48 matches and the bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Further, only five overcome the boundary in 30 games: Keylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The remaining.
More than 30 matches in Spain with Gerar Pike (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santiago de Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbelloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 outcomes there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest did not reach even 20.
While Nacho Morale has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two games, and Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country in tour in honor of twenty years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of expectation, but the group says that for them it is also a dream that has become reality – playing in this country.
This was the statement of the basist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the territory of South America as part of a tour in honor of twenty years of work and on Sunday, 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
This day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is a breakthrough from the conversation, the full decryption of which is available online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans this is a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream for us too.
This is our only second visit to South and Central America, and for now everything is going well.
I’ve been in Costa Rica only once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country, and I think we’ll be able to stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I’m asking about it because there’s some commitment to the group; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most dedicated fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some stress to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have occurred over the past two weeks.
We held a few great shows in San Paolo and we hope that it has brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle as regards these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always travel surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua as well as to Mexico, these are great places for surfing, this is how we learned about it from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you’ve made a great show with a lot of songs.
What do you plan for your performance in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no limitations on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with the most diverse songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans the great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does it happen?
I think this is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs that we didn’t play for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour will celebrate 20 years of your career.
Looking back, it’s hard to believe everything you’ve done.
Yes of course.
First, I think no one of us could ever imagine we’re going to be in a rock band and what we’re doing this for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are happy with our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are happy to travel in places in the world where we always wanted to go.
For us, everything goes very well.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the growth of the grange?
It has always been a honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with boys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s good when the movement grows from a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time there is one group from one city, but it’s far more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and proud to be a part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we’re happy to be friends with all of them and for us a honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that succeeded.
It is also strange that a group like yours remains together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we are lucky that we are still alive, and second, we take care of others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, we have also opened musical roads that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and everything could not be better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be too long in the tour because it’s easy to get into this game of large crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what has done it, not deciding to be famous and rock star, that one of us is not seriously concerned about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we wrote really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We have been a band for almost three years and have not released any album until Andy (Andrew Woods) has died.
There was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmor) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think of the incredible man who Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a great man and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
It’s true that you’re familiar with her work, especially Eddy Vedder, and that’s why you’ve chosen her to discover?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video suggestions, and it was a group that liked us most of all, so we will not be able to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It’s a question to Eddy (Eddy Weder), so I don’t know.
He sings her and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
They are so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Heather Butler, John Antwissle, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Duckowski ...
They are so many that I can talk all day about the basists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grange relevant despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel some distraction from the word grange.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it’s important now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening, and teams like Mudhoney are now creating music better than ever.
In the beginning your music was more dark, and now it has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
From both, when Ed played them, I was crying, when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or a friend, these events begin to influence your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still know how to create dark music.
of Peru:
Fuchimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Former President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a state hospital for an examination of the subject of loss of muscle strength that is observed in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fuhimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his opinion, Fuhimori should be a candidate for the good of mercy for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he does not want it because he knows that he is innocent.
He passed four surgery for tongue cancer, lost 18 pounds, which was added to other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people by the destruction forces of the army, which acted secretly in the first years of his rule.
Mukhika goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by President of Uruguay José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political issues of the region.
Mukhika will meet on Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "beneficial for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations," the South American country's leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Mukhika is seeking support for Calderon for Uruguay in the incident with France that happened when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the tax sheet of the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havans, a statement that caused Uruguay's protest and a refusal for consultations with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the chairman of the G20 since November, a group formed from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, a deal with the South American country since January of this year on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The government of Uruguay has been trying in recent years to accelerate the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to leave this "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which increased the trade between the two countries.
The water pipeline will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has continuously fought for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the bad legs of Bouser, but never before he did this in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the features of the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell how the stereoscopy without glasses will work," Nintendo's head of the press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, said during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially developed under this platform," because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing games.
Nintendo said that despite the existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once starting, most experts will go "to the second round" on the levels of the game, which this time more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but on which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "do not be subject to optical illusions".
This Super Mario invasion in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game Nintendo turns the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, the waterproof with his ears must pass through dangerous mined platforms to release Princess Pitch.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "player" Luigi.
Kolom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo began to respond in the United States for a conspiracy on $70 million laundering.
This ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of a northern country that demanded the extradition of Portillo to be judged there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision is related to the independence of judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the court of first instance has already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he did not "pick his hands" to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious body injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug sale.
What Colom did shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted in order to persecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the rulings of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Portillo will be extradited once with a ruling on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was declared innocent in the Q120 million loss in the Ministry of Defense during the presidential term, which was a process preceding the extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and opened the case again.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation have helped overcome difficult situations over this quarter of the century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary served as an occasion for the results at the ceremony held in the room of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared next to Trinitate Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or subject to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been working with the association for these 25 years.
Different political representation during the elections showed the unified character of the work done by Trinijove.
After the Chairman of the Generality, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordy Puhol, the ceremony was attended by the former Adviser of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former Mayor and current ecosocialist, a member of the Municipal Council, Richard Goma.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats the current consultant on social welfare and family issues, José Luis Cléris and La Caixa Social Work Directorate, Huume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove appeared in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
The Chairman brought Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the universe of hope in people experiencing difficulties.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work it has done,” he said.
The building where mass parties were organized was evacuated.
Thieves occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on the Balmes Street, 51
12 occupants left the building on Wednesday afternoon without struggle
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in the house 51 on the Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbors, according to a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the castle on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From this moment there will be passing control here,” the manager said.
The squatters, which captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest settled, took all the electricity and part of the water, drawn the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially banks from under-alcoholic drinks.
The first three floors were a place for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a night club, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80%.
The club’s owner says the building’s invaders pulled her into an unfair competition as they sold drinks for three euros, while the club for 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the disco had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors on noise, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by the club visitors, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, those who attended the parties they organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as said angry neighbors.
The club owner said the discomfort was so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner, and it’s been nine months since he’s “forgiving” her the rental payment.
The city police also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbors over the situation in the past few weeks.
PP’s Chairman, Adviser Alberto Fernand Diaz, called on last week to “immediately evacuate the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that appeared in the neighbors, and degradation in this area.”
The popular leader explained that until summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them have occurred crashes.
In this sense, he added that it is “necessary to put an end to impunity and persistently resist the impunity that is created in the building.”
Police evacuated the building in New Barris.
At 15:30 the police went out to the street Montreal, 35 after receiving a call from the neighbor who noticed that four people entered the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
Architects agree to the possibility of the contest after the provision of contributions
Municipal 16 doors competition renews debate on Colserola's role in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80s, at the rise of the now extinct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotions for Colserola.
Bucklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987, the park again took a place in the mind of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not to the north-south, but to the upper (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild caban in the role of the bear of Yoga.
This was so until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions on many other doors in Colserol.
Under the gates the idea of the park is understood, without a doubt.
Or someone wants to put the door to the field.
The question is one: Colserola, a park or a mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are a topic to discuss all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repeated topic that is discussed when two members of this tribe of elected people meet each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: Competition suitable
For Roldan, after achieving the coastal line, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, the mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“We need to admit that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Moreover, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserola is more complicated," says the architect, for whom the title "Colserola Gate" contains a "slavic hole": we should not think of them "as the entrance to the park, but as the limitation of some zones where we should act."
Modelo, like Roland and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
The risks arise due to the "uncertainty of the forecasting of public space" after the 80's experience, which ended at the Forum's "sweeping song" site.
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where it is possible to build.
“Limiting something is preparing the next step,” means the transition.
“We need to think about the new urban planning instruments because the current [with regard to the General Capital Plan] can lead to real trouble.”
More close to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo reminds that there is already a work done outside of Calserola, which "there should not be missed by the ears", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his profession to join this project "from the very beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubt" whether this technical profile is what should be led by interdisciplinary teams ("success," he claims), which should have been created: "Architects should be only a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, as the rules of the competition lack the general type of Colserola: "16 crossing competitions have been announced, he says, in the sense of sea-mountains, but there is no readable reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This requires, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one doors can cross the program and definition with the architect’s project for the neighboring doors.
From your point of view, the council is determined to ensure that the strip directly above Ronda de Dalt should provide in its fullness the area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasaball and he will be released
After 72 days of settlements, Red Casino’s court representative forgived Monterrey’s brother in a trial against him on charges of raping.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino gave him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which leads the prosecution against the brother of the mayor of Montreal.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gill Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where allegedly Manuel Jonas asked him to pay an economic contribution so that the authorities of Montreal allowed a secret operation in the gambling house.
After public conviction, the State Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and sent to prison for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed in this place for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order on the ban of movement after the prosecutor excluded the crimes of the seizure and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Kadereita allegedly for the kidnapping of a half-million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation the proof of Jonass's guilt was quite obvious, such as taking 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmakers in exchange for the permission of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before judge José Luis Pessina to ask for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region so that in the next hours he could get free.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he compensated the damage and who of the gambling house’s partners gave mercy, although the lawyer tried not to sound the name.
Based on the record 197/2011, the lawful mercy was granted to Jonas Larrazaba, and after that no declarations about the proceedings that were planned against him will be made; also no compensation for damages and punishment will be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrasaball Bretton.
The court official, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicolas municipality prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case will be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Perez Hakoome tells the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francesco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) that the results obtained in the accident in which the Minister of Internal Affairs Francesco Black Mora and seven other people were killed showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot's attempt to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Communications and Transport Minister Dionisio Peres Hakoome said that before the aircraft climbed up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the device lost fluctuation."
He also said the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it meets the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the attack area do not report the presence of particles on the ground.
"The study reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, the attack occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which meets the corresponding requirements of passenger transportation.
The earth in this place has a curve from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study can take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Chief Executive Officer of Airports and Assistance Services, said that during the attack the presidential helicopter was driven at a cruise speed and that it happened on a soft rising ground.
“This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of the attack,” he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hackome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
The weather conditions:
AICM reports found appropriate conditions for landing when the aircraft headed to the border area between the city of Mexico and the state of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low heights.
Selected routes:
Per because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of less height and greater visibility in the Kuernawak Valley.
Place of Strike.
The strike coordinates and the last record from the aircraft's radar coincide, probably before the strike there was no loss of control or change of flight direction.
Distribution of breaks on a small area:
The information still available indicates that the blow came to the front and side lines.
The fragmentation of the breaks makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the earth in the conditions of structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the zone of the disaster remains uncovered evidence in the vessels of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there could be multiple contacts with the earth.
During the work on the site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a curve from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it was destroyed on the way.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter could have had several collisions with the ground.
Following a thorough investigation on a larger area than the covered area near the place where the disaster occurred, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the attack occurred under the conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces obesity gen search program
Social protection leads the study on the search for the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by experts from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which was named the Protocol "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence", which will provide a list of signs associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Department of medical research in the field of biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers was gathered.
This team is supported by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of National Health (NIPH) and the Center for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (recommended or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m., children will be tested.
He emphasized that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Kuala Lumpur (west of Mexico), and since October 8 the events are held at the sports center in Nassaualkoyotle (east of Mexico).
After the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children will be achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
The World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14th and the main objective is to gather 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 with the permission of their parents and under their supervision to complete individual nutritional surveys.
They are also asked about physical activity and history of family hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He explained that on Saturday will be carried out anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, growth and range of the belt), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify the genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that this study reflects the concerns of health professionals about an alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that in just 6 years there was an increase: in boys 77 percent suffered obesity, in girls 47 percent; in terms of overweight, there was also a significant increase,” said MSSI specialist.
He said that the reasonability of searching for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He that the average Mexican is 65 percent descendant of American Indians, 30 percent descendant of Europeans and 5 percent descendant of Africans and this condition affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly the consequence of obesity genetics is the incapacity of the body to burn the excess of energy we consume (calories), and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can determine whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark clusters on the neck (acts) and forearms means the probability of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is processed with all confidentiality, the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that should be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruise Lopez explained that there are three main causes that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of TV and using transport on small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (thamals, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid fractures
Rafael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, has developed a polymer-modified bitum to produce the best quality, environmental and temperature-resistant mixture.
If the signals sent by the road cover were paid attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand hams for every rain season in the capital area in the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Errera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical faculty, and adds that if the process of building and keeping the asphalted road cover is correct, the number of hams can be reduced or completely reduced to zero.
In his lecture Technical Look at the Hole, read in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is that the laboratory, for which it is responsible, develops a polymer-modified bitum to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitum, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitum can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of the roads and, therefore, to counter the formation of jams.
He explained that bitum, the heavest part of oil, is a sequence of carbohydrate molecules, some of which are high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others are low molecular mass called maltens, which together give the road cover its characteristic wise-thinking behavior.
The vibrant behavior of the bitum consists in the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a fluid, at 120 its vibration is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitum becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the street asphalt resistance is not constant, but changes over the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, a chemical engineering specialist said.
The scientist of Hymfak noted that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered with a flexible cover, which consists of six layers of material, of which the last three include bitum.
Among the top layers is a bitum composed of small stones left into bitum and then pressed.
Every stone that makes this cover, he said, is immersed in a bitum.
When driving vehicles and making efforts, this helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road cover.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, placed the last layer, which is called a layer of drainage, which is made of small stone, actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is the layer that will contact the wheels of transportation, it should have greater resistance than the asphalt cover and provide road treating.
As part of the road cover, which will receive and spread these efforts, the drain layer also requires the appropriate thickness, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially moisture and temperature shifts, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the earth is raw, the water penetrates into the cover and it is difficult to get out there, it causes the dilution of all layers of the cover and, therefore, the formation of hips.
During the formation of jams, he said, the first layer is drawn out and only then it affects the bitum, but the damage does not occur instantly, this is a process that should be paid attention at the first signs of the current repair programs.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of cover should always be linked to the transport load and it is necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement to prevent the frequent appearance of holes.
Rafael Errera said that relatively bitum much is still to be studied and done, for example, bitum emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to make the caves with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was not enough for the candidate from Vallée to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Melina Ramirez from getting the Crown of Miss Colombia.
Valerie has been awarded the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca only wanted to win the Crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be pleased with getting on the winners podium with a silver crown and a tape declaring her the new Princess of Colombia.
Given the outcome achieved last evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the squadron, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown but were announced by princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsaate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Monica Everes (1989), Sonia Piadone (1990), Iberia Diane (1993), Alleghua Garcia (2008), Alleghua Garcia (2008), Alleghua Garcia (2008), Alleghua Garcia (2008).
The question many asks now:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favourite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen as the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Person in Vogue version - the titles that Queen owned, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalya Navarro, who received the Crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she couldn't convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?", asked by Martin Muriel Gomez from the literary society Let's read.
She answered the questioning:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of oculture, and I definitely believe that the book that characterizes my childhood – The Little Prince – is a pretty deep book.
Today I read Crime and Punishment, this masterpiece of world literature that we all should read; also at this moment I read the book of Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a miraculous book entitled The Heat of Blood.
The answer that the jury didn’t like because of the term “oculture” and, secondly, because it didn’t explain specifically how each of the book quoted it characterizes.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with her outcome: "The universe is wise, what is going to happen is happening."
And you all, please read at least a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the so-called hypotheses, Vallée burned from favourism.
The reporter from Bogota suggested that, as she was preferred, she was encountered with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's cooking competition, the audience voting for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which raised the jealousy of other candidates, provoked the stress of the queen, and as a result she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noticed during her first appearance in the bathroom on Hilton Beach and during her two shows on the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed.
Ariel Osorio, the journalist of the "How Home" program on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess, "makes that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition doesn't become a queen."
In addition, the representative Valerie recently avoided communication with the press and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative Valerie failed to try to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, a member of the international jury, Lucy Dottie said they’re looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must not only look at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in projects,” she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative Valerie was wrong with defects on the bacteria and fibrosis that was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial as the jury noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
King's consultant Jorge Hernan Orosco notes that Melina didn't have the best body, which was better, "but the problems of fibrosis on the stomach, which were not very noticeable for me, forced her to lose glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos from the Kromos magazine believes that Valerie de Cauca’s mistake was that she was undergoing a surgical intervention.
“Operations are good, but the representative Valerie doesn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was awarded for the first time by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel forecast was fulfilled last night, they say that it was the dealer that Raymond gave Melina as a compensation for her losing the pleasure of getting the crown.
So or not, it is the fact that today Melina begins the year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions, specified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will come into history as one of the kings who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Carthage, faced difficulties in getting the crown.
This was the work of the man who discovered the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali criminal has entered history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4 Criminalist CTI Kali came into history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working in the CTI, this week was the turn to “dejection” Elizabeth Gonzales, a man from Puerto Texas who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzales worked in the towns of Choko, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Vallée and after completing the corresponding courses he became a specialist in the field of criminalism, where he studied the thresholds of the skin, i.e. the arms and the wings.
During the week of Elizabeth's operation to identify a person known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something great approached.
On Friday night he arrived on a helicopter from Kauk to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the footprints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with a group of researchers at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it in its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much worse.
But the footprints are not drawn.
Using an enlarge glass, a brick, a thumb and a lighthouse, Elizabeth compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the pictures.
His eyes did not fool: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm the Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the SSC.
Search for fingerprints
For the Daktiloscopy Specialist of the Sijin Division of Kali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos by Elizabeth Gonzales at a press conference on the operation against Cano is significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Daktiloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, doctrinists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and identify the prisoners.
When detained, many criminals have false certificates or do not have documents.
We take their footprints and look for them in the base.
The researcher said that in case of theft he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in that place the thief stood with his hands to possess a safe, full of precious things and money.
“It’s hard to work with the walls because they’re not convenient surfaces for removing footprints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole hand and find the identity of the criminal who took part in several theft,” he said.
The footprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man with bottles was found from the lake around him.
In the course of the investigation it was found that a relative could be suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the place of murder.
A Dactyloscopy specialist from the CTI explained that chemical or physical reactors are applied to the places where there are footprints.
When they appear, a tape or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the footprints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered in the register.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” CTI’s expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch leaves footprints on you.
However, if possible, the comparison is made.
“The Angry People” challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke the camp in front of Zukotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court’s decision to remove the demonstration from the square and went to the park nearby.
The Wall Street capture movement called on the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to again penetrate, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at the sunlight in an attempt to capture another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near the Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allowed "an angry people" to break the camp on the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the breakdown, capturing the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out.
“Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break down the camp on the square, we will break down the camp somewhere else and continue the court struggle for the return to Zukotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations,” said Mark Brey.
Bray explained that the response of the "righteous people" to the evacuation of the palace town, which was ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg personally, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling prohibiting the violent evacuation from the square and allowing the demonstrants to stay in the camp.
Furious people also began to capture a new park located on the site of the fusion of the central streets of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could take that place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Brey couldn’t name the exact number, but Efe said he saw a few journalists who were also in the handle.
The organization assures that several hundred people stood with the tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support to the members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in talks with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti square, which is a private property, remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will consider the legality of today's morning displacement of protesters.
Some of the protesters that went there carried and distributed at the same time copies of that court ruling and even gave these copies to the police who protected the square, which led to "some small collisions," said Brey, who said that some police battle the protesters.
The court ruling prohibits the authorities to carry out the evacuation of members of the Wall Street Movement and to force to “the laws that were issued after the beginning of the capture, or to prohibit the protesters from regaining access to the park with shops and other property used before.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that due to this court ruling the city suspended the opening of public space and the protesters were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to reboot chamber shops and bed bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of the protesters from the Zukotti square, the operation carried out in the morning, during which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was taken because the protesters "broken the law."
Bloomberg said he gave an order to clean the square as it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to hurt other people," as "some were threatened" and neighbors feared "of the deterioration of the quality of life."
The evacuation, held this morning, was disgusting and shows that in the depths of the heart Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers,” a spokesman added, who condemns the mayor for “disrespect of freedom of speech.”
Responsible for the Wall Street capture also stated that they intend to organize “grand action” on Thursday in cooperation with public organizations and trade unions to remind the last two months of the protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear in the TV show "Christmas of Rossell Peters" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Big Repair", the rescue in "Salvators of Malibu", Banny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian TV.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the crooner (executive of ballads) Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, will appear in the TV program "Christmas of Rossell Peters" on December 1, in the role of a completely special Mary.
CTV presented today the images of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widely distributed on the internet home porn video, where she appears along with her then still husband, the bubble band "Mötley Crüe" Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary, holding in the eyelids a doll that depicts Jesus.
In this scene, Peter, the famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently appeared as the leader in the tour "My brutal torpedo of truth" by Charlie Shane, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show of CTV is attended by Canadian singer Bubble, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires to the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot of scandals.

Japan resurrected after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and put an end to the drop that began in March.
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still managed by a devastating earthquake that caused the nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe carried by the country of the rising sun since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, material losses amounted to $300,000 million – a blow that, despite the severe global situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive quarters, GDP data from July to September helped turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annual calculations.
Registered in the second quarter, - for Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
The resurrection may be partially explained by the resurrection of the purchase of machinery to restore areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% decrease in capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen – or rebuild – the infrastructure using the breach to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened, mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% due to an increase in costs for cars, travel and leisure.
Claymo Yeny
Tokyo has provided the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “asylum currencies” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro zone and negative forecasts toward the United States, a privilege that will press, like a stone, on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame yen in its low rates from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to shake the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Esihiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be attentive to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, economic policy minister Motohis Furukova said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that most member countries showed clear signs of decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts breakthroughs in the world economy has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
He then fell by four decades to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even fallen below the average level of 100 points after it collapsed by eight ten points to 99.13 points.
Athens are giving ground to doubt.
Papadimos said the correction will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment.
With peripheral risks and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to blur in the labyrinth that leads to a way out of the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "acceptance" of the new transitional government of Elada is imposed by Brussels' demands rather than by the true belief of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one-day period agreed at his appointment may be insufficient for their implementation, the conservative party leader "New Democracy" Antones Samaras assures that he will not support new measures of strict savings in any case and repeated his demand for new elections appointed on February 19.
The main task of this government is to fulfill the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be celebrated tomorrow with a vote of trust to the new executive authority.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, the reforms of the disciplinary code of public employees and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clear doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything."
The leader of the conservatives made a step more in his mood towards the EU and the IMF, organizations that are to freeze 8,000 million that are urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect caused by the statements of the Papandreou referendum in the style of everything or nothing, repeated yesterday that its demands are unclear: it will not renew aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties of Greece do not sign "a written agreement without any doubts and as soon as possible."
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeus Altafai, said the inspectors of the Trojan could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth trance" in the amount of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been specified.
In the Greek club, it will be enough for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: “These are the tools of progress and hope”
The Queen emphasized Spain's "basic" place in terms of this type of finance
Spain has "taught a visible place in the world in the field of microfinancing."
Queen Sofia reminded that the country has become the second largest donor in the past two decades in terms of cooperation instruments, whose “essence,” she said, is that it is “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future of all mankind, based on faith in people.”
The Queen opened the Fifth World Micro-Credit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "completely necessary" to the Millennium goals set by the United Nations for 2015 and "especially aiming to double the number of people living less than one dollar a day, a level on which the "chart of poverty" is recorded.
Spain is still working to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes this task with all its "responsibility," says Donna Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements arising during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "assure the creation of new capabilities and best opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main recipients of these gifts."
There are “a lot of achievements” and “a lot of difficulties we face.”
The Micro-Credit Summit becomes not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and a hundred million of these households will be removed from the poverty they are immersed in.
The impulse to the creation of a micro-credit system in Spain and the rest of the world "goed the way started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, said Sofia, as "a act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this tool as a "immensive idealist in the general affairs of poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years since the queen went to Bangladesh to study on the site his loan policy.
This experience year later took over the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those that took place in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "allwhere I saw continuous development," said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project brought her yesterday the title of "heads of the family", gathered in Valladolid "the poor bankers".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished the speech, calling on the present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Chimenes said solidarity is a "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent commitment."
Chimenes concluded that micro-crediting implies a "serious and solid course to eradicate poverty" and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries should work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of expenditure cuts.
For Spain, micro-credit is "one of the main directions of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraia Rodriguez, highly appreciated the "success" in giving "confidence" to the people "shared, before whom all the doors are closed", and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all the presents in the city, who "opens its doors covered by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the chairman of the European Commission by general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program, but it emerged in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is far from as strict as it follows, today towards Greece and tomorrow towards Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, presented for discussion by the leadership, was approved almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten refused to vote.
The staying ovation, which lasted a few minutes, which merited Angela Merkel's speeches and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile and the finance minister, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the true response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For Chancellor, it is time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that enable the European Union to strengthen control over the financial policy of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote "to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; the UK is against it, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
The soil is prepared.
Similarly, the delegates with an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to raise the vote of each EU member country under the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cole, but she did not seek to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficult situations who like to criticize "high" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe a whole paragraph is dedicated to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Only by passage.
Remember that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud with hospital leaves?
Following monetary grants, the UMP and the government started an attack on hospital letters.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Aid Distribution Fund and speak with a speech on this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on the fight against fraud in the field of social benefits.
And to help this attack, arising from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also a part of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on hospital leaves.
First of all, with regard to budget savings, the government intends to impose on private companies workers the fourth day of unpaid leave before the start of the payment of the benefits.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose a salary in four days equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to raise a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to a saving of €280 million.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, i.e. to impose on government officials one day without the payment of disease benefits (state officials have not yet had to wait for the payment of benefits, unlike the three-day expectation from the workers of the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, the majority also again raises the topic of fraud, having regard to abuse when issuing hospital letters.
The control will be harder and add-ons, if you are captured, you will have to return all the payments you have received illegally,” Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate with the actual abuse of hospital leaves.
They have been under constant control and political attacks since 2002, which have brought their fruits.
People in France are sick not more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s first look at the numbers by country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros and was 5% of the total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% applied to decreet holidays and accidents at work and 54% to health benefits, which amounted to 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore, it accounted for 2.5 percent of the health-related expenditure.
French people spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
A medium arithmetic that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French employees said they did not take a single day of hospital.
Another study, this time related to health insurance, says that in 2010 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with the figures of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are not more likely to take the hospital than workers of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001 the total shortage of unemployment in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The scam level associated with hospital leaves is very low compared to "grey" employment.
As for the scam level, it is very low.
The severity of the law after 2002 led to the systematic inspection of hospitals for a duration of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million cases tested, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 short-term diseases were “unjustified” or too long,” which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records over a period of more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is equal to 132,000.
In total, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unfounded” for several million workers receiving hospital letters.
The figures that show very few cases in comparison, for example, with the figures of "green" employment.
According to UMP Deputy Dominic Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to 9 to 15 thousand euros of unacquired budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total daily compensation costs, and therefore endlessly higher than losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was stated on Monday 14 November in parliament by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, adding that the 100 days provided to his coalition government were not enough to fulfill this task.
"To the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the head of government said, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the vote of trust in the parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "main task" of the new government, as the presence of the country in the Eurozone is "placed on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a decrease in the country’s budget deficit “approximately to 9%” from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The law rejects the measures of the new government
On Monday, the right-wing leader, Antonio Samaras, expressed his support for the already taken measures to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of strict savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party New Democracy.
He expressed his consent to the tasks of reducing deficits and debts and fighting losses, but also his dishonesty of any course that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renou, the European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU will not unlock the necessary loan of €8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties that they will support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he will not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, says the Committee of Experts
Canadians are refused to die, according to a report from the Royal Society of Canada
As for palliative medicine, the committee affirms that the government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and that without taking into account cases of cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which attended six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee proposes the government to amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow suicide with external aid and euthanasia when this choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For the beginning, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medialization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to argue on the subject of death.”
Because of medication or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end with death in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the delicate question of euthanasia and foreign aid suicide the authors of the report come to the conclusion that is contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and foreign aid suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization involves abuse in use, i.e. euthanasia or suicide with external aid against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Joshelin Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Josselin Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to the 2010 survey by Angus Reed, they believe that it will allow people to relieve their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia will not be a sign that the life of elderly or disabled people has less value.
As for people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be persecuted criminally.
As for the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less unclear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally legitimate termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in the spirit of respect to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal persecution.
As for palliative care, the committee calls on the government, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, as regards palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely applied in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to suppress physical pain like euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Observations of other experts
Some health-related legislation experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report by experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pierre Deshan, a health law expert, described as “extremity” the position of experts who signed the report, because among all other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Dešan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
He also stressed that the authors of the report appear to put the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social tissue of society.
He said that “in society there are warning signs and prohibitions.”
The health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called a “manifest for euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, in particular, the data of the report concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and foreign aid suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus condemns ‘conflict’
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria has increased, Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting him and condemns the "conflict" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan voted for the resignation of President Assad.
Jordan's King Abdullah II became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to resign from power in Syria, where more than 40 civilians and servants of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If the interests of his country were expensive for Bashar, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” Jordan’s king, a neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret over the fact that Turkish mediation efforts, which began in early this year, did not succeed.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, indicating Syria, a neighboring country against which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
The United States, on its part, welcomes the “expansion of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries like Turkey are taking a more and more harsh path towards the repressions in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime's armed forces were killed in the Dera district in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reports.
Two other inhabitants were killed during the shooting and shooting from heavy bullets in Djobar in the occupied city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
He also reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step.”
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
After its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying the mechanism of the protection of civilians and requires the abuse to the country of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also spoke for sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, according to him, fell into "paranoia".
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis-out-out plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is going, and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the decision of the League of Arab States "inappropriate" on Wednesday, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refused to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty Demands Time From Markets and Victims From Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form their team and implement a program that will require “offers” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
The former European Commissioner took part in a discussion with political parties before today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrates who are not part of the parliament.
Monty talked about the importance of the program that involves many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the prime minister candidate.
Deputy House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti will ask parliament to vote on trust until Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The meeting ends with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list of ministers from the jungle or near that to the head of the country, Georgios Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking them for time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the government and the program,” he added, adding that he is convinced that the markets will be patient and understand.”
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns emerged again, especially after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, the technocrates, although he emphasized that he would also want to include “politics.”
The new government is expected to act until 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
Deputy House spokesman Gianfranko Fini said the new government will receive a parliament's trust vote on Friday.
Mr. Monti guaranteed that he will work hard to ensure that Italy again becomes an important actor in Europe.
Representative of the European Commissioner Olli Ren emphasized that "in spite of the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not meet the budget for 2013, despite the strict savings plan adopted in recent months, has called for, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot follow the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), presents a "changing of age" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", a "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "the other Italy", according to the authors of the predecessors.
Unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid early elections, as by April 2012 Italy should make payments on government debts in the amount of 200 thousand million euros.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, the U.S. agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of this UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern over the "possible military aspect" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies significantly on the documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “from the 1960s, in the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds methods of explosion.”
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to set up a company that produces “nanomas” in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentioned “open signs that the development of Iran’s nuclear detonator system was contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well, but who also told the agency that he worked most of his career on this technology within the framework of his native country’s military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period other forms of racial and religious violence have slightly decreased or not changed.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equivalent to a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in attacks against Jews and a 14% increase in the total number of crimes on religious ground.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47,3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences.
After the decline in 2009 causes concern that the number of these crimes is growing again, the human rights organization Human Rights First emphasizes, “the increase of cases of violence against Muslims is significant,” the organization adds in a official statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that the acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate-based crimes, should be seen as serious human rights violations,” said Paul Legander.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports of hate-based crimes.”
“Hate-based crimes” in the federal law are the inheritance of a period of struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after Martin Luther King’s death to punish for acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, nationality and today’s sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the microblog site Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, what makes the service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and other “name” allow you to track more easily and directly the activity of other “Twitters”, the internet users whose messages (“Twitters”) you track, and those who track yours.
This allows you to know if they will publish messages, if they will sign up for new accounts, if they will display selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "on a small percentage of users in August" before it was broadly available throughout the network on Monday, AFP told Twitter press release Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively quite incomprehensible and as using rather unclear terms (RT for the post of someone else's temptation, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), mainly brings pleasure to experienced users, opens itself thus to a wider audience, presenting users something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation through “tweet” on the Internet.
“It’s useless, obsessive and quite like Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the "Golden Rule" of the Budget
The leadership of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to record the budget "Golden Rule" in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible downturn by the rating agencies of the state credit rating of Austria (three-A).
Chancellor-social-democrat Werner Feiman personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian government debt being 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the top threshold of 60%, established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the government debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s payability fell by only one point, from the AA to the AA+, we would have to pay interests by three thousand million euros more each year, said Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria fulfills the requirement of the Eurozone summit on October 26 in Brussels; the heads of states and governments demanded a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through the constitution or equivalent law.
The resolution, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the “German model” as Germany was the first European country to adopt the “Rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, and land, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the government debt fall below the 60% mark established by the Maastricht Treaty, by 2020/2021.
Yeshiko Noda
Threatening a new intervention in the currency market
Japan's Prime Minister Yeshiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities will carry out new interventions on the currency market if the price of the yen continues to rise.
We will interfere, as we did last time, if we calculate the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to a historic mark, which encouraged the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for a large-scale dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown continuously, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a refuge in these disturbing times of global economic decline and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency is harmful to Japanese exports as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the volume of incomes of Japanese companies from abroad when converted into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to restore itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (north-east), Mr. Noda stressed, who is afraid that this growth of yen will kill the fragile birth of recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect "the fundamental economic indicators of Japan."
Finance Minister Zyun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Managing Authority of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan has already taken “the appropriate steps” to make it clear that no additional relief should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the emitting organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 million euros), raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the roofs of the amounts it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates rise, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of infection by the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges went on Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10 a.m. CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished the deals at a level of 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties with the payment of loans by the eurozone countries, the worldwide stock markets continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Curious investors are just too worried about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker of IG Markets, who quotes Reuter.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under the burden of new doubts of market participants about Europe’s ability to sustain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has strangled its sight on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridors of narrow changes until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsughe Akino, foundation manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concerns about the future of the euro zone is striking on the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its low in a month and a half.
At 10 a.m. the European currency cost $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after the Chancellor Angela Merkel CDU party congress on Monday, on which a resolution was adopted, in particular, providing the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level.
On Tuesday morning, the Italian 10-year bond revenues reached 6.85%, and the Spanish bond revenues with the same period of reimbursement reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the exchange of time to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by a paralysis under the weight of his debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be a "main task" of his government.
Spain was hit by markets before parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The gap between the interest rates on the 10-year debt bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic maximum.
Expecting growth in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3% due to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised the direction of a decrease in the second quarter, with a 0.1% drop in GDP instead of a stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded a 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first assessment for the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy :
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason for consideration of the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bring fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are studied.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, the demographic development will lead to double the need for electricity by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population will be deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill up the growing deficit of fossil resources to continue the production of electricity continuously, without forgetting the most important need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalance – a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
This is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which puts its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its set, renewing the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on the Tri-Mile Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes given as an example, reality is contrary to this argument.
Berlin’s choice will result in increased cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump of carbon dioxide emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months all these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable.
We should consider the example of Denmark.
The European champion in the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to interruptive wind; resulting in carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices respectively 65% and 50% higher than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price per energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a great increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of the purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country’s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 mediated.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole playoff of small and medium-sized enterprises specializing in international trade and creates a lot of jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to donate a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French nuclear equipment and services exports.
Which electric engineer will order the EPR, planned to work for sixty years if it is planned to close its manufacturer?
To resolve the energy equation, it should be recognized that there are no divine or devil sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions, indicates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy,ining the highest level of security is undoubtedly vital.
In France, we have a security body that carries out uncompromised and transparent control of existing energy centers, such as Flamenville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same assertion of safety.
Over the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the installation of the reactor and unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will get lessons from this accident, as it came from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that enables to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, the stop of its construction in Flamenville will be a great gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, cleansing them the way to conquer leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legally to seek the best combination of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsibly to allow emotions, dogms and predicts to get the top of a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from various sides – the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “state of human rights”.
Then there was the administrative disturbance of foreign students, which came into the news releases when the Minister of the Interior ("Liberation" from May 23) stated that France "no need foreign talents, stoneworkers and officers."
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
Right and left are very agreeing on this.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac stated that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers,” and in 1990 Michel Rocker explained that France “can not accept the poor from all over the world.”
The difference is only at the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country by the Polish water pipelines felt both left and right.
Both sides see immigration a burden for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande was limited to banals, saying that “co-work will allow us to solve our immigration problem.”
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summarized the latest data on immigration (Special people: How migration formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University publishing, 352 p.), among experts there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
The limitation of immigration leads to weakening growth and decreasing employment.
The fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the idea that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-qualified, provoking a decrease in wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants supplement much more than they replace the local labor by performing jobs that lack the local labor.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon would be difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, the mutual complementation existing between local and immigrants leads to the fact that the income of immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers.
Jovanni Perry estimated that an increase of 1% of the migration flow leads to an increase of 0.6-0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity imported by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were based on immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profits to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, a immigrant arriving in Germany at the age of 30, for his life will bring to the state budget a net profit (income minus expenditure) in an average of €150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, was trying to "dental" to get into the missing growth points.
The mentioned teeth, which were used to scare immigrants, gave the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to conceive European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time a fragile.
The European continent must remember that, inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century he survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to end up enthusiastic over its enemies, it was enough to organize the vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon’s “Little” time, it is known that this comes from the surface of thought.
Universal voting, although it is a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it and can even become a “instrument of oppression,” as the former philosopher-Republican Ethan Vashro said.
No, democracy requires much more – public space, public spirit, values, organization, power division and control, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first of all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the true and false Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be considered to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy is now moving and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now not targeting the side.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as appropriate and in chaotic order.
"Cart-blanch" for an absolute European monarch or a jump with the legs to the fall of nationalism - what choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of the leaves of the gillotine, but of the implementation of a joint, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is unknown how many of them will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis – the crisis of Europe.
The whole Europe is entirely subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is completely humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole Europe gradually loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgently necessary to restore the leadership of the European project under popular sovereignty.
Because only by joint work Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of each’s debt, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The outcome from the crisis will require solutions at a whole European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal, socialists and Jacques Delore are now all demanding a European economic government.
Let it be so.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into life, is another madness and a new fool.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We need to build an unified Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe on a political level, a true popular European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Uncontact chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card Exhibition will open on Tuesday in Vilpente, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 ends with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important is the non-contact technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply carrying a card over the reading device.
This year, 460 million uncontact chip cards will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units) and make up 10% of the world’s chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts with more modest positions: 400,000 non-contact Visa cards are in circulation.
But big shops are increasing the pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontact MasterCard Pass.
To move to a higher rate, the banks need to supply the equipment of their customers.
“Two major organizations in France have promised in the future to systematically distribute among their customers bank cards adapted for non-contact use,” said Gerard Neboui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments via mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future payment means, i.e. the mobile phone.
Until now, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is necessary for such transactions.
“They were delayed.
“But they really have to go off next year.”
“We expect global sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Crédit Agricole announced that it will conduct an experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 iPhone customers and employees will be equipped with boxes that provide non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch the offer market, allowing its customers to pay through mobile phones.
Terrorist front spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the bonds of the Islamic Maghrib with the Boko Haram sect.
It has been confirmed for a long time the alleged links between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Muslim Magribe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Mesahel even said that Algeria is now confident.
“The way these two organizations use and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without getting into the details.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French citizens in Nigeria in January revealed two links.
The kidnapped people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with a few of the kidnappers during the operation carried out by the French special units.
Among the ruins left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sim cards belonging to the terrorists.
Here is terror.
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who lived a long time in Majiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram cavity, and the other - a person allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but it is undoubted that we need to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kune Amouvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly obvious in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly complex explosives of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community led by Washington is now putting pressure on Abu Dhabi to pay attention to the problems created by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people without interest.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Majiguri at the mosque, school and imama-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in the house means "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization achieved rapid success.
It is politized and demands strict observance of sharia, and its activists have begun the struggle against the unfair central government.
It is mainly aimed at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed a special activity, committing numerous attacks on police departments.
The reaction of Abuji, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern votes.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action, resulting in the killing of 80 people in Josh, and then another in Abu Dhabi.
In June, in Abu Dhabi, Boko Haram organized the first attack of a murderer on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which goes from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned by all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi is consolidated in Mali and Nigeria, and the Somalians from al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Hudlak Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
The world as it is seen by Republican presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mit Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, and more precisely, simplified ideas?
If the Republicans were listening to the presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mit Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the loud but lacking details of foreign policy statements, which are traditionally the strong side of the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
The myth of Romney, who has the best chances of standing out of the "Old Good Party", threatened to file a complaint on Chinese citizens to the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of whole industries to Asia.
Worse if this leads to a trade war, he said.
John Hantsman, the former Obama ambassador in China and the only candidate in a complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that was emotional.
He called for a solid but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Hansman, who is in the bottom of the ratings, has remained unheard.
in the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions can’t stop its nuclear program.
“If I’m elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his promises to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated disgraceful ignorance of cases.
He recently called on to confront China’s military threat because Beijing is trying to a nuclear power – obviously without knowing that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
To resort to the torture of suspects of terrorism banned by Obama in 2009, also recommends Cain, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
This is all very far from the Republican candidate of 2008 John McCain, the foreign policy worker.
The opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to lower the tone about fighting terror.
They righteously insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the early withdrawal of the “rabbits” from Iraq, his captures in Libya, which brought him the reputation of a weak politician.
Attack is not so simple.
The population considers a positive balance of national security with Obama, who destroyed Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are bound in the sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is launched.
It is intended to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of states and governments, took part on Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra's performance and exciting snacks, in the opening of the North Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutte together turned a symbolic valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Through the new gas pipeline 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will be delivered every year to Western Europe by the first pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the Leningrad region with the territory of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55 thousand million cubic meters of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
And the possibility of building the third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project encountered the strong resistance of Poland and the Baltic states.
The North Stream will actually allow the gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding the passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia, threatening to close access to the Western European markets.
At the most tensioned moment of the debates, Warsaw did not stop comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet Pact, indicating an alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe seeks greater security of its supplies.
But the price of Europe’s energy deprivation, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to its understanding of a direct union between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already on the outcome.
“This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that connects us organically,” said François Fillon, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent big gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the widespread smile on the faces of the Gazprom heads, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is a technical advance.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel locked into concrete to protect it from the boats of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to cross the mining fields left since World War II.
“The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, the North Stream company’s spokesman.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal dragon with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel shells, without breaks throughout its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers renounced it because Sweden was not excited that the Russian state company would forever settle on its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will interrupt the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
Thus, in case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to the designers who designed shots designed to run only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by the submarine robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by the apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and thrown forward by the gas flow.
After arrival after 3 full days of journey at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for smallest repairs.
The circulation of the gas is only due to its pressure.
It is 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies have joined their efforts to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint enterprise called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate a gas pipeline.
His headquarters is located in Zuga, Switzerland, where taxation is favorable.
Then Gazprom leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of the amount of gas it will actually be transported,” says Jens Müller.
The funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be 7.4 thousand euros for two pipelines.
The investment of GDF Suez will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will pay their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline goes out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore planted with hollow trees.
The valves of 4.5 meters of height form a gas output terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before transferring it to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full power it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Brands of Moleskine
Moleskine, created by the Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
He has the smell of adventures, the hours spent on the letter at the light of the candle.
The Moleskine block is easy to find on the straight-angle black coat, on the scratch, on the yellow-white sides, as if it wrapped with time.
However, the Moleskine recordbook, such as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, has decided to launch design blocks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's consultant, took on the responsibility for the launch of a new product.
The block is inspired by the old manufacturing technique, the moleskin - a laked cotton tissue, which was used, for example, to cover the strawberries.
It is affirmed that this type of blocknotes are highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has matched today’s taste with the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondy, who has since become the managing brand in Modo Modo.
Success has come.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We were far away from production in the first years, when only 3,000 blocknotes were produced.
Moleskine crossed the border of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It’s hard to set the profile of a typical buyer because the blockchain attracts a businessman, a student and a person of a free profession.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and educated.
The small Italian company, which at first had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She spreads its blocknotes in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small cities and has been able to acquire widespread fame.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter, despite the appearance of the email,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently the brand organized an exhibition "The Environmental Way", where architects and artists showed their own blocknotes.
In August, he also launched coverings with a leopard painting on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, handbags, computer bags.
Success that raised jealousy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which entered a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the rate of unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week of Disabled Employment begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons remains twice the average, namely 19% against 9% for the population as a whole.
is foolish?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes the Week of Employment of Disabled People.
“In 15 years there will be significant progress.”
“At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not two, but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot of work ahead.”
There are many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them more elderly: 37% over the age of 50 (17% in average).
They are more likely to have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and from 2.3 million students in higher education only 10,000 disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for disabled people against 38% in average.
In short, all these are criteria that make the return to work very difficult and that make the essence of the problem," said Christian Grapene, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies hire people with disabilities.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that changes, but too slowly.
A study conducted by the IMS-Entreprendre Association on Cité order in April showed that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “imaginated humans in wheels or mentally or mentally insufficient.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of disabled workers, set in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
“Today we’re about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
The number of “taxed” organizations, as well as paid amounts, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros) in 2007-2011.
“The 2005 law, which lifted the tax, created a strong pressure on the company,” explained Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects awareness growth, especially in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with a number of workers from 20 to 49 have disabled workers against 82% of organizations with a number of workers from 100 to 199.
Asar: “What Happiness”
Before fighting with the Siny on Tuesday evening at 20.45 p.m., Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they got from this friendly match.
We will not come to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the tribune of Stade de France, George Leicens and Eden Azar agreed.
Five months after the departure of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his advancement and the fact that he is a Belgian.”
“I want to go further,” said the player Lilly.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, this is one whole, he is justified.
“I’m in Lille all year and I’m not in Belgium.”
“I have to make glasses.”
Lost in stock, in front of this match with France, in the match against Romania on Friday evening, Azar arrived in Saint-Denis to finally "blist".
Not to forget, however, the concept of “rejoice”.
He has supported the Blue since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the special character of this match.
And especially that on the other side are the Mother (Debush), John (Kabe) and Adil (Rami),” he reminds.
“We just crossed our roads.”
“To have the opportunity to play against them is pure happiness.”
Leicens gently reminded of “the pride.”
The pride to play in the holiday match.
"The pride" also claim as a " neighbor" that France "was the foundation of a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Nazna.
"Loran Blanc was like a strike of a grape, he is admired.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in one plane with the lead of the blue... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our small Belgians are growing,” he emphasized.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
“You’ll make sure that in the future matches, including this against France.”
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal Paulo Bento begins his match against Bosnia (22.00 p.m.) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost the sense of reality.
“At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paul Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt that the Team, which he has been driving since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is within 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in the hell, it is clear that the game is not finished.
Although Portugal dominated in the match for more than an hour, it failed to the goal that would calm her.
“This is a good result, which, however, brings a certain risk.”
But with themselves, on their brightly illuminated stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the eyes of the audience, which should be enthusiastic, although the match will be very stressful,” said the optimistic but reasoning Bento.
“We are expecting a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We still have a 50% chance of going to the Euro 2012,” the successor Carlos Ceroch said.
Nizhny Novgorod on Friday in the match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese victory.
Nietzsche could make the Bosnians.
“It’s a good result, but there’s some risk,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical advantages and the players have a lot of individual advantages,” he added.
As it was already in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put the maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think."
This is a good idea, but this time it is realistic.
