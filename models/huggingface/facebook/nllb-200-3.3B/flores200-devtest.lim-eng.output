Although it appears that an experimental vaccine could kill Ebola, no drug has yet been clearly shown to be effective in treating pre-existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, was initially found to be effective in practice, but formal studies showed that it had less benefit than was being studied in reducing mortality.
In the PALM proof, ZMapp acted as control, meaning that researchers used it as a reference point to compare the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's brief and recognizes the absolute urgency of the Olympic family to maintain a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, would be better served by encouraging meaningful change within our organization, rather than by decertification.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Some authorities say that the plumage of this animal was a light brown on the upper side with a pale or carotenoid coloured underside.
The foundation also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in cattle.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - beaks and feathers - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature control or to keep warm. The researchers suggested that, although this is the start of a young dinosaur, it was an adult plumage rather than the end of a tail.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the start of a young dinosaur, the example showed a mature plumage rather than the doings of a cuckoo.
A car bomb exploded at the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than two dozen others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic real-life observations of the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the star system and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the constellation Sagittarius.
The scientists could conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter is contained in a halo of some kind around a star, and consists of many small pieces.

In France, voting has always been a low-tech experience: emperors simply put in a hatchet, stop at a pre-printed piece of paper, and then place their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have established the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The codification of procedures for French election law is relatively strict.
Since 1988, ballots have been required to be transparent, so that keys and numbers can be seen when no envelope is already in the mail at the beginning of the mail and no envelope is added except for those duly numbered and authorized keys.
Candidates may be invited to witness any part of the process. At the end of the day, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh's Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in jail awaiting trial, but any evidence of her appearance may have been tainted by the large-scale publication of her image in the press.
In other parts of the UK this is common, but Scottish law works differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially criminal.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line when they publish photos etc of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall guidance on prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comment will be given in any case until the indictment.
The document will apparently refer to the border issue, which Palestine will base on the borders of before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects that come up after the hearing include the related state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has maintained an existing military presence in the valley for ten years without signing an agreement, as the PA agreed to leave such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the incident proof with pest control had to be checked by rangers, as the proof was followed and the effectiveness was judged from it.
A partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the current CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The often violent protests were caused by the failure of elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, in total, six of them have caused fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (EHI) said that there were 27 incidents related to the machine.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed about 34 additional heating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's publication of the bulletin by saying it regretted the news.
The earthquake struck at 07:19 local time (Wednesday, 09:19 pm GMT) in Mariana.
The crisis managers in the Northern Marianas have indicated that no shortage has been given in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a couple of tourists from Hong Kong were seen on their bus by a Filipino police officer.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Some stranded tourists have been rescued, and some of the people who survived have been rescued.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, have been released, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research happy-time delivery in his spare time.
His research showed that adding a hormone would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
Cinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black-box" flight recorders on Thursday.
Fellow clerks also brought houses to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died in the night of two months. Very unique, so she is. Strong woman. 
Dustin Golddust Runnels remarked that Luna wasn't as crazy as I was... maybe even more... and she's going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 respondents surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of opponents of the Republic of Australia increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29 percent of those polled thought Australia should soon become a republic, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications available to overcome the pain, as they have been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the best-known prime number to date on January 25.
Since February, several people have verified the discovery using various hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply to Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists have long sought to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth is formed, since comets have long been associated with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political ignorance and stupidity".
He is expected to become president in 2016.
NexGen is a system that the FAA claims would enable aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce CO2 emissions annually.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide information to pilots.
There is no additional transport and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transportation made it possible for the match to be played behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, however it was thought that this process would be much longer due to cross-breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Canctus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into many shapes, and it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn in thin threads, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be very thin and can be applied to other metals, and can be so thin that it is often used to add hand-painted images to books called lost manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and can be used to make an indicator using red moss juice.
The color of moos sap varies depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been given electrons (as hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Toss the two other pieces together and then squeeze them with sharper, tight knots to form a ball.
The voice on these knobs will react with the outermost layers, which appear odd and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjodara had a playground connected to an advanced sewage system in almost every home.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization often formed part of the public baths where men and women gathered in close company.
If someone is calling you from thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes to study the Earth's atmosphere, which is a source of light and heat.
For example, a man-made rocket over 100 feet high is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The Council has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing it has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
We used the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized food, alternating between knee to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat the many small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and livestock.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps him from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called groups.
Groups consist of one to three related adult males, together with thirty-year-old females and young.
The species are usually related to one another and form a large family of frogs and toads.
Cute troops behave just like rows of wild wolves or their owners, animals that are surprisingly similar (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very dutiful to their owner.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can swim (though not well), jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is the same group (Genus Panthera) as leopards, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the hollow roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of harsh written words.
Ocelots eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and livestock, and almost all of the animals the Ocelot hunts are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow other animals to find food (but) to survive, remembering where they have been on Earth.
They can see well in the dark and move very quickly, hunting their prey by burrowing into their environment and then burrowing into their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, when they move across a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island so they will not usually return), they will often find themselves in a different environment as hosts.
The new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other features or adaptations to be as strong a competitor as they previously were.
The original population has not changed at all, retaining the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble each other more closely.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process includes speciation, which is the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also produce light.
We make our bodies from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of us eat what we eat. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the most important reptile of its time, so it had nothing to fear except from other Mosasauruses.
His long, dark hair was covered with more than 70 fleshy hairs, each set apart from the rest in his mouth, meaning that no one could escape from the hairs before they were cut.
We've never seen them, but they couldn't have been a living thing, which means turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
This was the case with all the animals that lived in the sea, even giant dinosaurs such as T. rex, which were thought to have fed on them.
While most of their animals would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual animal items, including wild boars, peacocks, slugs, and another type of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the rich ate their meals in the same room, the rich often ate together in the same room, sitting on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman food could not have contained any animal that later came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they lacked maize, tomatoes, onions, and cacao, and no Roman had ever tasted a shrimp.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of a god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests attempted to provide the means for ceremonies and festivals in the court of the gods.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the open air.
Food was cooked in the main street, shops were open and the street was paved, and stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely valuable.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and called it "Greenland".
But according to his findings, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
While each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
As seen in the movie National Treasure, a checkered flag was written on the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true, but while there is something on the back of the document, it is not a chessboard.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence" dated July 4, 1776, were inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and the text was reproduced above in the document.
While no one knows for sure when it was written, it is known that the largest ever document (measuring 29⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was actually rolled up for storage during his lifetime.
It is therefore likely that the notation was used as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had joined the Germans in 1940, and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, as the Allies entered southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and French troops had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work together as a cooperative society.
Civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, reflecting the changes that society has undergone.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a continuum of cultural imprint, and a culture of diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no single authority to levy taxes, and because it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It also had no authority to impose tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be enacted, and states submitted to the central government only so readily that their representatives were often overwhelmed.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Italy national football team, the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often considered an  archipelago geographically.
Tawai's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which began a transformation in the production practices of native grain varieties and hired Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, relinquishing sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had ruled the island since 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what it originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
The most commonly used format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format by the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced, but more importantly, the image distortion has been overtaken by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of even numbers) would therefore be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family of orphan formats) are similar to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics and yet maintains a certain degree of order.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that cut the image vertically and horizontally into three segments (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which was powerful and powerful, was being brought down.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-pervading power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the most important teachings of the church is that many people have spent money to pay for poverty and that the church's money should be just enough.
The church had been based in Rome for over two thousand years, and its wealth and influence led some to question whether it was really meant to be.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and provided vital military and civilian protection, while this blockade was contrary to generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties.
Britain has international waters dug to prevent ships from entering entire portions of the ocean, even putting neutral ships at risk.
Although there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a cheque and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (see manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period which occurred for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was intense warfare between many nobles who vied for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the most prosperous periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people struggling to hold the highest seat at the Great Hall in Xian.
This has had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country is the people and not some ruler.
Even after the revolution, the bar was open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful men to succeed.
The same was true of the army, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the realm of everyday life, and he visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Noor for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, and once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the bright, beautiful lake above and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dolls, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arch is shaped like a V and the lower arch is shaped like a notch or square without any lower edge.
To go up means you have to start at the top and push the arch, and to go down means you have to start at the frog (that's where your hand is holding the arch) and pull at the arch.
An upward bow tends to generate a quieter sound, while a downward bow is louder and more assertive.
Many are free to sign their own markings, but remember that the printed markings are for a musical reason and must be respected.
The death-threatened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of mercenaries on 6 October 1789.
She travelled back to Paris in a coach, unringing by a few people who wrote and threatened against the king and the queen.
The people of the village went to the king and queen to open the door of their chariot.
At any given moment, a member of the royal family is sweating with the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles for the death-scared queen.
The war cost of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay much of the spending and interest on bonds that were traded on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street's pioneering broker.
Of course, the super-profits that would result from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the order's foundation.
The age at which the buildings stand is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which supposedly ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is governed by an unenlightened logic that is based on scientific laws and the technological progress of humanity.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself is a process rather than an influence of culture on politics, and that technology in turn "effects" on such outcomes by being inherently, rather than socially, conditioned.
So you could say that a person's life is always more important than his death.
But, given that the country is economically unfit for a couple of reasons, new ways of doing things have to be invented to make it possible for them to have a job.
Many people also suffer from accidents on the road, and this has led to the development of new techniques in the clinic for repairing broken bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography was individual, and in the course of time habits and cultures arose that were closely connected with that geography, and these were, in harmony with the location of the society, superior to any existing laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The city's reputed luxury period began around 400 AD, and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
The public attention to him declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts of wheat and barley, which were much more valuable than they had been on the Byzantine market.
In the same year, the name of the capital of the empire was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may persist for 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the time being the introduction of cloth-making to clothing, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is conducted for the production of sufficient livestock to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often biological system that uses stored seeds extracted from the ecoregion, either by grafting or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel proudly by matching criteria and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or any combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, manners, and decorum.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the problem of socialization is to look at the few accidental cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some children are locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this deprivation of birth was due to the parents' refusal to give the child the most serious intellectual or physical attention.
Abused children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or abandoned.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral pup is fully raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) that almost always resembles that of the specific parent animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
All project-based learning should be made easier and more interesting, but it is also a step further.
Positions are not learning, but rather a tool that provides support to people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Styles can be both virtual and real, in other words, a leader is a type of steiger but the same is true for the small paperclip moon in Microsoft Office.
Virtual tasks are internalized in the software and are intended to challenge, stimulate, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
The US foster care system is supposed to provide safe, vibrant care providers, stable education and reliable health care.
Care is supposed to provide for all needs that arise in the household from which they came.
The Internet combines forms of mass communication and also communication between people.
The precise characteristics of the Internet seem to provide additional dimensions as it overcomes the "risks and rewards" approach.
Such "lierability" and "sociability" have been proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal friendships and "continuous relationships" were also cited by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivations when they examined people's responses to the audience of the websites.
The use of video surveillance has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is empty by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, showed that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to perceive its sincerity.
He thinks that such advantages in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domesticated ones.
Twenty-three years of research have shown that there are two poles of genetic modification: inheritance and extinction.
Mutations introduce new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination lead to alternation between the two poles with each generation.
On the savanna, a primate with a human-like gut may be able to obtain enough amino acids from available plant-based sources.
The consequences of this are severe depression, disability, and eventual death.
The most easily accessible sources of protein would be those available in fresh fruits and vegetables, but these are easily digestible by primates such as cattle, unless they are cooked.
Animal matter (such as worms, termites, eggs) is not only digestible but also provides high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not expect our own ancestors to have solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness rather than waking you up completely.
If you find that you set the clock in your bedroom, it may be placed on the opposite side of your room, requiring you to get out of bed to set it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, forcing a person to stand and lie down.
The amount of inner joy that a person possesses correlates, in contrast, with the amount of tension in body and mind.
The lighter the panning, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute joy and happiness.
Anyone can achieve happiness. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded to include the Mahayana way of life and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of enlightened living.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (loss energy) is awakened through yoga practices, meditation exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Godhead Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channel is cleansed, the chakras are activated and the sense of loss is enabled.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States, and by the end of the war, the clash of systems, pressures, and cultures led to the countries separating.
Only two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would take the next 40 years and would be fought, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize near the Romanian shore.
However, these plans were almost overturned almost overnight, when more than 800,000 men of the Soviet Red Army invaded and occupied the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and military.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of marines was to ensure that your country had the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time limiting the ability of your enemy to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using U-boats, was busy trying to stop this trade.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as well, just like the other pieces of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran as far back as 10,000 years ago.
Cultures and tribes began to use them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and houses.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that grazed over the hills or other fields, and were accompanied by a shepherd, often a child or boy, as well as the more familiar shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
While these roads were generally built from parallel planes of wood, they were lighter and thus more heavily loaded, and thus traveled faster than the gravel roads of the time.
The railroad was introduced to keep the tracks in place, but over time it became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if the beams were covered with iron.
This was the case, but iron provided much more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails, and by 1767, iron rails were completely removed from the market.
The earliest known means of transport was by foot, and humans began walking by foot with the arrival of Homo Erectus (literally "Erectus erectus"), two million years ago.
Their ancestor, Austrolopethicus, was usually unable to reproduce.
Bipedalism has been found in Austrolopethicus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs for seven million years.
We could live more peacefully with the environment, we could join the Nature Alliance, and we could protest against the reduction of our income.
In many cases, this may be merely a symptom of struggle, but if we do not have a temporary solution, we will continue to look for and solve problems for a long time.
It is clear that the world has been greatly altered by human technological and scientific advances, and problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of some.
After it was accepted by the convention on July 4, a handwritten note by the convention's president, John Hancock, and secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing house.
The entire night was made between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in his speech at Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and he presented it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document, though the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that only one group of dinosaur ancestors is still alive.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about animals remind us of dinosaurs.
They have long tusks and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T. rex.
Virtually all computers are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that an easy diagnosis is difficult to make.
The first indication of poisoning would be the presence of an open vial of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Look for the label for specific first-aid instructions for that poison.
The term kiwi is used informally by entomologists for this large insect.
This name comes from the ancient familiarity of insects, as their insect-like bodies were used to parasitize humans.
Mother and child live in their own homes for a long time, and the one who is born lives in the house of his or her host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among youth and older adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is better for them and their children not to have children.
These mothers might choose to give up their offspring for adoption.
Adoption gives the biological parents their rights to the child that another parent has not yet fathered.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is the way most scientific research is conducted.
Not only that, but the design of experiments serves to test hypotheses, as well as asking questions and making observations that guide knowledge.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific and psychological insights were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language was lost, Westerners lost their philosophical and scientific ancestry.
Many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior often depend on endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Drumming rhythms, which are not a normal response to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run through cells even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important to demonstrate that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many effects depending on the size of the DNA fragment, the type of mutation, and whether the cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in the germ can be passed on to the offspring, whereas mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the landscape, including plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird and park watching, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visits, photographs, and leaflets about orangutans in Borneo.
However, many people leave the village alone to go to work, and are passed by others who are on their way to where they left.
Each of the dynamic transport systems is connected to, and supported by, its own cars in some way.
Science now suggests that this carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere for the last two million years, leaving a stable state that has supported human evolution.
Each contributes to society and uses public transport (OV).
In developed countries, there has never been so much concern about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems fail so much? Why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong with this?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and sensations between two points and the interactions they make between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers do behave with some degree of predictability; thus, drivers can be reasonably consistent with mathematical models.
To represent flow, relations between three quantities must be established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These associations help with the planning, design and operation of the road network.
Insects were the first animals to be able to fly, and their ability to do so helped them avoid enemies and find more easily available food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them more opportunities to hide in small places to avoid predators.
Whereas the few insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are here and fly only for a day.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus, a lunar explorer, saw that the planets revolved around the sun.
Some thought it was similar, but many thought the opposite: that the sun revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because it doesn't ask if the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, with more than eight times the flow of the world's largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes measuring up to four miles (6 km) wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi), fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
However, the construction of the pyramids from stone continued until, by the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids had been surpassed in size and technical innovation.
Inhabitants of the New Kingdom in Ancient Egypt inhabited the monuments of their ancestors that had been ancient for thousands of years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the least number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language spoken by most of the working population in the state, although Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since antiquity of the existence of simple chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because these can be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive materials.
Aristotle, a philosopher, thought that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of aggregation (respectively): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, which he also thought transformed into new substances to form what we are.
Alloys are simply mixtures of two or more metals, and many elements are found in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are metals such as gold and silver.
The kinetic also has alloys that also have small amounts of non-metals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions could fit on the end of this sentence.
So, the penlight was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing were invented, penmanship declined to an ever-lower status.
People no longer rely on computer screens, and they no longer have to go near a computer to sleep.
What would happen to the keyboard if something new were to happen?
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It is about the size of a heavy card on a mountain top. The splitting of the core then releases some of the energy.
Some atoms have no nucleus, meaning that they are more easily separated from one another with little to no energy.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and debris, and its outer layer is called the mantle.
The body is about 70 km thick on the light side and 100 km thick on the dark side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker above the highlands.
The lava was then more easily brought to the surface, and the surface was then more easily exposed to the heat.
Content theories focus on finding out what drives people or their opinions.
These theories suggest that some people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories explain why people do certain things and why they do or do not do certain things in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor theory.
More generally, there are two behaviors that can occur when one member of the team leaves the other; one end of the spectrum is willingness to remain one of the group.
Leaders have difficulty making difficult decisions such as imposing punishments, assessing performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, I turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done to make it his or her own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in alienation between leaders and the rest of the team.
Online teams are subject to the same requirements as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Online teams often function as a single point of contact for the group closest to them.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because there are different ten-zone boundaries that are not understood by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management to which each member must report. The "invisible team" is the standard for each member.
Why would an organization spend so much time on the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of its goals is to translate learning and organizing concepts into practice.
When all available resources are used effectively by all departments within the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
This allows the organization's collaboration process to overcome an obstacle, leading to new innovation to serve the needs of a customer.
For an organization to thrive, leadership must create a culture of sharing knowledge and organizational development.
Angel (2006) outlines the Continuum approach as one method that can be used to help organizations perform better.
Neurobiological data have provided much evidence for a new theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and the field has become much smaller and more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to study brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information with materials to build simulation models that can help us understand processes of the mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction feel, it is an important part of computer science, dealing with behaviors, learning, and intelligent adaptations in a machine.
AI research is concerned with automating tasks that require knowledge.
Examples include control, planning, and routing, the ability to help customers with questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
The tasks have become separate disciplines and focus on finding solutions to problems in real situations.
AI systems are commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but have also been applied to various computer and video game applications.
Excursions are part of every classroom, but often teachers would take students to places where they would be able to relax.
Technology provides a solution with virtual trips, allowing students to view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in class.
Sharing an online excursion is a great way to reflect on an excursion and share all of the experiences with your classmates.
For example, each student at Bennet School in North Carolina creates a website about their trip to the state's capital city, and each year a website is created, but versions are kept online as a side project.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and although students often start with cluttered grammar and spelling, the willingness of audiences to change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts writing better to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging forces us to be less naive about the world. The need to be interesting to the public inspires students to be slum and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a means of collaboration and motivation for students to learn outside of school.
Good use of blogs allow students to become more analytical and critical; by actively participating in online discussions, students can establish their positions vis-à-vis other pieces and also give their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and has many galleries and museums that showcase the country's history and heritage.
Further south are Niagara Falls and further north are the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario what foreigners consider to be typically Canadian.
Larger areas to the north are not populated and some of them are barely inhabited.
A comparison that surprises many people is that there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most diverse continent in terms of natural resources.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the countries, and that is very important for the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route around the Cape to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is believed that something is wrong with a man, whether it is true or not.
It can also help to wear a ring (but not a door that slams out).
Women should realize that there are many cultural differences, which can lead to shocking experiences, and it is not uncommon for women to be poorly dressed or to be followed, etc.
The must be clearly in the men's line and not afraid to stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanco was founded by Berber settlers in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merinids as a major port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branco, only to abandon the city after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and Spanish merchants renamed it Casablanca when they established trading posts there.
Across Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find shops to buy traditional items such as tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs and a whole spectrum of geese, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the eastern part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma, and the lava covered most of the city, including the city center.
Goma is generally safe, but once you leave the city, you must check the status of the unrest in North Kivu.
The city is a base for discoveries from the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the best mountain gorilla safaris in Africa
To explore Goma, one can use a boda-boda (bicycle taxi). This normally costs around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant exotic lands.
Although Timbuktu is a deserted city, its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to sand erosion.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic flair than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Krókkedille River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 (19,050 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each optimum for different types of nature.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all African national parks, there are daily maintenance and admission fees for the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which also grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the region of Hong Kong and is considered by many to be the most important settlement.
The parade builds on Hong Kong's skyline, resembling a glittering bar chart made visible by the presence of water from Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hon Kong, we left the island and went to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
Most residents of Hong Kong's urban development are suddenly drawn to the conquered land on the north coast.
This is the place where the British settlers had taken and are looking for until the colonial era, so this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest expanse of mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from coast to coast to Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indai is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not typical of the mangrove swamps but contain some of the last remnant of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges delta.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 of which one third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a haven for wildlife, with estimates of 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 wild deer in the area.
Inter-district buses depart (across the river) throughout the day, but especially for those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because regional buses tend to be crowded, it is a good idea to buy a few days in advance.
Most districts are covered by small Japanese huts that are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing taxis is a quick and comfortable way to travel to places like Paro (now 150) and Punakha (now 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 271 feet (83 m) and are 1,300 feet (378 m) long and have two arches of 12 feet (3.5 m) wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) and was completed in August 2011, but not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs officials expect it to be operational.
The guaraní were the main indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the base of other tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, often called "the great province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Flakland pound (FKP) whose value is equal to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and, outside of Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, however, British and American currency may be accepted, check with the owner to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is not possible to change Falklands' names outside the islands, so do so before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures of +30 are very normal.
Winter can be harsh: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the cold seem colder than the thermometer says.
Seasons are not particularly "rainy" or "fruitful": the amount of rain remains the same throughout the year.
However, many animals in the park have been raised to be human, the animals are nonetheless wild and should not be led or controlled.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters (330 feet) away from bears and wolves and 25 meters (25 feet) from any other wildlife!
They are also agile, able to attack bison, elk, wasps, deer, and almost all large animals.
However, some beetles are injured because they do not have enough distance to survive, and because these animals are large, agile, and can be dangerous, they are often left outside of their nests.
Also, be aware that smells do not attract, carry or cook food that smells, and keep the campground clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious maritime impasse in 1889 when seven ships from Prussia, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British battleship was lost, and nearly 200 American and Prussian lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of chief Tapua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many streets, including Auckland's two harbours. The most famous are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the area of North Harbour) stretches across the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost always beached with sand on top of their heads to swim safely, and they have almost always been covered with dust.
The stretch of Tamaki Drive is located at Waitemata Harbour, in the scenic Mission Bay and St Heliers road in the middle of Auckland.
In some cases, families may be able to afford to live together and have a good supply of shops nearby.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but is enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
Australians have embraced the idea of "flat white" coffee, a short black is "espresso", cappuccino is served with roasted (or milked) beef, and tea is steeped in milk.
The hot chocolate is of excellent quality. Fruit juices are expensive, so excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and it is known for its rare seeds on the reef.
Always take advice from the local authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to all safety precautions.
The whales came for nearby beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
They do not live in the sea, their main habitat being the river moors north of Rockhampton.
Often, travelers are given the option of sleeping anywhere until they return to their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other accommodations, such as camping, through the travel agencies.
Travel agents often offer packages to take you to and from the airport, or even combine flights and hotel packages.
They can also set the search warrant for you if you need time to think about the body or other documents before the application (such as visas).
However, any cancellations or cancellations must be made through the travel agent first and not directly at the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the grounds, and most attendees consider that to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll have to be happy to get a campsite close to the city.
Please note that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may still be places on the festival where it will be played until late at night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
When the North East wind blows in winter, check the location of the hut, as it will cause excessive noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises are inclusive of time in the city. Cruise passengers tend to have no visas (check the advance).
Casinos are careful to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and clocks are often broken, and outgoing ones are last to be found.
They often have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some events have free entry, but if you are caught, you can't make a good judgement, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay awake.
Anyone who is driving at higher elevations or over mountain passes should take into account snow, ice and weather.
On icy and cut-off roads, it is very slippery, and cannot be driven as on other roads.
During snowstorms, snow can fall so much in a short time that it can be hard to sit on.
Visibility can also be very poor due to falling or dripping snow or due to condensation or ice on the walls.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic is usually not affected by the weather.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to overseas trips to explore the beautiful African wildlife, especially the savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars short distances and standard equipment makes them comfortable.
Lions, cheetahs, and panthers are sometimes shy and can be better seen with a viewer.
A safari on foot (also called a book walk, or walking) consists of a series of one-hour or two-day treks.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you had booked your ticket and accommodation for the 2020 exhibition, you would have been in a difficult situation.
Cancellation thresholds vary, but since late March most coronavirus-related cancellation thresholds will not be valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are held.
Tickets for most parts are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price of around ¥7,000.
Stripping wet clothes can help to make them wet.Many hotels have a stripping machine and can even be used when no one is in the room.
If a stretcher is not available, or the threatened lion does not have a stretcher, then you may use a feather if they do have one.
Be careful not to let the dust get too wet (it could shrivel, or worse, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain hazards.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes at least a few minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective and if you are making your own, you should consider purchasing bottled water from reliable companies.
Travelers can encounter unpredictable events that they cannot control.
Ozone can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, poison, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure humans with physical force are usually not considered to be non-venomous.
Duty free shopping is a way to buy goods without paying taxes or excise duties in some places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often coming through isolated forest terrain.
You don't even have to travel over sandy roads, but be careful: steep slopes, narrow passes and sharp curves often come along.
Maximum speeds are noticeably lower than on any subsequent stretch - averaging about 35-40 (56-64 km/h) - and the good following from them is even more important than normal.
Strange enough, the mobile service is much better than on other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, richly filled and varied, similar to that of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit bodies are common, so apples are used all year round, and fresh and tasty apples appear in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.
This small but delicious dish is called Berliner, and it is served with pancakes or fries, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that includes herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "dry" depending on how much water it contains.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is widely used in curries. In southern India and some food regions, coconut milk is more popular.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term for a gigantic variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, without further clarification, it usually refers to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now spread throughout the archipelago, has a few simple dishes, the most commonly found flavours of which are Javanese peanuts, chillies, sukka (mainly Javanese coconut sukka), and some aromatic spices.
The tracks are the supports for the router's feathers that hang down on either side of the room.
They provide more stability for the router but can also be dangerous if the router gets stuck.
If a horse's rider is thrown from a horse with his foot caught in the tracks, he may be dragged along as the horse is pulled away. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures may be taken.
First, most routers carry riding boots with a heel and a rigid narrow sole.
Secondly, some halls, especially English halls, have a safety fence that prevents the hall's tracks from falling over when pulled backwards by a falling road.
Cocamo Valley - Chile's main mountain range, known as South America's Yosemite, with a wide variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The summit often has a spectacular view, and climbers from all over the world are constantly on the lookout for new routes in the endless possibilities of the walls.
Mountain sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports.
Skiing as an activity is a very important destination, and is often the holiday that is spent in places where skiing is possible all the time.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers as early as 5000 BC.
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was founded by Nore in Australia.
Backpacking on skis is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but not the same as, alpine skiing, or mountain climbing, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much more rigid skis and boots.
The ski route can be viewed as a similar treetop route.
This fit can take a greater amount of effort than walking - but the room also does not often create the same sharpness as in cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-maintained trails.
Europe is a small continent with many sovereign states, and traveling to many countries usually involves many visa applications and passport controls.
But the Schengen zone works if you're a country.
As long as he is in this zone, he can cross without any control.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each individual country of the Schengen zone, which saves time, money and administration.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques; some valuation companies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographic variance, with the average age being lower in the United States than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antique, though they are younger than mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Saami and the culture around it, while trade is important for many other people with other occupations.
Traditionally, not all Saami have kept reindeer, as do those who live off fish and game, and reindeer are often kept as pets.

If the country you are visiting has a negative travel advice, this may have consequences for your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also ask the governments of other countries for advice, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
One example is that Americans in the Middle East are in a different situation from Europeans and Arabs.
Travel advice is merely a brief description of the political situation in a country.
Opinions tend to be fleeting, general, and limited in comparison to information that would otherwise be available to us.
Weather is the general term for any type of weather that can be potentially dangerous with the potential for damage, social disruption, or loss of life.

Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through the scanners with any degree of privacy and dignity.
Moose currents are trough-like currents of waves that often break on a shore on a reef or similar.
Underwater topology causes the water current to be concentrated at some deeper strokes, and a strong current to deep water can form there.
Most drowning events, due to evasion, result from attempts to swim against the current, which is impossible.
Until the tide is out, swimming is not allowed any more than usual.
Please note that you are not being recruited depending on your strength, or the watch you are being shown, and are awaiting rescue.

What many people fail to realize is that travelers who come back to you lack patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the coolest things around for the kids.
The pyramids are darker in color and are in their original state before the play begins.
I mostly listen to the noises of tourists and cold-blooded people. The story of sound and light is like a comic book.
The sphinx is used as the background of a long story and is also its narrator.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the other pyramids were illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have most of the bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the mainland, with the largest island being King George Island, which contains the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livington Island, and Deception, where the crater lake of the still active volcano forms a beautiful natural reserve.

The mountains of the peninsula converge on a plateau, and then rise again to form the 360 km (220 mi) long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern portion of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica where the Vinson Massif peaks with Mount Vinson at 16,820 ft (4,892 m).
In remote locations, without a mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as it must be connected directly to the satellite to be able to make calls.
Today, it is often used for navigation, including pleasure craft, and also by expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
A gap year is an increasingly popular option for people who want to travel and study.
This is often so successful because they can then leave for a year without it having a major effect on their academic progress.
In many cases, taking a gap year may increase your chances of being accepted for further study.
Usually, one must pay tuition fees to be accepted into these study programs.
Finland is a great place to go by boat. The "Land of a Thousand Miles" includes dozens of islands, in the sea and in the archipelago off the coast.
In the archipelago and in the sea, there is no boat.
Although the archipelago of islands and the largest seas are big enough for all ages, small boats or even kayaks provide a different experience.
The only thing that is common in Finland is a boat for everyone, whether you are a fisherman or a fisherman.
Only Norway, Sweden and New Zealand can do this, but there are few countries where this is the case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is around 40).
Most Baltic cruises have an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that much of the historic city can be seen for a few days while sleeping in the ship at night.
If you are going alone on the shipboard excursions, you do not need a separate visa (except 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in their brochures, but Berlin is not located on the lake, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flirting can be very scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never been in a relationship or if they have never had a traumatic experience.

The most common way to fly first class or business class is to put down a substantial amount of money (or better yet, to have your company do it for you).
But there is a price difference, because you normally pay up to four times the normal price for business class, and eleven times for first class!
For direct flights, it is usually not worth looking for discounted seats in first class or business class at all.
Logistics companies know that there are a steady group of people who will pay a small fee to fly quickly and comfortably, and they ask for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also spoken.

Trade has been restored between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, second only to Istanbul, and is a major transportation hub.
Once the historic city of Smyrna, now modern, developed with a large commercial center, around the great harbor and surrounded by mountains.

The area also has an extremely diverse range of wildlife.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx and wild cat can be found here, along with many other species.
When visiting monasteries, women should cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries have shrines for women who have no one with them, but if you bring your own, especially the one of color, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun who enters.
The moon must also carry a long book to cover its knees.
This can also be rented at the entrance but is not usually washed after each visit so you may not have to pay to use this option.

A popular simple dish, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with oil foil, tomato and other available ingredients such as chicken, tuna, etc.
All nouns that are pronounced with the same letter are written with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is especially important to distinguish between some words and their subject matter.

Pronunciation is easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to write are the c and g because the pronunciation depends on the next vowel.

However, some Spanish speakers might conclude that Portuguese is so much like Spanish that it cannot be studied separately.
Observatories are generally not useful for modern research and are often used as museums or educational institutions.
In earlier times, lighthouses were not as big a problem as cones, and were usually built in cities or on campuses, and were easier to access than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are located in giant complexes in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the cured chicken, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Plants are best seen in their natural environment, so please resist the temptation to pick and eat just one.
Even if a maintained head is present, no plants can be picked; this is because the head must be thrown out without permission.

Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries, and in non-Christian countries around the world.
It is a tradition to have a night vigil in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are naturally Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it can also be seen as a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches observe the Easter Vigil on the evening of the seventh day in the Easter weekend, when people begin celebrating the resurrection of Christ at 12 o'clock in the morning.
All animals that once lived on the island have now arrived by swimming, flying or diving.
