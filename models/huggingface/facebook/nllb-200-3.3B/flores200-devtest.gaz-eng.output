This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had a shell, not just the widely known hypothesis, but even the most detailed details of their remains, such as colour and linear alignment, that we have not been able to confirm in general terms.
Scientists say that the upper part of the wings of the dragonfly is covered with a yellowish-green colored coating, and the underparts are covered with a yellowish-green coating.

In the few tree species that have a digestive system similar to that of humans, they have difficulty getting the amino acids that their bodies need from plants.
Worse, failure to do so has many consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available genetically modified food is the whey and barley, which contain protein, but this is as heavy as animal protein, as we would be if we cooked it outside.The most prepared plant material was the protein found in the whey and barley, but these are difficult to digest in our animals without cooking.
In addition, animal feed (goats, ducks, eggs) is not only easily digested, but also provides high-quality protein containing essential amino acids.
Everything must be kept in mind, and we should not be surprised if our genes solve their protein problem, because that is precisely what the chimpanzees in the sauna are doing".
