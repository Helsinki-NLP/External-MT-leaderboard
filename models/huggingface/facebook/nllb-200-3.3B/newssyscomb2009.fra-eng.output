Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent of the total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have led to a significant weakening of the two parties in the current grand coalition, as well as a marked strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), whose position as the current chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously threatened, is suffering particularly heavy losses.
The electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the national political scene.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain the country's leading political force with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared to the 2006 elections they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost almost nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
This is the worst result of the two major parties in the post-war period, and for the People's Party, which triggered the snap elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
And yet, the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were voiced about the possible resignation of the party leader and current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would, a priori, facilitate the path to the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the FPÖ would have won 18 percent of the vote and the BZÖ 11 percent - the socialists at the same time expressed fears of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still united, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ split) on a joint government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already said that he is ready to work with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently relying on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent threshold and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of cooling
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegally collecting cockroaches in India were not resolved, the result would be, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of relations between the two countries.
The minister said this today in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur", he said after the meeting, which was organised on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said, coming out of the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, as the case was under the jurisdiction of the Darjeling.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
Mukherjee said the best solution for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then ask for bail and await trial in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same view during the talks.
"He advises that he should appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such aid had already been provided by India.
"We want above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition going back many years.
The Indians recognize it too", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem faced by Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech researchers to be a gross violation", he said.
The Minister avoided the question of whether he had received a promise from India to take up the matter.
"I've already received a fair amount of promises", he said.
Czech referee for the sea-bottom fight
He approaches an electronic map on the wall, depicting Australia and its adjacent marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent. He's interested in a little spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is as large as the continent itself", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea's 30-member team.
Its head, the director of the division, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The atmosphere is one of zeal and enthusiasm.
The seabed is a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
There may be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms as yet unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A deeper world than the dry land
The coastal states have recently begun to aspire with vengeance to new underwater territories.
They are exercising their rights, as agreed upon in a 1982 UN convention at Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country concerned.
The latter can, according to the convention, claim exclusively all resources of the continental shelf.
"For simplicity, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil that forms a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles which represent the exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the outer boundaries of the continental shelf must be supported by a large scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific-technical support.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have been successful so far", adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, the first country to significantly expand its submarine fleet, has recently been a global phenomenon.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the area of the seabed, which the commission awarded it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefits they will derive from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be inestimable.
Gradually, other countries will also submit their own applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Here, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, declared by convention "the common heritage of mankind".
No State can now have an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this area is allocated by an international institution established by convention.
"But make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike", says Director Mikulka, adding that "they are clearly defined and their regime is enshrined in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint organization Interoceanmetal.
In 1991, the Community, together with investors from a number of other States, was granted the status of a so-called 'pioneer investor' under the Convention.
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area the investor is prospecting for is slightly larger than the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moving, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract from a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another legal expert.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a realization.
It's like a little potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene to free the hostages.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but they never went into action.
More and more details are being revealed about the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
The Federal Military Police specialists, officials from the GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were present at the site of the liberation.
As the Ministry spokesman said Monday night, German forces were not finally required, the hostage-takers having released their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian Government has reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it into the support force.
"Thankfully, this has not happened yet", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped the group of tourists in southern Egypt, five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian travel companions.
After being abducted in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained unclear, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information has been given as to the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and the special forces were supposed to have taken off on an Air Force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The US House of Representatives rejects the bailout
The US House of Representatives narrowly defeated the $700 billion bailout plan.
The Dow was plunging into the abyss.
By a vote of 227 to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout of financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, the program that was supposed to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not win a majority.
In a dramatic move, the supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the soundness of the $700 billion plan.
Barney, one of the Democratic representatives during the debate, had called on the members to vote in favor of the plan despite its unpopularity.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened", he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by over six percent, 600 points.
The reason for this was investors' concern that the state's bailout plan might fail.
It went up again shortly before the vote was over, and then, after the announcement of the failure, it fell again.
Experts now predict further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The programme will require the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to enter into force.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
As for bookings for the coming months, according to one study, the turnover has increased markedly compared with the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the thirst for travel among Germans remains insatiable, according to the study.
As for winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures already dominate the autumn months.
The sales figure would have increased by about 11 percent compared to 2007, according to DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures of GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
The travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
The DRV said that travel to the USA would be particularly in demand because of the low dollar.
The increase in reservations would be about one third.
Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be particularly desirable destinations for Germans.
The group trips in particular are in great demand, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
With the rising prices of energy and food, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for a trip arranged individually".
Consumers can save money with discounts on advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, among other things, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very busy, so that sales figures will again be higher than last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann's hits or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pitchers and celebrities in Tyrolean designer suits.
A beer party event.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde TV hostess and wears a custom-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing we have in common is that we're only three minutes into the beer party, and already the photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling out their memory cards - very flattering, and that's on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to have served its purpose.
As a beer festival tourist and a normal resident of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was limited until now.
But once you get to Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks sullen or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit gets a few odd eyes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman remarked that I had not fastened my apron properly: "On the left is free, in the middle is virgin, on the right is a bald, in the back widow".
I'm discreetly tripping my loop from the back to the left.
"That's better", she said, laughing.
Others don't go to such great lengths to achieve these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple feathers, which say "Too drunk to get dressed!" and expose their naked buttocks to us without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He thinks it's gorgeous with a long "oooo"
He tells me all this after he's relieved from the cup he drank before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a dumpster.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers".
Others are not so fortunate as to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, a small band of rescuers rushes to the party square and must attend to the poor drinkers.
Instead, the nurses work in groups - always four of them, dragging their beds covered with tents.
This is how it works for most beer party goers: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunk under the tarp are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything", one of the rescue workers shouted in response to my question, then disappeared into the fray.
Police identify the victim
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there soon after.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been out on bail since.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was considering joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with an observation tower at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt as to the greatness of the enterprise, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind the imperialist game, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that reached Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, brought about by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded, destroying its roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling into ruin, engulfed in the tangles of history.
But today, the railway to Anatolia and all the eastern points, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has led to a
Now it is time for a new engagement policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Suat Kiniklioglu, a Turkish AKP MP and one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half hour journey, shaken by noisy tracks whose cadence reminded me of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of the change of the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art structure, built of stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many pastry shops where middle managers in suits and ties - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
He's got a suit and a tie and even a Blackberry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its home country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
It was not the case with either.
She had to do both.
But at a certain point, I asked if Turkey should not choose.
"Turkey", he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two".
He then pointed out something that almost everyone I spoke to had recited to me: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to be that Europe is metaphorically travelling on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night's sleeplessness, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal for the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the time when Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there's no longer any doubt on the continent that this country could claim to be fascinating.
Memoirs by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include all the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to it, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and that was all because of the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how many times Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself"?
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants"
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His technique of the wand was absolutely clear, precise, though never dictatorial or flashy.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should be knighted, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me- and, on a few occasions, they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "focus only on certain people".
A lot of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary for William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This is from a letter from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and was at the same time completing a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and '51 in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hubl, and in the summer of 1952, at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second round for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
The new minivan has even more space inside than its predecessor, which was already well-suited to living in.
Added to this are some refined mechanical features, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution faced with revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz is aesthetically very similar to the previous model, there are many changes introduced in this minivan.
Among them are innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before we look at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was released.
Firstly, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although less well known in Europe, the Honda Jazz is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83.000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazzs since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch hopes to sell 2,000 Jazzs in a year.
It is precisely the launch of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to make up for the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's executives hope to end the year with sales of 22,000 cars, 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
With this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to gain that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a compact five-door hybrid - 14 feet (4.37 m) long - that the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50 percent of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the other half will be split between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (an additional five centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (an additional two centimeters), and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
However, the height does not change, being 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and so does the interior space.
This gain was due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a petrol reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system  can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as taillights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened at an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialisation, this small model will be equipped with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine revs.
The first 1.2 litre engine developed 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It's called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and it represents the first steps towards collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technology Center of Nissan Motor Co. have built this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the general director of public relations for the Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most important of all are the bee's compound eyes, which can see in more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles within a two-meter radius and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to that object, and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Motion Laboratory and the project's chief engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it to do, not in infinite directions like bees.
For this purpose, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device has to just process information and act on that data.
It doesn't need to retain the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
This may surprise you, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes".
This represents the first development of new instant collision avoidance technology, a technology that will be introduced in mass-produced cars in about ten years from now, according to Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future application of this technology could be to adapt this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
You have to admit that the United States Treasury, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say, the Hotel of Bad Credit... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the hotel manager makes us think several times if it's a good time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
I'm sure this game provides useful information but not much detail.
It's more of a teenager's game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since buying a house is unthinkable.
Morgan Stanley opens up its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, will buy 21% of its shares for $9 billion, a move that has been accompanied by a sharp fall in its stock market.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a price of $25.25 per share, for a total amount of $3 billion.
The price used is 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be executed at an average unit price of $29 per share, 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, were down 6.79% to $23.07 at about 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is a significant opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status", said John Mack, the US group's chief executive.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its business but places it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday further show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago", explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, in Tokyo, "we thought that the participation would be entirely in ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of approximately 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if the latter trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "dramatically" reduced its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, which has seen its stock price melt in half as the cost of insurance against default on its debt skyrocketed.
This cost was recovering on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To rebuild the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he was the third to vote on a draft of a new Constitution.
The mission was accomplished, as 64% of the electorate voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results showing 80% of the votes cast.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, he needed half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a non-governmental organization had predicted a large victory for the "yes" side, with a margin of victory of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way", he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in a calm manner according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving for it the "planning of development" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currency sent by its emigrants.
The bill, which was introduced by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants stronger powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and has the ability to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president has begun to implement in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault against the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
The hostages, apparently in good shape, arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in 'good health', and 'no ransom has been paid' to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
The group of hostages were taken on a four-wheel drive safari on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and were tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It comprises 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, which organizes the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces, flown in two helicopters, launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fire took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled", said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "Blitz" had been sent to Sudan in total, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, spoke from Belgrade, where he is based, of the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the intelligence services, special forces", he said, without giving further details.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on patrol carrying the kidnappers, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The military claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which was immediately denied by the movement.
Literature - the silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying the present election campaign.
That's good.
But one aspect of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums of money that are being given to starving small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no real laws to effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the only castle in Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our neighbouring United States, it is written in their country's constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with digging up history, preserving with three under private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when developers and decision-makers hurl their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a rostrum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are helping the Belgo-Dutch bank, the first European banking institution to be in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments reached agreement at the highest level on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been widening for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy up almost half (49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its holdings, including, in the first place, the mainly insurance business acquired last year from the Dutch company ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares started to plummet. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be allowed to fail.
On Friday alone, the company's stock fell 12 percent, to its lowest level in 14 years.
Since January, the stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's managers, is not realistic.
The company's management blames the uncertainty overseas, in connection with the adoption of the US rescue plan of 700 billion dollars, for the fall in Fortis shares.
The papers have already received a slight increase on Monday.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to head the bank, as the new managing director.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received a substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
There was no panic among the bank's clientele and no agencies were stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about his drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of information on prescribing medicines, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting your chicken coop to a fox", Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions for medicines, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage dependent on the state of health of the client who comes, and if they think the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination and only signed insurance contracts with them after they had heard the results.
For the last ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies the data concerning the purchase of medicines by the person in the last eighteen months.
For example, if a person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, placing him immediately in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of this program in circulation, some of which determine a risk factor at the same time, so there is little left for the insurer to do other than the paperwork, but tiny problems can still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that one drug can be used for different purposes, for example, some mixtures can be used for migraines or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in research and data analysis, and they have to ask permission from the patient before they can collect the necessary information from the pharmacy.
Now they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their misconduct in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to data on the use of medication, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to extend the scope of government control over companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognises that this is not enough and that is why he has developed his programme even further, which would make the transmission of data conditional on the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurers do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So, in the end, the chickens are dependent on the fox's kindness.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners to each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other issues, which are largely global.
Today there will also be a France-India summit, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be the main topic.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a wider say in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi's candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too long on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, the current President of the Union, Commission President Barroso and the head of the diplomatic service, Javier Solana, met the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double their trade in five years, an increase of more than 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious target.
In this sense, they have harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation from a legal point of view, which will allow air traffic to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009 at the latest.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, on one side, and New Delhi, the EU's ninth largest trading partner, on the other.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as were all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on the subject was mentioned.
The completion of the Doha round of trade deals has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate agenda, including a target to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that a global market should be established at the climate conference next year, and that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is today visiting the French capital, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the information of the press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries to occupy the 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than 403,000 titles on display, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Papillon: Italy will be present in an institutional way, with an Italy Point - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in the Structure Room, in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular in relation to that for adults and children.
We found the plane belonging to Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the desert of Nevada, has been found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there are no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared", he said at a press conference.
So the sheriff made it clear that no human remains were found on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead.
The US Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it is indeed the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
It's two documents bearing Fosset's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was stopped a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history by setting a long series of records.
On his sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete a round the world flight in a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world non-stop.
Among these records was the one of flying to 15,445 meters in the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you're not expecting.
An unusual four-wheeler with a distinctive design, with sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, the GLC is the latest of the star-house's compact off-road vehicles, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring a breath of fresh air to the sector.
The unusual and unconventional content of the new 4x4 GLK will be the reason for the announcement that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
The hype that accompanied the launch of the new car was a new form of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture will give the impression that the car is out of the picture.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glock will be illuminated spot by spot, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertisement Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motoring communication.
We shall see whether this formula will succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and that, until now, had never created any big problems.
Ni had never clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The developers are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not many in fact) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags with their home town on them: Saturday night, they were all taken away so they wouldn't be identified.
They're inspired by the English tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a group of real Nazis, Levski's.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to the Italian fans for the game: all of them were registered, and therefore easily controllable.
And Viminal had indeed checked them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans with a history of stadium crime, were denied tickets, and couldn't make the trip.
Now Viminal is waiting to read the documents that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, it could be that the arrested or identified in the riots fans purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attendance at Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will not set foot in the stadium.
I'm glad you did.
But now it is time to fear and emulate: that is, others may be added to the first 150.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize those who behave like this", said Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the national team match on Wednesday in Lecce"
In Puglia there is a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
The Observatory is meeting tomorrow, the Casms on Tuesday, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which are dealing with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce chorus, and the arm extended during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took over from Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect of Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002, reside.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to hire Mussolini, but it is certain that the behaviour of those 150-200 tifosi was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observer's No. 1, "crimes must be attributed to the country in which the crime occurs.
Until now, this group has been within the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to the Mameli anthem: these are not crimes either, but if you will allow me, they are not polite... "
