Welsh AM feel the irritation for you as a joke
There was a concern among some AMs for consideration that their names should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It began as a result of a proposal to change the name of the local body to the Welsh Assembly.
AMs across all political parties are concerned that it could lead to stigma.
A Labour AM said that his members were worried that the party was falling behind the Twp and the Pwp.
For book lovers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means piece, pwp means waste.
AM wearing a fur coat said that the same is true of all "angry", that it has other similarities.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open minded" about the name change, but said it was a shortened transition from MWP to Sports.
In this sense the Welsh w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English u.
The Commission of the National Assembly, which drafted the legislation to implement the name change, stated: The final decision and any interpretation of the so-called Members of the National Assembly shall be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Plan 2017 authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the objectives which found widespread support for calling a national assembly the Welsh Assembly.
On the question of the names of the AMs, the Commission was based on the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP, but the MWP's choice received the most support from public opinion.
The AMs do offer other options, but the struggle to reach an agreement could be a major pain for Chief Executive Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a written order for the changes in the coming weeks.
The law for the amendments will include other changes in the way the national assembly operates, including the law for the appointment of the AMs and the technical of the system of the assembly.
The AMs will have a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they vote on the bill.
Macedonians to vote on change of name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum was held to resolve a long-running dispute between neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its neighbours in the mountains represents a claim to its territory, and they have gone further to block its application for EU and NATO membership.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, an opponent of the election and the name change, has said he will ignore the election.
However, supporters of the nomination, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say corruption and the name change are the only price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's Bell Calms as Harlem Church and National Day
"In the past, elders I spoke to said there were bars and churches everywhere", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there are none.
He said he understood the origin of the bars.
"People are coming together in different ways" now, he said.
Bars are no longer a regular place to go.
For the church, it is worrying that the profits from the stock market will not last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced with larger residential buildings, which would be equipped with a type of people that would not help the sanctuary in the rest of the circle.
The vast majority of people buying apartments in these houses will be white, he said, so they will hasten the day when the mosques will be completely closed because it will be difficult for most people to enter these houses and become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white conventions before Harlem became a black community - the City Hall in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The first Methodist congregation left in 1930.
The six black congregations that worshiped nearby named the building after themselves.
The black congregation took over St. Martin under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest by merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who prevented the admission or support of blacks in the market.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the church of Father Johnson planned to renovate the building, they built the bell.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "The poor man's bell".
The expert who struck the bell in July called it another: "Cultural treasure" and "historical equipment cannot be replaced".
The professor, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had attended the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been said about St. Martin over the past few months is the story of a confused group of engineers and builders, some of whom were brought in by the church leadership, others by the diocesan department under the Bishop.
The seminary - a church administrative unit, filled with leaders - wrote to the church department in July with the suggestion that the church department "would like to transfer the bills" to the seminary, even though the seminary was not involved in hiring engineers and technicians sent to the church department.
Some church members complained about the lack of revelation in the church department.
Shark wounds 13-year-old in California lobster raid
A shark fell over and injured the 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he forced his way into the water for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The rape occurred just before 7 a.m. on the banks of the Beacon River in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and friends were in the water about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, then he and some people rode over to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was a dream to catch lobsters, but then he realized it was a knock, "Hit me!"
I'm finished!'
With all his legs torn, Hammel said he noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The shark was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said the shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed the river from Ponto Riverfront in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas within 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles also said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but not many are considered to be bad ones.
Sainbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainbury is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening a cosmetics line with a specialist shop filled with professional assistants.
As part of a major move into the UK £2.8m beauty market, which continues to grow the clothing and home furnishings market in return, the cosmetics line will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and rolled out to other stores next year if successful.
Cosmetics are on the rise as stores try to fill the space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves, and appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will expand the size of its cosmetics range to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will also have a niche in the area with a logo similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The stores are reopening their storefront to make most of the products animal-friendly - something that consumers are now demanding in large quantities.
In addition, fragrance shoppers will test-license two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The move from online shopping to buying small daily groceries at small local stores means that supermarkets have more work to do to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that small shops will continue to be like supermarkets of supermarkets where the department store tries to drive back the losers Aldi and Lidl by adding more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos retailers in many stores, and has brought in a staggering number of Habitats since buying the two companies two years ago, which it says has boosted the food market and made the purchase more profitable.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to re-establish a demand for drugs failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after a dispute over how to share profits from the pharmacy stores in its large customer base.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would work on the plan, by adding the size of the well-known skincare stores such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics line to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also put in money and special staff who will be immediately available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to fit all needs, a beautiful environment and a comfortable atmosphere means we are promoting a cosmetic space that challenges the traditional way of doing business.
Angry with Peter Jones as Holly Willoughby signs £11million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones filled the page as TV presenter Holly Willoughby signed off on an £11million deal between his lifestyle business to focus on his new deal between Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for the home clothes and furniture store Truly.
Both businesses have been included in Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop marketing.
This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Den owner Peter Jones by stepping down from their successful live-in business in the final moments - to focus on her new deal with the famous Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Reports said Jones was angered when a TV fanatic admitted during a rally on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deal - worth £1.5 million - meant he no longer had enough time to focus on his clothing and homewares business, Truly.
The deal, which is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop deal, was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated fortune to £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain to visit one of her holiday homes.
One headline said: "Truly the most important thing for Holly.
It should be his future in a way that will take care of him for the next decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone involved in a riot.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it came so close at the beginning.
There is a warehouse full of products in Marlow Headquarters that is ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's anchor, who is among Britain's most prominent money-making personalities, could cost the store millions of dollars due to the huge sales of products ranging from chairs and candles to bed linens and homewares, and the possibility of another murder in its wake.
It may be the end of the long line.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about ten years.
Willoughby and Capp started Truly in 2016, Jones, 52, joined as executive in March.
The couple share vacation funds, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV advertising company.
Willoughby will be the company representative of M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A person close to Jones said last night We can't talk about his business anymore.
A strong word when we love each other
He was ridiculed for receiving hate speech from the media for making some remarks that would be considered "unpresidential" and for having good faith for the North Korean president.
Why is President Trump so forgiving?
Trump said in a press conference that he was pregnant.
I have left nothing behind.
He also said Kim was interested in a second summit after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step in disarming North Korea's massive nuclear arsenal.
But the talks on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top envoy Ri Yong told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "common response" from the U.S. to North Korea's recent disarmament operation.
Instead, he added, the U.S. continues to impose punishments designed to burn.
Trump followed the concept of true faith in his closing remarks.
"We are doing great things in North Korea", he said.
We wanted to fight with North Korea.
Millions of lives could be lost.
Now we have a big family
He said his efforts to improve relations between the Kim Islands have yielded positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free prisoners and repatriating remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his different approach in speaking about the merger with Kim.
It's very easy to make a president, but instead of having 10,000 people in the stands trying to get into a crowded place, we have about 200 people standing here, Trump said, with a crowd in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy and Kill Islands
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international organizations were told that they were not governmental and were not wanted.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prime reason for seeking foreign aid.
Most of the time, unfortunately, they made it clear that they do not need foreign aid, so it is a challenge, Mr. Sumbung said.
With Save the Children booking a trip to Palu, it is unclear if foreign workers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign companies would be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
Due to the fact that Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes, the city is not prepared for the earthquake.
While a tsunami watch has been built in Aceh, it is not common on other beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, even with the warning signs, could contribute to the death toll.
In the best of times, traveling between most of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
National disasters add to the confusion.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is currently on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's infrastructure upgrade of Indonesia has been a topic of his election campaign, but he has also spent money on roads and subways.
But the lack of funds and the killing of Mr. Joko while he awaits re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also keeping pressure on the long-running sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim criminals in street fights, using knives, bows and spears, and other ugly weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's response in the second leg of the final against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge caught a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was 30 yards outside Chelsea's goal as his team were trailing 1-0.
He put the ball in his left hand before shooting at the top of the post.
The test went over the box as it slid down the top right corner of the net.
The ball then passed Kepa Arrizabalaga with the elbow extended and fell into the net.
It was trying to get into the situation, to catch the ball and players like Shaq and his team face each other all the time how much more powerful, so I tried to get myself out as much as I could, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, touched him once, didn't think much about it, shot him immediately.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 after a break after a goal in the 25th minute from the famous Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward gave Mateo Kovacic a back foot pass in the game, before he ran out of the halfway line and hit Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick knock on the halfway mark.
He threw a beautiful ball, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard crossed the line and scored the goal at the head of the net with a left-footed shot and passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool and Napoli will play in the first leg of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are expecting Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll has reached 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
It is alleged that a large number of people were trapped under collapsed buildings caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and triggered a wind of 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is littered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, in a murder investigation for stabbing a woman
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhard, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews and John Road, a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the murder investigation.
Police are asking people in the area to come forward if they see or hear anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would ask anyone in the John Street compound in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can capture anything on the dashcam footage to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found was a local from Birkenhead, found in a bank.
This afternoon friends believed that they and the woman had come to the camp to ask about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is now underway and the police are ready to report the incident to the victim's deputy.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mew tried to lock himself in the building but police told him that no one was entering or leaving the building.
She was stunned to learn what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be a long time before they are allowed to enter again.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came into the camp in tears.
He was repeating the bad news.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were in the lane and another outside.
Some police officers stood in the line and watched the buildings.
Anyone with information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, dial 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and report 247 as of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has become the latest monument to the "Rewrite History" controversy.
His expulsion would be a punishment for his similar Taliban-like damage to many of England's cultural and religious structures, done by troublesome Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described Mr Crick's suggestion as "a joke" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Club, said: It is inevitable that the current debate over the removal of the statue and the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the focus.
The desecration of religious symbols that took place during the English Civil War was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would be unjustly executed for the crimes of his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's brilliant portrayal of Cromwell was a misrepresentation of 19th century thought and a part of the human narrative that many people believed should be exalted.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is held in high regard, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a protector of parliament for external influence, in his words the authorities.
But that perfectly accurate expression is now the subject of a long-running and ongoing historical debate.
Clearly, the conflict of the mid-17th century settled the development of our community, and Cromwell was a prominent figure who illustrated one aspect of the divide.
His maturity as the Supreme Protector is something to be praised and remembered.
Chinese Farmer Suffers from Pig Slaughter
A pig laid down and killed a farmer in a market in the western and southern parts of China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name Yaun, was found dead, torn, covered in blood near the pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer approved vaccination of pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He and his nephew are said to have started a journey in the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her nephew found her dead, and he found an open door into a pigsty.
He said that inside the pig house there was a huge amount of real blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination concluded that the 550 pounds killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My nephew's feet are covered in blood and scars", said the nephew, who used his father's name and pointed to Wu, according to the Guiyan Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yaun's nor his nephew's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from being re-spoiled, while the police were collecting supplies in the camp.
Yuan's family and businessmen negotiated a condolence payment for his death.
Although rare, actual sexual activity was recorded in the early days.
In 2016, a pig raped a woman in their garden in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, 650 pregnant women and children pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After being eaten by an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CNC News that pigs are often violent but the taste of blood can be a stimulant.
They are just afraid to stand.
They are little children, they have great ambitions ... they cannot harm you.
You should give her the proper respect, says Joe.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall to spread across the southwestern US.
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is moving toward the icy waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring torrential rains that will cause flooding across northern Mexico and the western and southern parts of the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 Winds, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, it was located 385 miles west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was expected to head north on Sunday.
Now, a large swath has begun to accumulate across the Pacific Ocean and head east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California coast on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep into the northwestern and southern U.S.
Rosa will bring in 10 inches of rain on the Mexican side on Monday.
Then, the heavy rains mix into a large depression and create a heavy rainstorm that spreads to the West and South over the coming days.
Regionally, 1 to 4 inches of precipitation will cause severe flooding, wet grass and desert siltation.
Deep water flows will cause torrential downpours of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in the area, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As expected 2 to 4 inches of rain in parts of the West and south, especially across Arizona.
There may be flooding with conditions and rapid damage due to the nature of the storm surge.
It would be a very bad advice to go into the desert where there is a risk of a rainstorm.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into angry rivers with thunderstorms and forecasts of tornadoes and sand and gravel.
The massive opening and arrival would bring some heavy rains to the Southern California coast.
A rainfall of more than half an inch may occur, which can cause slight grass swelling and roads and slips.
This would be the region's first water drilling of their winter season.
Some of the driest storms will start to reach Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rains spread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Fourth District on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may see some strong temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the temperatures will remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over a short period of time.
There were a number of large examples of extreme weather differences across the U.S. on Saturday.
There is an almost 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moined, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat wave will continue to try to contract and extend again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see early October temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high chance of above average temperatures for the eastern U.S. beyond the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was watched by over 20 million people
Over 20 million people watched Thursday's testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his 1980 rape accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, on the cable network.
Now that the political standoff continues, the media is interrupting events that should have been on the agenda for Friday's last-minute broadcast: a deal that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has planned for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the House Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had tearfully slapped him and tried to strip him at a high school dance.
Kavanaugh, in a touching statement, said he was 100 percent sure he didn't.
There is a chance that more than the 20.4 million Nielsen ratings reported on Friday watched it.
The station counts the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen often has trouble keeping up with the audience on their station.
To illustrate, that's the size of the crowd at the football stadium for the winner or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionated editors strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, topped all networks by having an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day count, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with a total of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest increased as the talk ended.
Flake was the focus of Friday's talk.
As the moderate Republican media released his statement that he would support Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning with angry tourists and haters as he tried to board the food truck to and from the Judiciary Conference.
He stood quietly for several minutes as the swearing-in was broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
DO YOU think he is telling the truth to the people in our community?
She was told, "You have authority where most women do not".
Flake said his company had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the convention.
Cable networks and media were covering the immediate aftermath, when the Judiciary Conference was supposed to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for election.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee in the coming weeks, which the young Democrats are pushing.
Flake's mind changed slightly in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.
So after Coons's consultation, after several MPs, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was valid, because it made it clear that Republicans did not vote to support Kavanaugh and did not take the poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May and accusations by critics of "politicising" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of using Britain's future "politics" for her plan to leave the European Union and undermine public interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In a separate interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson raised his concerns about his Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect taxes on both sides was "a big nonsense".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police returned the glasses to the circle and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB said.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he believed in shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released the first report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commends the strong efforts of the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for uchu and his criminal investigation.
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a LSU basketball player.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was in "pain" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
This is what you think all the time, Wade said.
Volcanic ash erupts in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern slopes of the Mexican mainland.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano as damage was found in the crater, registering 183 gas and ash discharges over 24 hours.
The station detects a lot of noise and vibrations.
Images from public places showed small ash platforms and covered cars in Mexico City's neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have found the origin and activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 km) east-southeast of the mainland since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and separatists clash in Catalonia ahead of independence election anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as pro-independence protesters clashed with police, as thousands of people joined another protest to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote in a row.
One that supported the secession covered the faces of the police and blocked them from crying and turned gray, creating a black cloud of ashes on the roads that were often crowded with passengers.
A fight broke out later that day with the police using sticks to stop the fight.
For hours, pro-independence activists chanted "Never forget, never forgive" in front of the solidarity protesters chanting, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions within the region are high in support of independence within a year of the October 1 Madrid elections which saw the overthrow of the pro-independence Catalonia.
Voters voted overall for Remain and Independence, although the turnout was small and the pro-secessionists scorned the election.
According to Catalonia authorities up to 1000 people were injured last year as black police tried to stop the elections from proceeding in polling stations across the region of the major clashes.
Pro-independence groups went on strike on Friday to stop protests and support the national police.
The protest continued but they were forced to use another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, a lighting contractor who attended the separatist protest led by his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
Last year we witnessed one of the best moments of our lives.
I looked down on my parents for having the opportunity to vote but now we are ready", he said.
Despite managing a narrow critical victory in the regional elections held last December, pro-Catalonia parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their most prominent leaders have fled or are in jail awaiting trial for their role in organising the election and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded the protest on her mobile phone with the support of the police, said that the political parties on both sides provoked the conflict.
He said  people's hearts are trying very hard,.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia who has been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, said he would stand for election to the European Parliament.
"Setting up a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reverse the backwardness in democracy and the persecution we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested for repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
The car may have been hit by a car bomb at one point.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought victory
Livingston's move to Rangers was a shock to include Steven Gerrard in his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal stood out as Gary Holt's team moved up one place to Hibernia in second place.
Gerrard's undefeated Premiership side this season will face the top-flight Hearts, who are eight points behind, on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, extended their winless streak to six games, with Holt's head coach not having a losing record since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost their opportunity to strangers and the unwary
Holt's team needed to be ahead before scoring, their hard play caused Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson passed but lost his attempt before the goal, then Alan Lithgow was able to lose his attempt after he tried to get a header ball that Craig Halkett passed before the goal.
The four were content to let Rangers play in front of them, hoping to give the visitors a hard time with the ball dropped.
But that was the way they scored the important goal.
Rangers provided the frikik, Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set up Menga, who touched him once and scored from the middle of the box.
At the time, the Rangers had all the balls but were unable to pass the four defenders and post guard Liam Kelly had no problems,
The sequence continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly do his job.
Rangers post guard Allan McGregor's leg was knocked off Scott Pittman, Lithgow missed Livingston's ball again and fell to one side.
The ball came repeatedly into Livingston's box, which lost all of them, with two penalties missed - after Halkett had introduced Glenn Middleton's leg, one for touching the ball - and they were denied.
A terrible thing by Livingston - summary
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland and the Tony Macaroni Camp
A terrible action and consequence for Livingston.
On finding a man, they did well, and continued to pass the goods on their ladder.
The game and the team have not changed much since their return to the top, but the credit will go to Holt for his handling of the situation since his arrival.
It has many thorns.
Captain Halkett played hard and played defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the game.
The Rangers had no interest in their cause.
Even the best game they have seen under Gerrard, they have not lived up to those standards.
Their last ball was not enough - they only opened the home team once, a development for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
Laughter and blue and green (September 29) were seen by the Turkish and German leaders for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit and a pre-conflict visit to Germany - intended to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been at odds over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new and huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of people who did not support Erdogan - mostly Kurds - also made their voices heard, in opposition to Erdogan's policies and the decision of the Germans to welcome him into the country.
The protests are a sign of division that some German Turks call a tyrant while others see him as a dictator.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle rider killed in crash with car
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, east and south of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the guards visited him, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in a kidney accident while jogging on Childers Road, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said that the police are working to identify the man and inform the next person.
There are traffic closures and heavy traffic, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six workers injured in riot
Six prison staff have been injured in a riot at a high security men's prison, the Prison Service said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialists Tornado have been brought in to deal with the riot, which includes eight prisoners, grouped on one side.
The workers were visited for minor facial injuries there.
The Prison Service spokesperson said: Do not send prison officials trained to meet the current situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Don't visit six members for injury.
We do not tolerate rioting in our prison, and those who bring it will obviously be handed over to the police, they may spend longer in prison.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the city's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was being treated in hospital after a prisoner fell asleep.
In October last year, workers were called to a riot to solve a serious problem of heavy balls being used to overwhelm workers.
Tropical Storm Rosa Could Cause Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vega, Salt Lake City (Drought Area Possible)
It is unlikely that a tornado will hit Arizona, but that is what could happen in the early coming week as the remaining force of Tropical Storm Rosa moves through the Western and Southern Desert, posing a flood risk.
The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to parts of southern and eastern Nevada, eastern and southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was expected to pass through Phoenix immediately on Tuesday, arriving in freezing weather on Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has reported that only twenty-one tornadoes have remained in the form of tropical storms or hurricanes within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ coast.
The latest National Wind Rate Standards now predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with exceptional sums reaching 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Western and Southern Deserts including the central Rockies and the Great Basin may get 1 to 2 inches, with exceptional concentrations up to 4 inches and stronger.
For those who are not afraid of flooding, the cold of Rosa can be a disaster as the region is experiencing severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of this rainfall will be needed as the western and southern regions are currently experiencing severe drought.
According to the U.S. Summer Survey, only over 40 percent experience at least one extreme summer, the second highest, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa fell across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still in the midst of a storm Monday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The sea and the Pacific are cooling and so it is going down.
So expect it to hit Mexico with strong winds during the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall across Mexico can be severe, with the risk of flooding.
An estimated 3 to 6 inches of precipitation from Baja California into the western and northern parts of Sonora, up to 10 inches and strong, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move northward from Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona state line early Tuesday morning as a hurricane, which will pass directly through Arizona and into southern Utah by midnight Tuesday.
The most likely casualty of Rosa or its remnants is severe severe thunderstorms in Baja California, western and northern Sonora, and the U.S. West and South Desert, the National Weather Service said.
These tears are expected to create deadly flooding and drought in the desert, and wetlands in the foothills.
Midsomer Norton rape: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in an investigation into attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The young man was found with a wound in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in good condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock, Avon area of Somerset Police said.
The police have asked everyone to have a cell phone photo of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, was hurt, angered by Democrats
"An election for Judge Kavanaugh is an election to reject the brutality and excesses of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered heartbreak, anger from the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Assembly on Thursday, angrily and bitterly denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she assaulted him ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified against the accused.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans appreciated Kavanaugh's intelligence and character and encouragement" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the most mature legal mind of our time, a lawyer with a record of public service and civic engagement", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president took a different approach and referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican lead in the midterm elections.
Five weeks left before the most important election of our lives.
I don't go out, but I really do", he said.
 So I'm all over the place and supporting the best candidates.
Trump pointed to Democrats on the march to stop and prevent.
The first major election in the Legislative Branch for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Earthquake, tsunami, Indonesia kills hundreds, count rises
At least 384 people died, as strong coastal winds washed away dozens of people, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when winds of up to 18 feet (6 meters) fell on the ground in the evening, leaving many dead and damaging everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat started yesterday, people were doing their rituals by the river, they did not run immediately, so they were affected, Sutopo Purwo Nugrogo, spokesperson for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency BNPS said in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not reach its target, taking away cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami is said to have passed through the main river at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 islands in Palu.
The topography of the disaster area showed a large number of houses and shops damaged, a bridge that had risen and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquake continued to occur on the coast on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes affected a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for Research and Technology Implementation (BPPT) said the magnitude of the quake on Friday was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's landmass, which lies at the end of a long, narrow river basin, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "explosive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some people who were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, left 540 injured and 29 uninjured.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be as high as 300km (190 miles) along the coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the quake.
Communication had no message but soap from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, with its staff and volunteers deployed to the affected areas.
He said: "This has been an accident, but it could be worse".
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said strong winds came at the time the warning was issued.
In footage shared at a public gathering a man can be heard on a rooftop screaming and warning of an approaching tsunami as he tells people on the street below.
Within minutes, torrential rains swept down the river, washing away houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around Palu and left authorities in a dilemma and organizing rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aid planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is expected to attend the refugee camp in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami count has exceeded 800.
He Was Seriously Wrong.
With World Vision staff from Donggala safely reaching Palu city, while its staff were sheltering under the rubber roof erected outside their offices, they crossed the vicious circle on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said They told me that they saw many houses destroyed,.
It was terrible.
Even as relief teams began the daunting task of getting disaster relief started, some complained that international aid workers with the necessary skills were being prevented from visiting Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign money, equipment and personnel can only start traveling if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a park-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, OK, this is a national disaster, we can open for foreign aid but there is no official announcement yet.
As the second night falls on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the survivors hold on to faith that their loved ones will be miracles and a stimulus to the devastated part of the world.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled from a well.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under a bush for two days, her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, leader of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two paragliders for the Asian Games in free skating, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people arrested under the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As a paraglider, I have my own mental problems", he said.
Mr Gendon recalled one, within an hour of news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spreading in the paragliding community, he quickly sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the beach party.
His message, however, appeared only in a single gray sign, instead of a blue one.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent", he said.
Cold sweeps $26,750 during ATM raid in Newport on Levee
The robbers on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee at ATMs in Newport and Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was clearing the ATM in the hotel and was preparing to spend more money, Police Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While at work, another man from behind attacked the Brink's employee and stole the purse intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information for their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: Man used to be like Kanye West.
West, 41, has recently changed his name to Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes come ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new song Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show who cancelled it due to emotional reasons, the producer of the show said.
And while it is a shortening of his current nickname, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, when discussing his song title with a radio manager Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, we are.
It comes from Kanye, meaning alone, being alone - which is the expression of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
That fear is also an expression of who we are.
It was one of the famous people who changed their name.
Sean Combs is either Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has expressed his preference for the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former Western collaborator, JAY-Z, has used but sometimes not used red and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico has vowed to fight against the military for civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to stop using the military and soap for civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the student violence.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Mall that he would not use the military to oppress Mexican citizens.
Military gunmen opened fire on a cold march at the mall on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during a left-wing student demonstration that began across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by providing monthly scholarships for students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities and placing youth in criminal groups.
U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China becomes more marketable in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase its spending on research in the field, said AI advocate and researcher Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The debate came as several parts of the U.S. government made AI claims, even though the U.S. as a whole had no known AI plans.
On the other hand, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in new AI production by 2030.
Raising the funding for AI research twice would be a good start, I am sure that all other countries have already reached the U.S. level, but we are looking for the next big thing in AI, Lee said.
Doubling the funding could increase the chances that the next major AI maturity will be in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in China's most prominent AI company, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat America's most successful musician Othello, eventually becoming a vice president at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee believes in U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asks when the next one will be, to help identify the next new competitors.
Researchers in the U.S. sometimes work hard to get government benefits, Lee said.
 It is not China that is taking over the education authorities; it is the industry, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting university professionals to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. fund its AI efforts.
"I think that those with PhDs in AI should be given green cards automatically", he said.
The State Council of China issued the next National Development Plan for Racial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in the construction industry the same way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of education services is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense created the Artificial Intelligence Center, which should bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the organization of a Selected Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a new project called AI Next.
For NSF, it now invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
On the other hand, the U.S. bill to create a National Defense Intelligence Agency has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a solution to a decades-long dispute between Greece which has blocked its application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a neighboring country called Macedonia, which insists on its neighbor's name and claims to its territory, has blocked its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a new name comparison, but the rival is a capital city and the argument that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's largest Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not contest the election, and the opposition media has again cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the election to be valid.
The question on the nomination paper read: Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement between Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay to follow the adoption of EU and NATO-like policies for Macedonia, one of the leading countries in the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the youth in Macedonia to live as they wish under the protection of the European Union because it means a better life for all of us said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite the unconstitutionality, members of the full parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the election to make it relevant.
The name change would require two-thirds of the majority of the parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of crime at 1 pm.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I want to raise my hand for my children, our situation is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, presidential candidate, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko filed their ballot papers for the nomination in Macedonia for a name change of the country which would open the way for it to join NATO and the Europenan Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
The speaker of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov 54, is preparing a small platform, and taking a seat in front of the parliament building that was set up by those who want to block the election.
We are with NATO and EU, but we want to enter by mountain, not by road Kavadarkov said.
We are a country with no money, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look for others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian mix.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to the necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe most people would like it because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO", Zaev said after finishing his thesis.
He said that the result of Yes would be confidence in our future.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Constitutional Review Authority said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the election - less than the required result.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents organized a mass on Sunday.
Of that, 70 percent said yes.
For the election to be successful, the candidates should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The defeat in the nomination would mark the first major challenge to the government's policy and support for the West since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overtakes all Brighton defenders for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lost to Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He ran in the middle of Brighton's three-point defense, before entering the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by people dressed in green shirts.
He moved one defender before he could get past several others in the Brighton box office.
Then he hit the ball with his left hand, finding Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who kicked it with a leg to pass Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a single shot to the right of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about it for 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League advantage.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored a goal in Brighton's home ground in the match.
He sent a beautiful ball from the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched him a few times before leading Sterling to the post.
The Sky Blues forward hit the ball into the net before it slipped out of the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the first round of the Champions League at 12:55 pm, on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to meet spoiler vs. the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the championship game, there was no way to start over.
But Scherzer's arch rival is hoping to make a run for it on Sunday in a game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a winner's game for the Rockies, who are one game out of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rochies earned at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have a goal, at least we can play knowing that the circle here in Denver is in the crowd and the other teams will be playing the highest level of play at any time I meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals are still waiting to announce a starter for Sunday, but are relying on Scherzer to intervene in the situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, including Thursday's practice, will play on Sunday as his rest day.
The Washington senior is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court, where he spoke about the importance of the Republican leadership in the midterm elections.
All our efforts can be ruined in November.
Five weeks remain before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I don't go out but I do go out so I am everywhere fighting for the very good elected officials, he said.
Trump continued, "You see one of these very bad rebels is the Democrats, you see it happening now.
They are focused on restoring energy by any means possible, you see, to their heart's content, the bad habit.
They don't care who they have wronged, who they have to climb to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, we will not give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a journey to prevent and blockade.
But you have seen over the last four days, he said, that Democrats are called angry, angry, bad and dishonest.
He named the top Democrat Congresswoman Dianne Feinstein of the House Judiciary Committee, which drew a huge outcry from the crowd.
Remember the answer?
Did you open the book?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I thought one - there was that bad show - the worst show I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a dispute over expansion.
He does not approve of people who express their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my local politics shook hands to silence me, it was not a slap.
Look, we are the latest in a line of MPs that Labour has said we will not accept - just for expressing our opinion.
My fellow congresswoman Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was firmly against Semitism.
In my case, the opposition criticised me for rejecting Jeremy Corbyn.
The need for a fair economic policy, national security, and Europe, otherwise the same problems Jeremy had and disagreed with previous presidents.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said that we want the rallies to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP in the region, Friday night GC meetings were usually like that.
And sadly today, it is not the voice of most of the society and politics that is kind, calm and believes that promises are things that have long been forgotten if, indeed, they started from scratch.
It is a very shameful fact that no understanding is accepted in Labour politics, and that any idea is decided if it is acceptable in the Labour government.
This started as soon as Jeremy became the boss, my colleagues, people with whom I thought I shared a common political understanding began to expect me to immediately reverse course and take positions with which I would not agree in any way - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a huge backlash immediately following on from the social media and calls for exclusion, the political criticism of the centre, and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
But I am not alone.
Of course, I know that I am still more popular than some of my colleagues because of the comments they send me that are often political.
I have a vision of the performance and determination of those colleagues who face gender or race criticism every day but don't run.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is how common the harsh criticism has become.
Jeremy Corbyn urged last week that the Labour Party should learn the practice of patience.
The truth is that we are no longer the church of the spread, and no "non-confidence" principle or change in the electoral law, the politics and the ice.
I had a lot of advice over the last two years telling me to sit down, stop talking so much then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I'm about politics to do.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, inspired by the Thatcher government's tourism, which left my classroom in a deep disarray, I have primarily wanted to lead a beautiful social service for those who need it most - whether I was a small regional leader or a government minister.
I had not hidden my political views before, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East should be confused about my legal status and areas of disagreement with the current administration.
For those who supported the bill on Friday, all I can say is that when the country and the Brexit process will have a negative impact on many of our families, businesses and social services, I do not understand the urge to waste time and energy on my support for the Labour leadership.
But the truth is one message I have not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my designers, or Labour members or not: I am content to serve you and promise that no risk of exclusion or political pressure will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr and the unfailing finish
Two late tries have slightly affected the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr should have won today's Tennent's Premiership.
Now at the top of the table, only one team has not won in ten tournaments.
In the end, it was their stronger defense, and their better chances, that got the home crowd, and manager Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have not lost in our games so far, so we are happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: Thanks to Ayr, they took their time better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, completed by Frazier Climo, with Ayr in the lead, gave a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the game, giving Melrose a chance to make up the numbers, but Jason Baggot's attempt failed in the end.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, immediately at half-time, he scored and completed a solitary try to make it 17-5 for Ayr in extra time.
But Melrose started the second round well and Patrick Anderson's try, which Bagoot completed in the lead, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a big time delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off, and at the start of the race, Ayr went out in a Stafford McDowall trial, which Climo completed in the final.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, Melrose made another valuable man out of a failed trial by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the season.
The home team was back, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking Climo out of the penalty box, and MacPherson was behind Ayr's problems.
Climo turned it on, as he did a little later in the first half, as Kyle Rowe caught a shot in the box of David Armstrong and sent teammate Gregor Henry for the team's fifth home try.
The famous Still Game star is looking for a new job in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran wants to enter management after discovering he has been invited to be a director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old made Jack Darvis famous in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-created with comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, meaning Kiernan is ready for life when Craiglang comes to an end.
From the correct records, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The official declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun reporter compared Kiernan to a prospective partner in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.

The harbor from Titicaca to the Amazon is full of sand: The river is ours by nature.
To recover it is a task.
Across the border of Bolivia, the memory of the watershed lost to Chile in the devastating 19th-century environmental crisis still shines brightly - as does the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
Those expectations are perhaps the highest now in a decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the foreign ministry on October 1 after five years of debate.
Bolivia now comes with encouragement, spirit of unity and calm, and with positive expectations of the outcome, said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian ambassador.
Most Bolivians will be watching the ICJ decision on big screens across the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will investigate and interest Bolivia's claim that - after decades of favorable arguments - Chile was forced to negotiate and give Bolivia free access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the attractive Bolivian president - who faces a tough race for re-election next year and next - also has a lot to do with Monday's decision.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he vowed last August.
But some analysts believe the court may not rule in favor of Bolivia - and little will change if they do.
The constitution in the Netherlands has the power to grant Chilean territory, explaining that it will not decide the outcome of any possible cases.
The ICJ decision comes just six months after the final hearing and shows that the case is not a confusion, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean foreign policy expert.
Far from supporting the Bolivian cause, the last four years have been a force for reversal.
The issue of access to the river is one that the current Bolivian administration has taken by force, Zárate said.
Morales's sweet words were compared to the anger that had engulfed every other Chilean, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will also start talking at the same time, but it will be very difficult to have a conversation after this.
The two cities have not exchanged a representative since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, declined to consult and to rush the court's decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia a great opportunity to open a new era of unity between Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used the water issue as political support.
Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision is an opportunity to ensure that we must overcome the past.
North Koreans have said that nuclear testing will not happen unless they trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not be the first to launch a nuclear weapon if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promise at the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be close to resuming nuclear talks that have been stalled for more than three months after Singapore's visit to North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. sanctions and a declaration of an end to the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is very careful to believe the statement while Pyongyang has not taken any clear action on the disaster.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is doubt about the spread and Pyongyang's willingness to deny the country's weapons it may see as the only means of defense.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show show featuring the latest line and a big headdress and a highway coming your way
If you want to lift your helmet or cover yourself from the sun, look elsewhere.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a hazy headband for their SS19 collection at a street art show at Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram is full of amazing hats this summer, but these fashion designers have already sent their amazing products out in a big way.
Valentino's unique hat is a beige cap with a large, feathery cap that covers the models' heads.
Other heavy items include jewelry-covered hats, caps and hats - but they don't keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a mask and a scary taste - he arrived just in time for Halloween.
Most of the beautiful masks had lip-stitched lipstick and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One model looks like a wetsuit with a snorkel and glasses, while another looks like a melted ice cream glass.
But if you continue with the high-profile claim - you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant masks could hit highways near you.
The wide-brimmed hats come directly from the La Bomba pass, a two-step-wide grass hat that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A patent that certified the hat as unsuitable for use posted on social media sent another big production on the way to the show - a huge grassed beach until a model wearing a swimsuit wore it.
A bright orange raffia bag, made of thin raffia and covered with a clean leather handkerchief, is a highlight of Jacquemus' SS19 collection at La Riviera and Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity clothing designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags reach highway for the summer and next - as the designer has had a huge impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for massive supplies.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools set a record for the highest academic performance, but this continued in 2018 with very good test results, which was matched by individual and team achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community efforts.
With a growing student population of 30,000 across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest standards of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for future and higher education, their chosen careers and their status as global citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement a higher education curriculum, we see new languages evolving as they are addressed as well as the subject of electives required in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: If you talk to a man in a language he knows, that's a good thing.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a great reminder that we cannot rely on English when we seek to build relationships and trust between people from other countries.
Starting with the recent test results of this year, we can see that language is ranked on the competition table with the highest qualification score among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received A-levels.
Data, collected from 74 schools participating in SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received A-levels in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German readers, 69 percent of French readers and 63 percent of Spanish readers received A-levels.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill for children and young people to develop in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are seen more and more as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects in free school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Centre for Performance and Skills found that employers were hampered by barriers to filling job vacancies, with 17% attributing to a lack of language skills.
So often, language skills are also a necessary part of preparing young people for their future careers.
With many job opportunities that may involve language skills, these skills are essential in the business world.
Regardless of one's chosen profession, if they learn a second language, they will be greatly benefited in the future by having a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate instantly with people from abroad will put a person in multiple languages in front of his or her immediate audience.
From a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak enough foreign languages to communicate, with French being the only language with a very small percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now essential for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing nations, will continue to support children by providing them with better opportunities and meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will have a different language and curriculum.
Some schools will focus more on new languages, while others will teach languages considered to be of major importance for the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there should be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to creating an educational environment that will always prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
There is no denying in today's business world, that language is still crucial to the future of society, and this should be demonstrated in education.
Of course, a new language should be seen as a foreign communication skill.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, unique and unique for Scotland's youth.
I must do well.
John Edward was Director of the Scottish Free Schools Conference
Lebron will make his first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The darkness is coming to an end for fans waiting to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has said that James will participate in the preseason game on Sunday between the Denver Nuggets and San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is still unknown.
It would be more than one but less than 48, which Walton said the Lakers website is correct.
Lakers news reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James could play minor league ball.
Following the preparations earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game regular season schedule.
I don't need the early games in my current position in my career, to be prepared, he said.
Trump's campaign timeline for West Virginia.
President Donald Trump has opened several political rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five political rallies Trump will hold in the next five weeks, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to support his own nominee for the Supreme Court position open, Trump hopes to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the House when the vote is taken in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling West Virginia campaign rally was rescheduled for 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign online, below from a live video on Youtube.
Trump may be referring to this week's debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been mired in controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct and the expected Congressional confirmation vote has been held up for nearly a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main aim of many of these political parties is to help the Republican Party in the tough November elections and get encouragement.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the next five-week campaign is about getting paid backers and backers, as Republicans try to preserve and expand their grip on the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
Control of the House is crucial to his plan, so that the president will serve as many countries as possible, as we enter a political era Trump's political spokesperson, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
Located at the Wesbanco Wheeling Arena, the nightly political rally is expected to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and has attracted coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican congressional candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is moving in the polls.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will come to promote him in research, said Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases year of fighting to keep hope alive and enter singles on Sunday
After three one-sided races, a four-man race on Saturday afternoon may be the Ryder Cup's requirement.
The power of the propulsion is entirely a game strategy invented but believed by the players, which often misunderstands this type of asymmetry.
So where do they say the power is now?
They went six points and now it's four, so we'll take that as a little encouragement, I think", Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
The European nations have an advantage, of course, four points ahead and the 12 are still beating.
Americans, as Spieth said, felt they had little air in their shoulders and had plenty of incentives, not least the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each would boast three out of four points.
Spieth has been injured since the kick and tie to the wrist and is walking normally.
A loud scream followed as his turn went on, the ball being needed to tie the fourth game after he and Thomas had two moves after two strokes.
That kind of scream met him in the rally that gave them a 15th victory, a pattern that tells you he believes the Americans are not out of this.
"You have to look inside and miss your own game", Spieth said.
It is the only thing that players have now.
18 to mark.
The only players in the game with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup record is undeniable.
The beautiful and unexpected union of Europe is a quarter harmless.
Moliwood was the only tiebreaker on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine o'clock finish on Friday morning.
The punch, and the way their energy moves and comes from the noisy crowd proved to be the players to beat on Sunday, which would have no other great player to lead the European championship as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best to have both at the same time in different openings.
The glory days of Europe were far from over, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson used Sergio Garcia as a team player in the morning football game, when paired with Alex Noren.
One over and two through in nine innings hit the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they could not get out of.
On Sundays, even if no one is helping you out of your hole.
Two-man and four-man football is amazing to watch up close because of the dialogue between the two teams, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy changes instantly.
Europe has played well as a team so far and has been a bright spot until the last day but these four-man team shows that the USA has the ability to fight so much that some, especially the Stateside are questioning the odds.
Europe leads 10-6 and qualifies for Ryder Cup final
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a big advantage after beating the United States 10-6 in the singles and doubles on Saturday.
The two inspired players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over Tiger Woods in the qualifying round, to a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, chasing the trophy they had lost to Hazeline two years earlier, beat the American team in the morning singles match, winning 3-1.
The US had a strong showing in the four-man event, winning two events, but could not reduce the number of wins.
One Jim Furyk needed eight points from a 12-point game on Sunday to retain their cup.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive titles with Molinari, named Molliwood after a special weekend as the pair won their first four Ryder Cup matches by four points.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in the singles, they combined to defeat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by 5&4 scoreless.
Woods, who hung up two shots on Saturday showed his skill in the shot put but has lost 19 of 29 shots in singles and four of seven shots repeatedly.
Justin Rose took a break from the morning's two-man team event, returning to join Henrik Stenson in a four-man match that ended 2&1 to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world number one and third ranked teams respectively.
Europeans did not get as much as they wanted, even on a sunny day in the west of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American flag with two points on Saturday.
They won the 2&1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the singles and came back to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in the singles, having lost in the first two rounds.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point lead in the first round of a playoff, though as cup holders, a Furyk team only needed to bring in a goalie, a goalie to keep their cup.
After they had defeated the second in two days, the attack on Sunday seemed to be too much for them.
North Korea says it will not give up its weapons without consent
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing the ban is creating a distrust in the United States that there is no way their country will give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the international community that the annual General Assembly in North Korea had adopted "Good Over Bad" measures last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging not to destroy nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we did not find any further comment from U,S he said.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no faith and security in our country, and in such a situation, there is no way we can lay down our arms first.
While Ri reversed North Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to undertake a nuclear denuclearisation programme under which North Korea would benefit as it participates in a gradual process, his remarks were significant because he did not immediately denuclearize as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to the statement Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made at the first meeting between the sitting U.S. president and a North Korean official in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to see about the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea wants an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang will first disarm its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insisted on "first nuclear weapons" and increased its commitment to the ban to achieve their goals in a credible manner, and further "declared an end to the war" Ri said.
The realization that the ban will take us off our knees is a dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that progress in prohibition undermines our confidence.
Ri did not comment on the planned second meeting between Kim and Trump announced by the U.S. official at the United Nations that week.
The minister also mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If the parties involved in the disarmament talks were South Korea and not the U.S., the disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not come in this form.
Even so, Ri's tone was a dramatic change from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that a North Korean missile attack on the U.S. capital was impossible, while Vice President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a killing mission.
At this year's United Nations, Trump, who last year had promised "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his determination to pursue a denuclearization program, but said there was still much work to be done and the ban would remain in place until North Korea dismantled its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame set for this, saying  Whether it takes two years, three years or five months- it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should give Pyongyang credit for their actions.
However, U.S. Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions will continue unabated until we achieve complete, lasting nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has jointly promoted a ban on North Korea since 2006, in a bid to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and told him later that he would come to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second session.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming there was no future, only to be rejected by North Korea within hours for passing a similar policy.
North Korea has promised a summit with Moon later this month to dismantle its minefields and nuclear facilities if the United States follows the protocol.
He said Kim told him, "The appropriate solution" he was seeking was Trump's security guarantee to him in Singapore and to continue to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students studying to have a full vacation
The study he found at Harvard University this year made all students sleep less, challenging the tradition of waiting to study all night.
A scholar found that students at the world's first university are often not aware of what is right and come to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, organized the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He got the idea to start the study after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
Later a girl came to me and said: Why am I being told this now, at my age?
He said no one had ever told him the value of sleep - which surprised me. he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explained to the students how the benefits of good sleep habits help in academic and sporting activities, and improve their overall fitness.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of university health services, said the university decided to launch the study after it was found that students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The study lasted an hour and included a discussion program.
In one section there is a bedroom screen, where students roll coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to inform them about the effects of sleep deprivation and sleep deprivation on sports activities, the benefits of sleep schedule programs.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation was associated with increased risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and seizures.
The school map features a conversation icon, and encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We knew that he would not change the students' attitude immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just like having a right to know the health effects of smoking choices", added Professor Czeisler.
The "all night sleep" culture still persists, he said, along with new technology and increasingly restrictive practices for students, meaning that insomnia is a growing problem.
Ensuring that they get enough, quality sleep should be a student's weapon to combat the frustration, fatigue and laziness, he said - even after the introduction, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and biophysics student helped Professor Czeisler organize the study, having taught one class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the study opened his eyes and inspired him to push for this education to be for all schools.
Next, he hopes to ask graduate students to complete a preparatory course before entering the school.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students think about putting on a bedside table, and when they want to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screen exposure and LED lighting, which can disrupt the body's behavior, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal took Gerrard's team
Rangers suffered a painful defeat as Dolly Menga's shot over Steven Gerrard's broken side spread in a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first league title since a 4-1 defeat in February at St Johnstone, but Gerrard's Gary Holt team won their second league title by 18 points as manager with eight points clear of Ladbrokes Premiership rivals Hearts.
Menga scored before seven minutes of half-time, and the Rangers without the motivation didn't look like they would have scored.
With Rangers relegated to the sixth tier, Linvingston moved up to the third tier and are only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
That there could be a future problem for Rangers after the side's Calum Spence was treated for a head injury, after a review from the visitors.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in the side that beat Ayr to advance to the next round of the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, went with a 11 Levi, which had taken Hearts by a single point the week before, and he would have liked his own team to have been stronger and stick with their opponents everywhere.
Rangers may be the best catchers but Livingston is the best with the ball.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first short kick sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGrego's goal, but the midfielder missed his big goal.
Keaghan Jacobs's shot came against goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot from behind.
Rangers gained control but it seems there is more hope than there is confidence as to how they play in the third round.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have scored a penalty in the 15th minute after he scored against Steven Lawless but the Colombian's complaint was ignored by the manager Steven Thomson.
Rangers only tried to come to the post twice in the first half but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not hurt by Lassana Coulibaly's headbutt and Ovie Ejaria's unsound shot.
Since the 34th-minute goal of the Levites was a chance one, no one could say that it was a mere effort.
Also the Rangers couldn't touch Jacob's deep knee.
Scott Arfield had no problem with Declan Gallagher passing the ball to Scott Robinson, who was quiet and chose Menga to take him out.
Gerrard made a late substitution as he replaced Ryan Kent for Coulibaly which made an immediate impact, as Morelos was hit by a side-runner but Kelly's pace was blocked.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play their favourite games, with Lithgow and Halkett playing regular handball.
Holt's side tried to extend their lead in the final minute but McGregor scored and dismissed Jacobs, before Lithgow took a header to knock the ball out of the side.
Rangers representative Glenn Middleton complained of a late penalty as he met Jacobs but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Now a page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Read ... the date of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhem Hans in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that later led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
A long-standing scientific basis, the Geiger counter was later also a new racial basis, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado. Its characters were not as well known as the cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What on earth is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to determine the location of minerals like uranium.
When you turn on this headset, you can hear the atomic effects of radioactivity in the earth's crust.
Evans: It's happening now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name is yet to come.
New seed antibodies may train the immune system to detect damaging cells
New seed antibodies can train the immune system to detect and kill damaged cells
Antiviral therapy trains the immune system to recognize damaging cells as a treatment
The technique involved the production of the immune cells in the patient, and then transformed it into a laboratory
They can detect the protein that is common in many seed diseases, and then reverse it
The test vaccines showed satisfactory results that patients had various seed diseases.
One woman who received the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize damaging cells, saw her ovarian cysts remain infected for more than 18 months.
The technique involved extracting the immune cells from the patient's body, converting them into a HER2 protein, which is common in many genetic diseases, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Maryland, said: Our results show that we have a satisfactory vaccine.
HER2 promotes the growth of many seed diseases, including breast, ovarian, gallbladder and urinary tract infections, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A technique that involves removing the protective cells from the patient's body and teaching them how to detect germ cells has been used to treat a form of osteoporosis.
Kanye West Goes on a Ride with Trump, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After Appearing on SNL
Failed
Kanye West was booed in the club during Saturday Night Live after a tearful performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and his 2020 presidential bid.
After performing her third song that night, Ghost Town's Make America Great, she went on to criticize Democrats and declare her support for Trump.
I have often talked to a white person, and they say: How can you like Trump, he hates black people?
Of course, if I had been affected by the black-hatred culture, I would have left America long ago", he said.
SNL opened the film with a bit of humor starring Matt Damon, as the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the House Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite not being aired, comedian Chris Rock took the West's outrageous film to social media.
It was unclear whether Rock intended to embarrass West with the message.
Again, West told the audience that he had been humiliated in the backyard over his hat.
They said bad things about me in the backyard.
They said, "Don't wear the hat and leave".
They spoke harshly!
And they said again, I was in deep shit", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued. Do you want to see the mystery place? says he's going to wear his superman suit, which means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try the love.
Her remarks prompted shouts from the audience at least twice and SNL staffers acted in disgrace, Variety reports, with one person addressing the letter: "The whole theater fell silent".
West was last seen as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West put a lot of people in confusion about wearing clothes like Kalama Perrier used to hit the song I Love it.
West received support from TPUSA's executive director, Candace Turner, who wrote on twitter: For one of the most spirited: DOWN BUT HOLD THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE.
But theatre critic Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West just be who he is, and this is a beautiful thing.
But I have chosen NOT to give preference to anyone (by buying his music or clothes or promoting his art) who I believe is embracing and expressing a harmful belief in society.
He was free.
So are we, he added.
Before the film, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was "formerly known as Kanye West".
He was not the first actor to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has since replaced Snoop Lion, and fellow rapper Prince, who changed his name to Prince.
A trial for attempted murder for stabbing a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a hotel in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant was expected to appear in the lower court in Belfast on Monday.
The Public Records Office will check the form.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has been fired for his role in a bad man
Kit Harrington is known for his starring role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has shattered the stereotype of heroes, saying that this on-screen acting means that boys have to think they have to be tough before they can get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed "something is wrong" and asked how to combat the workplace crisis of a bad man during the #MeToo movement.
Kit, who is married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she is "very moved" about touching the issue.
Personally, it affects me a lot, now - where have we gone from the role of man?, he said.
What are we teaching boys as they grow up, in the face of the problems we see now?
Kit believes that the cinema has contributed little to the expansion of male dominance, thanks to the male character in the film.
He continues: What is the accepted and taught?
What is it that is taught in the movies, and in the community, that makes boys think they should have sex with men?
I think that's the big question of our time - how do we change it?
Because clearly something is wrong with our boys.
The interview acknowledged that he would not do the opening or ending story of Game of Thrones if the show came to an end next summer, saying that he and the war horse were done.
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's True West action film which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor soon admitted that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this film, so in that way she gave me my future family, and I moved on with my life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character Kit and Jon Snow loved, and won an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China is on a 14% rise in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and hepatitis.
More than 820,000 people in the city have been affected, health officials say.
Around 40,000 new words were spoken in the second and fourth quarters of 2018 alone.
Much of this new language is now transmitted sexually, reflecting a shift in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China due to infected blood.
But the number of HIV infections in this way has fallen to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, in fact, the number of HIV and hepatitis cases has soared by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a hot topic in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexual acts were decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT abuse remains high.
Due to the safety standards of the community, research studies predict that up to 70-90% of gay men will eventually marry.
Many of the infections are transmitted through not having sufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to get a vaccine for HIV as part of its efforts to combat the issue.
Maxine Waters has denied that her employee was the one who leaked data to GOP lawmakers, allegedly saying "bad things" and "prophesying conspiracy".
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that an employee of hers had placed the personal information of three U.S. Republican lawmakers on the Wikipedia lawmaker page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the accusers were ultra-right wing members and website owners.
Say, say, say bad, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released contained home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The message appeared online on Thursday, anonymously posted on Capitol Hill during a Congressional debate over allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The rumor came after Kavanaugh was questioned by three lawmakers.
Privacy sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate claimed that the IP address used to identify the source of the leak was linked to Waters' company, and released information that was confirmed by Waters employee Hill.
"The baseless accusation is completely false and completely hateful", Waters continued.
My employee who has violated his identity, privacy and security because of these fraudulent and false allegations - has no hand in the transmission.
This baseless accusation is completely false and completely hateful.
Waters' statement prompted immediate criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is outrageous", wrote Fleischer.
This means that no such spirit is the Lawgiver.
When they are wrongly accused, they should not be angry.
There is no need for argument.
They should not question the motive of the accuser.
They should be calm and quiet.
It came as Fleischer was reviewing Waters's behavior and the Democratic criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who critics accused of seemingly taking a hard line during Thursday's debate.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to deprive Waters of his seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
Great if true, he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said his company has contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations.
We will see that the perpetrators will be brought to justice, he continued, and they will be held accountable for their harmful and horrific actions against each and every one of my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Again - reviewed by comedy mystery filmmaker Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to look for the importance of Brexit in any new film with a British theme, in this case as it relates to the comedy-drama Johnny English - which was first released in 2003 with Johnny English, and then returned in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Does this mean that the comedy about how we are the dumbest pieces of shit is now our new business opportunity?
After all, the stupid, plastic-faced Johnny English has reversed his ability to promote something secondary - his name more than anything suggests a comic fantasy designed for non-English-speaking parts of the country.
He is actually a secret agent whose yet complicated imitation, with a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and the flirtatious man putting a voice to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It was first based on a travelogue and international secret agent Atkinson made in a forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving a trail of confusion behind.
There is one or two good moments in this new JE.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the plane with his old suit of armor, a hat with a scarf on it.
Atkinson's gift for visual comedy was brilliant, but the humor was weak and over the top, and even the films 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now have a sense of humor in them.
The comedy seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me the Johnny English series lacks a special concept and purpose as the silent film version of Atkinson, the character of Bean.
The main focus now is that Great Britain is in a state of crisis.
An unauthorized internet hackers into Britain's most secretive intelligence network, exposing all active intelligence agents, and confusing active intelligence agents - a minor event for Kelvin Eldon.
It was the last for a troubled, arrogant president who had lost all political support: Emma Thompson tried her hand at a Teresa-May-like program but had no books to work with.
His security advisers told him that since all his secret agents were known, he would bring in a retired agent.
That means Johnny English is a self-proclaimed "spoiler", who is employed as a teacher in a wealthy school, but gives lessons that are not in the book as a secret agent: the character is here, as English gave the secret school School of Rock.
English was sent back to Whitehall for giving instructions to the Bough and his second suicide bomber, Ben Miller, did it again.
Bough has been married, and is linked to a water gunner, an act which the colorful Vicki Pepperdine has made intoxicating.
So Batman and Robin who are always breaking things Her Majesty's Secret Service has also started, meeting Olga Kurylenko as well as Ophelia Bulletova.
After all, the president is falling for the magic of a tech tycoon, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on a journey of their own: disguised as a chef, they light a fire in a French restaurant; they cause a stir by getting into the Volta cruise ship; English causes a stir when he tries to use a Virtual Reality app to identify Volta's room.
The final round was all set up, but there was fun and games, and there was a small children's TV in the whole thing.
Perfection is not a luxury.
As in other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: couldn't British actors give Rowan Atkinson a show that would properly showcase his talents?
Labour denies they are planning to make Britain work four days a week and get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a reform that would see Britons work four days a week and get paid for five.
The group wants CEOs to hand over assets held by employees through artificial intelligence (AI) transformation by giving them a deliberate day off.
It would mean that workers would be given three days a week of benefits and a reduced salary.
The protesters said this idea would be in line with the aims and economic plan of the party to make it more worker friendly.
The Trades Union Congress has proposed introducing a four-day week as the way for workers to get benefits and the economy is changing.
The Labour Party's senior spokesperson told the Sunday Times: The announcement of a predictive analysis is expected before the end of this year.
Not immediately but the four-day workweek is the goal of the union in line with the economic restructuring to suit the workers and the collective productivity of the union.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party pledged a four-day work week during the 2017 political season.
The Labour Party does not support the objective now as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: The four-day workweek is not the policy of this party and is not being considered by this party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference held last week to explain his views on reform and the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he decided to take back control from the unknown CEOs and "high-net-worth earners" in the lifestyle industries.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that shareholders in the water industry may not fully recover their capital, for the Labour government may "make deductions" on the basis of misguided motives.
It also announced plans to put employees on the board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would transfer 10 percent of the shares of private companies to employees, who can receive capital gains of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told 60 minutes if FBI investigation could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final election and his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions that the agency's findings could change the minds of Republican lawmakers and withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could do anything to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I guess, yeah", Kennedy said.
I was told to join the debate, I was told, I spoke to Justice Kavanaugh.
I called him later, and the accusation was clear, saying, "YOU did it?
He is calm, resolute, and unyielding.
Graham's election, however, is over, as has been written.
"I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh, that he will take the charges seriously", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know why but I know this: Brett was very much against it, Graham added, reaching out to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people mentioned believed him.
She was 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What Is the Global Citizen Program, and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring the most amazingly talented line-ups performing, with an equally amazing objective; to end global warming.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people gather in Central Park, not only to celebrate such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, but also to promote awareness of the real goal of ending hunger by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival announced in 2012, is an offshoot of the Global Poverty Project, an international policy advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you prefer to pay for a ticket), attendees will have to perform certain tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to the mayor, making a phone call or any other useful means to raise awareness of their goal of avoiding attendance.
But, how did Global Citizen succeed when they only had 12 years to implement its goals?
The idea of giving people free tickets, is this a valid way to get people to call for a strike, or is it just another way of what's called kliktivizm - people who think they're doing something special by actually signing online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has generated 19 million in sales from its supporters, pushing for the achievement of various goals.
He said these developments have helped international governments to announce commitments and forecasts worth over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group pointed to 390 commitments that had been initiated by its production, at least $10 billion of which had been distributed or calculated.
The same forecast shows that the economic downturn has affected the health of 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the pledges included Power of Nutrition, a partnership with U.K. donors and volunteer providers to help children grow into what they will be, pledging Rwanda $35 million to help them end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With support from the UK Government, donors and foreign governments, and Global Citizens like you, we will make the misguided campaign of malnutrition a message of solidarity. Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman addressed a crowd at a music festival in London in April 2018.
The group said this after 5,000 production units, calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will use the nutrition aid to reach 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the FAQs on his website, asks, "Why do you think we can stop obesity?"
Global Citizen responds: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and give up.
But, as the human rights movement and anti-apartheid movement did before us, we will win, because we are stronger and united.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York, which will be co-hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to prevent Russian energy transfers- Local newspaper
Washington could  if necessary  use its Navy to block Russia's market entry, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has stated, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - famously, where it operates at the urging of legitimate governments - is a subtle way to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they stayed in the Middle East was to trade as much as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe", he said.
But depending on the employee, there are ways to fight it.
The United States can, with our Navy, keep our waterways open, if necessary, close them, to ensure their power is useless. he said.
Zinke told the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit that has positioned itself as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and found that the two were identical.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, depending only, on the leasing and repayment of fuel for cars", he said, referring to Russia as a "competitor" with an economy based on fuel and global waste.
The announcements come as the Trump administration tries to promote the export of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is still cheap for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to pressure Germany to come out against the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump claims is based on the Berlin Wall and Moscow's use of it.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to increase the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just a project for the economy.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strict closure of the plan is solely due to economic reasons and is a poorly planned plan.
"I believe we agree that energy cannot be a tool for recommendation, consumers should choose their supplier", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, following his meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has prompted a strong reaction from Germany, which has also expressed support for the plan.
Germany's governing body for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from European energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow energy pact.
"I am very concerned when the third country focuses on our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said following a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will be watching closely In running for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be "very careful" to run for president, following the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren also announced that he would consider running.
It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which has put women at the top.
After November 6, the presidential election will be highly anticipated.
Warren also spoke out against President Donald Trump during the city's rally, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday Warren said We really need an FBI investigation before the election.
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that many of Warren's election officials did not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' eligible voters said the legislator should not run, based on a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported running for office.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Major Democratic names have spoken out about running for the 2020 election including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his own decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed to PTSD Track Palin at the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Sept.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
What my son is going through, what he is going through in rehab, I can understand other families in terms of the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming home with, he told the crowd at this rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "Friend in the House" and spoke of his son and others who went to war, they came back little different, they came back brave, they came back asking if there was any respect for fellow soldiers, airmen, and anyone in the same army, for what they had given to their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, prevention and reporting of domestic violence and use of a weapon such as a lethal weapon, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 cities, D.C. support the fight against new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that does not provide protection for refugees fleeing violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 cities and districts filed aid claims on Friday in Washington to support a refugee refugee who is awaiting the proposal, NBC News reported.
The full list of plaintiffs in the August Grace v. Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been released.
She said she was abused by her roommate and her sons' gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was incarcerated in Texas.
Civil rights lawyers who support Grace explain that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, account for the highest number of asylum applicants in the U.S., as countries struggle with increasing gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. law overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to allow undocumented immigrants who are domestic violence survivors to apply for asylum for life.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday's announcement that the new policy "ignores the local, state and international laws of the past year".
The Federal Constitution requires that decisions and complaints of any refugees be made on the basis of the evidence and circumstances of the complaint, which in such a case violates the constitutional framework, the filing of aid-related documents states.
Lawyers further argue in their filing that the immigration ban is damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are often independent contractors and provide the contractors needed.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide protection for refugees fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
Asylum protection for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a social group or political opinion, Sessions said in his announcement of the proposal on June 11.
Refugee safety has not been developed to address all the problems - even the most serious problems - facing people worldwide.
Efforts to save survivors of Palu accident continue as death toll rises
For those who have escaped an accident, the situation is even more difficult.
"It's very thought-provoking", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her struggling son to the refugees in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance brings in a dead body.
Clean water is scarce.
They saw villagers returning to their damaged houses, picking up flooded vessels, trying to save whatever they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, are resting in front of the Palu Army Hospital, where the treatment of the injured due to severe earthquake is still ongoing.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how the terrible quake had destroyed the fifth floor of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
Space is no longer our salvation.
I thought I was jumping into a volcano in the sand, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I HEARD my wife cry out for help, then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are well.
US Ambassador accuses China of opposition through media hate
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page U.S. media article on the benefits of U.S.-China trade relations, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media as a bargaining chip.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday pointed to the paid addition of the China Daily to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling local newspaper - after he accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. legislative election on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election reflects what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new trend in Washington's increasingly pro-China stance.
With foreign governments pushing for advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in a growing trade war that has led to them imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's tariffs on grain at the start of the trade war are designed to affect exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. officials said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, emphasizing the opposition by placing ads in our newspapers.
This hate speech, the Chinese government and the American cultural space are being taken away by the democratic and non-violent media by including paid advertising in the Des Moines Register. by Branstad.
But considering the media outlets on the streets of Beijing here, seeing that there is so little controversy that it is hard to see clearly shows the different views that Chinese people may have about the Chinese economic system in crisis, as it is a media outlet controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had refused to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are targeting female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh's impeachment, analysts warn
As many Republican leaders have stood up and spoken out for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of sexual misconduct allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a wave of anger, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment that followed was so high, that many Republicans have reportedly expressed their desire to go ahead with the election.
The materials cannot be recovered, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was questioning the final move by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be enough to quell voter anger.
Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget all tomorrow but November,  Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and community spokesperson for the MoveOn initiative said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched along the Capitol Road as Republicans voted to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"The enthusiasm and spirit of the Democrats will be exceptional", Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst told reporters.
People say it is high; it is true.
But it can be particularly controversial among women without a family living in rural areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 years, who, while disliked by the president, do not vote regularly.
Even before Ford's public statement outlining the sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts speculated that a backlash could follow if Republicans go ahead with the endorsement.
"This has been a disaster for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Convention, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the congressional elections or the last election or whether Kavanaugh is in office, it is also about how the Republicans managed and responded to this, Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a Democratic nominating body, pointed out to reporters.
However, Americans seem divided on who to believe in the outcome of Ford and Kavanaugh's declarations, with the majority siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents agreed with Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they agreed with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably said no or completely no during his confession, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's recommendation, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegations, along with at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the House Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had been drinking to her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his power during a dinner party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web developer plans to launch a new Internet to join Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new initiative by tech giant, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source software, Solid.
Solid gives users the freedom to choose where to store their data and information that is accessible to the public.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was global dominance.
"We will do it now", he said of the new building.
It's time to get on the news.
The app uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to create a online personal database or POD.
It may contain contact lists, event lists, calendars, music albums and personal and work applications.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal databases is that it is up to the user to choose who will receive each message.
The company calls it DATA-based privacy.
The goal of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to have the right companies, equipment, processes and expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company had only Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM-purchased memory, the designers hired to work on the design and the volunteer code assembly.
From this week, technology manufacturers around the world will be able to create their own non-crowded apps using virtual apps on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team is not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they should start or stop the revolution altogether as business models are changing instantly.
We do not accept their permission.
In a publication on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt is to empower business and the environment to help maintain trust and quality and the newly built Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a vocal voice in the debate over internet freedom.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain as the developer and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am very optimistic about the future that has come, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded the Victoria Cross WW1
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier for his country has celebrated his 100th birthday.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a rifle four days later and was awarded the highest military decoration in Britain.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a memorial service in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a very special event" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's great achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in a black cloud and amid heavy shelling from the air and gunfire.
He then ran into the artillery and led the line of fire before firing a single shot at three separate soldiers.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something he knew he would never do but it was humbling.
He and his brother Dr James Vann laid a memorial flower after the ceremony, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he was very happy and honored to be part of the ceremony and said it was a sign of people's support for the heroic efforts.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but got Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 full of people, only to be denied the chance to watch the main event.
The letter from San Jose had 13 wrestlers, including six on the main card and showed him performing all night long in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, the confused UK audience was transformed into Peppa Pig.
Some did not like to stay up late or even early in the morning preparing for the fight.
A Twitter user described the change to the children's show as "not a big joke".
"It is official policy that after 6 am the film is not suitable for children, so they enter the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and advertising at Bellator, when asked about the film's screening.
Peppa the Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their setup to add UK actors in the future.
I think when I think about his gesture, I think we can probably fix it", Coker said.
But it was 6am on Sunday there and we couldn't fix it until our Sunday, their Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when he changed the site, there was so much text going back and forth that it wasn't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical fault.
But no, it is a matter of government.
I promise you that will never happen again.
We will reduce it to five struggles instead of six - as we usually do - and we are trying to fulfill the supporters' needs and get through.
It is a sad state.
Desert Island Discs: It affects Tom Daley as a "bad guy" in terms of sexual orientation
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling bad about himself because of his gender - but that inspired him to be a better person.
The 24-year-old said she didn't realize until she went to high school that not everyone was like her.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs for the first time, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out about the rights of gays and lesbians to give others hope.
He also said that being a father made him not focus on winning the Olympics.
The longtime host, Kirsty Young, has been in a coma for a few months.
Appearing as a rejectionist on Laverne's first program, Daley said it affected her as "an inferior" to others as she grew up due to the "social unacceptability" of gender identity.
"To this day", she says, "the feeling of inadequacy, the feeling of being different, are the things that give me the strength to do well".
She wanted to prove herself, she said, so as not to upset everyone when they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an outspoken LGBT activist, and has taken her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to abolish same-sex marriage.
He said he spoke up because he felt he was blessed to be able to live an open life without any accidents and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - US actor, Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "did it in a ponytail".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years her senior, last year but said the age difference had never mattered.
After a difficult childhood - she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14, her father died of kidney disease three years later - she said it was hard to find a peer her age who had such high and low experience.
The couple fathered a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June - which Daley said changed his outlook.
If you ask me last year, it was all about winning gold.
AND you know, have more than Olympic gold.
My gold is Robbie.
Her son, who shares the same name as her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not believe he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought their tickets for London 2012 - as he wanted to be in front.
I can't tell him that he won't live to see it.
I held her hand to stop breathing and it was only when she really stopped breathing and died that I believed she was not dead, he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
I KNOW this is what I have been dreaming of all my life - to push in the water in front of my home crowd at the Olympic Games, no greater effect", he said.
It sparked her first musical choice - Proud by Heather Small - which was a hit during the Olympics and also shocked her.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was left with a badly fractured seat in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup, but will have to change his style to avoid being a disappointment.
Captain Jim Furyk replaced Mickelson, playing in the once-a-year event for his 12th season, on Saturday for singles and doubles.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as she used to be for the United States, the five-time champion divided her days into a handball and a balance sport in the hope of improving her condition.
Never a smooth hitter even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old man did not fit the Le Golf National's profile, while the long-striking bat did not suffer.
And even if the star is not a threat in himself, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari with a good shot, who has won all four of his matches this week with new partner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, with four points behind, start a 12-round single-game, starting on a hot note, Mickelson's game could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own, not that he had anything else to say.
He chose his job today carefully, slapped me on the back and held my hand and said, he will be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
HE had a strong confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Fame member, and he has contributed a lot to the team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but this is how it turned out and it's how we thought we would go.
He wanted to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It was perhaps his lowest Ryder Cup career finish of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and one draw, although Furyk said his absence caused unexplained problems for the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make people laugh, he is a good person to have in the club rooms, he explained.
I think the younger players were happy to upset him this week, which was nice to see.
It offers more than just playing games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that a big lead could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew from experience that a big lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup could turn into a disaster.
The Dane first appeared at the 1997 games in Valderrama, where the Seven Ballesteros side captained by five points crossed the Americans but were able to cross the finish line only with their nose forward through a small gap, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You have to try to imagine yourself going to Valderrama with a big score; we went to Brookline with a big score, where we lost, and to Valderrama where we won but it was a small score", Bjorn said, after watching the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, with a 10-6 win at Le Golf National.
So history will show me that everyone is the same and this is not over.
You will try harder the next day.
Get out there and do the right thing.
This is not over until you get the mark on the stick.
We had a goal, to try to win this cup, and that was where our eyes were focused.
I've said before that, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the other side - the best players in the world.
Excited by his players' performance on a solid golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to rush into this.
Tomorrow is a different beast.
Tomorrow is one person's party that comes next, and that's a different thing to do.
It's good to have a partner in front of you when things are going well, but when you're alone in front of you, then you're going to be tested as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to athletes, to bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now, leaving your relationship behind will also bring out the best in you.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk's face-off numbers would require his players to do better on their own than with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was in the final of the big day of the tour, after a win in Brookline before being defeated as Europe performed the Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember all his words", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had put his team together on the final day.
We have 12 important games all tomorrow, but it would be nice to start strong as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
When he crosses a line, he makes a big impact on the midfield.
We arrange our lines appropriately and put our own in the shape we like, you know, we try to do magic every morning.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the final, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans at the top of the order.
"I took one of these guys because I thought I had it all", Bjorn said of his one-man color selection.
New German weapons were again shipped
The new frigate was supposed to enter service with the German Navy in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era weaponry that had been depleted of technology, but it won't be there for at least the next year due to poor systems and expensive cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but its launching problems delayed the plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the larger Bremen-class frigates.
It was understood that they would have a very powerful gun head, various aerial and naval missiles and some stealth technology, such as low-altitude radar, infrared and sound compatibility.
Other important tasks included long maintenance times - it should be possible to put the new frigates into service up to two years out of port.
However, all this delay means that the special weapon - which was supposed to give Germany a chance to prove itself abroad - will be obsolete by the time they start working, Die Zelt points out.
The F125 frigate was hit with headlines last year when the German Navy refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy was able to return a ship to its original manufacturer after it had been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media pointed out a number of minor issues software and hardware damage were significant, so that the weapon was useless if exported to war.
The software limitations were critical as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class would be manned by 120 sailors - only half the men who pilot the older Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, it also meant that the ship was too large to operate and prevented the Navy from adding future boosters.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz carried twice the weight of the same class of ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Besides the poor hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of drivers - is also a problem.
It is estimated that €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) of fraud has been committed - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates became more serious because of the early warning of the declining power of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary security council, announced that the Navy was actually running out of ships to deploy.
The official said the issue has increased rapidly in recent times, as older ships have been retired but no replacement ships have been introduced.
He added that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the Navy.
The National Trust pays attention to the secret life of ants
This new study, conducted in a park in the Scottish Highlands, aims to show how the frog feeds on its prey.
The research is expected to add to the light and behavior of these unique mammals to help shape future conservation efforts.
The study by the National Trust for Scotland's scientific researchers will include the famous pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared at Daubenton and Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the park to monitor these activities at all times.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a walk-through scan using a handheld detector.
A sound analysis of the sound quality of all recordings will show how often the bee calls and what each species does.
Map and log will be produced to create a detailed environmental map of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, environmental conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that these results will show the most important habitat areas and how each species uses them.
This information will help make decisions about the best practices for habitat management such as grassland production and how best to conserve tree land for owls and other related species.
The number of mosquitoes in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the past decade.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect sleeping areas and loss of housing.
Wind turbines and lighting can pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical safety devices used in construction, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The eagle certainly did not.
However, because of their nocturnal habits, their ears are more important than their eyes when they are trying to catch prey.
They use echo detection to get rid of obstacles and obstacles in their way of worship.
The NTS, which is responsible for overseeing over 270 old buildings, 38 important farms and 76,000 hectares of land around the city, called the troops vital.
Ten trained fishermen are on a regular basis, searching the berths and occasionally rescuing.
The company has set up Scotland's first dedicated nesting site for the Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of termites.
The park manager, David Thompson, said that the park was the best place for them.
"In Threaves here, we have a beautiful section for the owls", he said.
We have old houses, old trees and all the good houses.
But there is still a lot that is unknown about the frogs, so our work here and in other gardens will help us understand more about what they want to live in.
He also said the need to check for bedbugs before any repairs are made in the yard because it could inadvertently damage a mother-child bed, which could kill up to 400 women and their children, could wipe out the entire population.
And the ants are not considered a crime to kill, torture, or disturb them or to destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scotsman for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called for public support to get involved.
He said: We still have a lot to learn about our species and the many species that we don't know how to count.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German media
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusation.
The Portuguese forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room, in 2009.
He was allegedly paid $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live video after the allegation was announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the story "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a good idea.
Their comments today, a false story, the five-time Ballo d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It was a common occurrence.
They want to be known for using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am happy and healthy", the actor added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called "unacceptable for a media investigation into private life", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would receive a fine of  a fine for breach of the rules at a rate consistent with the damage, which is probably one of the biggest violations of privacy in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After robbing a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's home, where he raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo had committed a robbery after the accusation was made that he was 99%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
The paper claims that Ronaldo believed they were having a sexual relationship but everyone else believed it.
Mayorga also admitted that he had gone to the police and had his injuries photographed in hospital, but later agreed to opt out of the trial due to "revenge" and "protective opinions" for the public abuse.
The 34-year-old said she wanted the case reversed as she still feels the pain of the accusation.
Ronaldo was keen to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crash, and this summer he moved to Italy's top club, Juve, on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will be sad to move on if car manufacturers bury them
The UK would be devastated if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disappointing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Mr Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the possibility of a delay at the border if there is no Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced around 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factories", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers are concerned about leaving the EU without a deal as cross-border business will operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for the sake of clarity, said it would close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest impact on the automotive industry is the risk of a contract being lost.
Production is carried out at Toyota's "Direct Delivery" line, whereby car parts are supplied in 37 minutes from suppliers, both UK and EU for its commercial vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border dispute which manufacturers say could cause delays and car parts shortages.
It is unlikely that Toyota will leave more than a day's worth of product at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, adding that production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "designed to avoid all border checks".
We want to have an agreement.We want to have the best deal that gives us the opportunity as I say, which is not only to get progress now but to also hold this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that a fully successful supply chain should be pursued.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the meantime, they warned that the price increase would reduce its capacity and eventually lead to layoffs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a team manager at the factory, said his team misses him a lot: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: We have put forward a clear and confident plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
The crucial meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein may be postponed to next week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of special operations Robert Mueller who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and the possibility of obtaining a presidential pardon.
But Trump's ouster would have left the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's freedom, fueling Washington's fire and rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken out about swearing in a speech recorder to record Trump's debate on removing the president from the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this story.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid protests that he wanted to get there.
Instead, a meeting between Trump, who is at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosentein but then shortened the hearing to avoid bringing Kavanaugh into the presence of a Congressional jury and one of the women who accused him of domestic violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which extended the time of the Congressional elections.
Trump's campaign writer, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosentein meeting, he said: No date has been set for that, it could be next week, I see that that is back a week because of everything that is happening now in the highest court in the country.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the media informed about what's happening immediately.
Some journalists will draw the line: Sanders hasn't been the White House press secretary since September 10.
Superintendent Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of editorial was due to the TV journalists' disdain for the "high demand for attention", though he said: "I don't really believe they want too much attention".
He compared direct communication between Trump and the media to a rise.
The president has more interview time than any president before him, he said, adding that he did not mention the evidence: "We have looked at the numbers".
Press coverage will happen, Sanders said, but if the media has the opportunity to directly interview the president of the United States, that's better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot, you've seen us do that in the last few weeks, and that will replace the editor when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in interviews or press conferences when there are foreign officials present.
The media alone is rare.
In New York this week the president probably explained why, making appearances that were not good, sometimes bad appearances in front of the press.
Medical Journal writes to EU officials at NHS Scotland about Brexit risks
The Health Register has written a letter to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the community's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months to get the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has offered to cover the cost of the citizenship application for EU citizens in its separate public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the UK-EU border and border dispute has progressed, and a resolution is expected in the near future.
But the UK Government is also reiterating its support for a no-deal scenario.
I know this will be a frustrating time for you.
That is why I want to reiterate now my great respect and appreciation to all employees for their help, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring the experience and expertise needed to extend and improve the quality of healthcare, and help patients and our communities with disabilities.
Scotland is truly your home, and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after he was injured in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, played by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly after the halftime game.
"He came to the side and threw it there", Reed said.
Trainees and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen to the area before placing him in a cradle and brought him back for further testing.
An employee from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no specifics on the nature/degree of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year college student in a red uniform, was in his first year at Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five restraining orders on Saturday before he withdrew from the game, bringing his annual conference tournament to 18 restraining orders.
Foreign businessmen will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy assets in the UK
Foreign businesses will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and use the money raised to help the homeless under the Tory scheme
The move would undermine the progress of Corbyn's campaign to attract voters and grow
Stamp duty will be charged to tax-exempt businesses in the UK
Bank expects to raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign businessmen are to be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - the money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
That would be seen as an attempt to undermine the progress of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract voters and young people by promising more affordable housing and driving out those with higher salaries.
Stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, the above amount will further the Government's efforts to combat the lack of military facilities.
The additional charge - which is in addition to the existing stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago in the second building and the buy-for-lease - could reach three percent.
The Bank expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
It was determined that 13 percent were non-UK residents buying new London properties, which increased the costs and made it harder for first-time buyers to make progress on the housing ladder.
Most of the economic areas of the city - especially the capital - have a "silent countryside" due to the high number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the city.
The new law comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a ban on stamp duty to help young people have their own homes.
He accused the big manufacturers of keeping wealth at high rates by expropriating land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to give up too much on affordable housing to address Britain's housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn has announced a housing reform package and attracted attention, including rent control and an end to evictions.
He also wanted to grant more permission to the council to build new buildings.
Mrs May said: Last year I said I would step down from my government to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
But that meant fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it cannot be good that it is easier for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses as hard-working British residents do.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home is now a near reality, and the plight of homelessness is now a viable option.
Jack Ross: My greatest dream is to manage Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his biggest dream is to be Scotland's leader once.
The Scot, 42, is excited about the fight to bring back the North-East League, who are currently third in League One, three points below the leader.
He visited the Stadium of Light this summer to see St Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
My goal was to play for my country as a professional footballer.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up and visited Scotland and Hampden a lot, with my father as a child, it's something I always go back to.
The opportunity will come, however, if I do well in team management.
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gue Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow the big names to the big club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The progress for me at this stage will be measured by can I bring this team back to the Premier League?
Because of the platforms and the building of the club, it should definitely be in the Premier League, he said.
It is not an easy task to go back there, but I can only feel like I have done well here if I can lead the same way back there.
Ross was only three years into his managerial career, following a brief spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the Hearts staff.
He went on to help Alloa back to third place, and led St Mirren from relegation to Championship Cup glory the following season.
But Ross said he is more confident now than he was during his time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It could be a good combination", he thought, "to take over Alloa".
I really believe that control is a better education for me, than painting.
It seemed bad because I had done well, had a good life, and had some good visions.
But it is not easy.
You have a lot to deal with each week.
I am still going through that in terms of the complexity and the duration of the project but the management is very good.
At first I wanted to do management, now I do it, it gives me the most comfortable feeling, I am myself in my adult life.

The best time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research says
The summer heat has cut costs for British pubs which are failing but has added to the strain on the restaurant business.
One bar saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA business consultancy, which compiled the figures, said: "The sun is still high and England's participation in the World Cup is longer than expected meaning July follows a similar pattern to last June, when bars rose 2.8 per cent, except for the restaurants which had a big drop.
The 1.8 percent drop in hotel sales in June worsened in July.
The most successful bar is one that looks like a restaurant in the background.
Bars and restaurants suffered from the sun, but not as much as those in restaurants.
It was as if people were going out for a drink.
Across these bars, sales of alcohol also rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the entertainment and supervision researcher RSM said: These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The atmosphere and impact of mass festivals or large sporting events are still a big influence when it comes to outdoor markets.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry continues to fail, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent a year will be a major pain in the current debt crisis.
The long summer heat may not be a bad time for food vendors, but time will tell if the moderate temperatures in August will bring some needed rest.
The aggregate sales growth across bars and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a decline in new business launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business analysis company for UK bars, pubs and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from a total of 47 sites, with combined revenues exceeding £9 billion, that's an industry record.
One in five children have a hidden social media account that they have hidden from their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - have a social media account that they have hidden from their parents and teachers, a survey shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagram accounts
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being shared
20% of students said they have a Facebook account to show parents
One in five children - some under 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts - references to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they also use a clean account to show their parents, but also have a secret one.
A mother who went to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw a girl and other children attack her.
The survey, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half believing they had private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: It is alarming that many young people are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the Voice of the Champions and the Chair of the Scottish Champions
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated competitor, and manager Ian Beattle described the injury as a great opportunity for the sport's leadership to take advantage of his over a decade of international broadcasting experience.
Eilidh is highly respected across the Scottish, UK and world competitive scene, we are sure that competitions in Scotland will benefit greatly from having him on board, Beattie said.
Doyle said: I like to work as a voice of competitors, and I hope I can really help and help to lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in the four-man Olympic gold medalist event, is now a BBC pundit, unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: One month ago today I got the paralysis.
Inability to walk.
The doctors said only how long I could recover or how far I could go.
It was a lot of work but I came back strong, learned how to walk again and today I am doing hard work!
Thank you for the message of comfort!
Milk ration ads and discussions of mothers and cows split online
The dairy industry has shared opinions online using social media and comparing mothers with cows and their breasts.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first concealed carry breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie launched a video and music campaign on Tuesday to highlight the new pump's freedom to provide mothers.
Real four mothers danced in a cowshed full of frightened cow's milk with words like: Yes, I breastfeed my milk, but you won't find any tail If you haven't figured out these aren't milk, these are my breasts.
The threat continued: "Rescue her, rescue her, I give small children bread, rescue her, rescue her, my daughters, I give milk".
However, the ad, which has already been posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused an online crisis.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, with many saying it downplays the "danger" of the dairy industry.
Big bad decision to use cows to spread the message of this product.
Like us they will get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that their young are fed enough within a few days after birth, one writer wrote.
Elvie's breast pump hides in the woman's bra and baby care (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: What a terrible fear for both mother and child.
But yes why not use them to spread the message of breastfeeding for mothers who have the time to keep their babies?
Another added: "Even the media is pointless".
Others spoke for the campaign, and one woman believed the fear had made her Tho.
I think this is a very beautiful aloe.
I can buy one if I am breastfeeding.
Redemption made me feel like a cow.
The advert is a bit of a distraction but it is there.
This is a product of great intelligence, one writer.
Another wrote: This is a new ad aimed at mothers who are doing a pump (sometimes at work or in their bathroom) and find themselves asleep.
This is not a publicity stunt or a condemnation of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video one of the women showed that they had been dancing but there was a ransom hidden in their bra.
The perception that supported the ad was based on the perception that the majority of women in breastfeeding said they felt like cows.
The Elvie's Booster is even larger, completely concealed, has a strap or frame and is hidden inside a baby-sitter's bra, giving women time to walk around, hold their baby, and go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner at ECD and Mother also commented: Elvie's Delivery is a great new product that needs to be launched and inspired.
By differentiating between women in child care and cows in dairy production we want to put the dairy pump and all its struggles in focus, and show it a way that is innovative and home-friendly, the feeling of greater freedom that the new pump will bring.
This was not the first time Elvie's ransom caused a stir.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared to have paved the way for designer Marta Jakubowski to use the product.
Hundreds of refugee children head to the Akanka camp on the Texas border
The number of refugee child custody cases has increased and although the monthly border crossing has not changed much, due to strict enforcement and regulations introduced by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to hold children in custody.
Traditionally, most supporters of former refugees themselves have no records, fearing to infringe on their own right to stay in the country by coming forward to rescue a child.
The threat escalated in June, when the central authorities announced that supporters could come and that elders of their other families would hand over fingerprinting, and that their data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency has arrested several people who applied to be advocates for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people are supporters or family members of supporters in the country illegally, many of whom are illegal immigrants.
So we are continuing to chase the people", said Mr. Albence.
To speed up the process, officials introduced a new law that would require some children to be presented to the court within a month of their arrest, rather than the previous standard of 60 days, by the shelter officials.
Most will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to ask for their case to be declared in court before an immigration judge.
Those found to be underage were to be taken away for immediate examination.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to have a violent or violent temper, which can lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape, from the shelter staff and a complaint has surfaced in the system in recent months.
Spokesmen said the ideas are being raised in large buildings like Tornillo, where the lighthouse and child are more vulnerable to being neglected, because of its size.
They added that sending children to the canoe village and not giving them enough time to get their spirits up or to greet their friends could add to the bullying many of them are currently experiencing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, despite the country's eight-year conflict.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign troops were on Syrian soil illegally, under the guise of fighting the defectors, and that they would be treated fairly.
They must leave immediately without any conditions, he told the congregation.
Moualem stressed that the War on Terror is over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed in 2011, while millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue this fight until we expel all Syrian refugees for both terrorists and any illegal presence.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn city.
In a speech for refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return, and blamed the leaders of some western countries for "spreading fear and frustration" that forced refugees to stay longer.
"We have called on foreign bodies and humanitarian organizations to start these repatriations", he said.
They use what should be only humanitarian problems for political purposes.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the invaders to end the fighting.
UN representatives said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in the last remaining strongholds of the militants in Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish decision ended a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, which has a population of 3 million.
Moualem also stressed that the agreement had "definite deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would drive out jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be "eradicated".
UN Secretary Staffan de Mistura is expected to hold the first meetings of the newly formed coalition of government and paramilitary groups to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the conference, saying that the activities of the conference should be restricted to the "examination of the text of the existing constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
In that view, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as most reasonable people might expect, a lack of political will and bad behavior ends his reign early.
The final end of the most terrible president!
Now there is no sign of the tiredness of the inspection.
Since 2014, the highest broadcast-time rating has reached 1.05 million on CNN while it is just short of the 1.6 million mark on MSNBC.
Fox News had the highest prime time viewership at 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has topped the cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
This is the fire that attracts people because it is what we understand, said Neal Baer, the star of ABC's drama Designated Survivor, about the cabinet resignation of the president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another opinion.
He recalled a car ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would compare Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh", she said, "Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a recreational value in the commotion.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the news from Washington will determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, but immigrant families can reconnect and the welfare of the global economy.
Distraction is a luxury that only financially able people can enjoy.
But by now, it's beyond being a smart citizen what happens when you find yourself at 6 o'clock watching a panel of experts argue over Bob Woodward's use of the deep circle head for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin bomb suit (the suit is full of hubris, The Washington Post says) and the release of Stormy Daniels's description of Mr. Trump's ugly body.
I never saw Super Mario the way I saw him before.
"Part of what it does that makes it look like an entertainment show is that it gives you one thing every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Pawn Stars, for the show's Trump and changing artists and daily coverage (fighting the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You should not be a one-sided or one-sided person.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was at 80 degrees and he was on the beach of Kauai's mountain, but he was in the house watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He was unable to get out of the way, not that Brett Kavanaugh wanted to meet the Judicial Conference of Congress and the future of the Supreme Court was in doubt.
I remember when we did all those stupid shows in the old days, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it means they're right.

Excluding spending in toughest midterm election for House
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania and the budget deficit, thanks to the reform of the congressional districts got two incumbents to enter the race for the same seat.
Pittsburg's recent re-election campaign was for Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another race in a special election last spring.
Lamb was also nominated by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which limits most of the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old campuses had been illegally set aside in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th Campaign has started a media fundraising campaign among the main political fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a special election in March that drew a lot of attention for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican held the seat for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the seat by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small step forward.
U.S. Expects to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Stops
The ambassadors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had supported Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled a management team from the Trump Organization.
The State Department decided to recall US diplomatic officials from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for the "recent decision to end support for Taiwan", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development assistance and economic aid.
The comparable penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions to be imposed on the targeted nation, should be devastating for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the domestic protests continued, North American and Central American officials moved to a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigration and travel to the United States.
But before mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the talks to go ahead, and halted any discussion of sanctions for El Salvador immediately.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet the council, now set for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration places on the meetings, the delegates said.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no further strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two ambassadors, who agreed to hold the private chamber debate.
Their report was confirmed by an external auditor, who was close to the administration and spoke in a confidential setting.
Educational Record
The next foot and ankle to be placed may be a complaint by special counsel Robert Mueller for the transplantation of a crown by Mr. Trump, for which there is clear evidence in public records.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's Russian media is connected to his interference in our election.
Congress should change hands, and Mr. Trump will find himself questioning that, as he prepares to go before the electorate again, and perhaps later before the judges of his peers.
That's a lot of power, not that I want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European allies.
There are decisions we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take power away from Hitler, if the West would prevent it and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We fell, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the year of great destruction.
The process of geography and evolution in such a revolutionary, democratic and endless struggle will continue or decrease in time.
Americans are now facing many major changes.
What if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep trouble since the book was published, last year he compared it to recording a secret president and alleged it was bad for the company.
Mr. Rosentein said the Times report was incorrect.
How do we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's plea is not complete or good - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite clear allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?
On top of all that, should we have a midterm election for Congress that would keep Mr. Trump in office?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will be ready for a long period of despair.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of what we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported from Auschwitz by the Nazi regime and had been placed in my place.
He survived, fled to America and, 60 years later, sent me to the Sabbath candle burning on the swastika table.
Or is that my culture, how can I have real hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has high hopes for Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following a beautiful away game in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, would put them in a difficult position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the first league game of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villareal but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to dramatic things.
It is a good score for us because Villareal is a good side, said the 31-year-old.
We entered the game hoping that we could win something and come out with a score.
Maybe we should have won in the final but, in summary, the result was also good.
They seemed better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Thursday was another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game but, the crowd is with us, I am ready that we can go ahead and get a good result.
Last year was very difficult, with all the things that happened and my injury and the change in the same competition itself but there is a good spirit about it now.
The team is good, my boys have their vision; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can also move forward now, put the competitive years behind us and do well.
Women in the fray for fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how much they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they do nothing to address the issue, said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
This is a good place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not communicate your needs early.
Work with your family counselor to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices may be important in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: A financial advisor may also help you to suggest ways to pay for the expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include an existing long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a value-added fund to help you cover these costs or a personal insurance policy with your own funds - if you have the money.
Discuss your legal documents: Resolve legal issues at the right time.
Keep a healthcare proxy ready so that you can assign it to someone you trust to take care of your healthcare and make sure you see professionals who are qualified and interested in you if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider the legal authority for your money.
You would appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
Remember this simple fact: Imagine that your elderly parents have had a medical accident and are on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer for the medications and the things they avoid?
State these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
It's not just about money, but who are her doctors? Martin asked.
What about the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan ahead".
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times while walking home after leaving at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was at Oxford Grove camp in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as "unprovoked".
The victim did not see the victim.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, expecting the death toll to rise.
After the communication lines were opened, relief workers have not been able to receive any information from Donggala administrative area, a mountainous area of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were displaced by the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palau is the main town of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow strait on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a 300 km (180 mi) long administrative region on the western and northern coast of Sulawesi island.
The administrative area, the administrative sub-district, had a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the park, but is more concentrated in Morowali, and the coastal defences of Sulawesi.
Tsunamis have hit Palu and Dongalla several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia lies in the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is frequented by earthquakes and volcanoes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province off northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 cities, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of massive earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and a tsunami erupts violently on the southern coast, killing up to 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits the island of Mentawai, off Sumatra, and a 10-meter-high tsunami destroys much of the country and kills up to 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh, causing damage and chaos and expected to cause widespread damage.
No tsunami was triggered at this time, but collapsed houses killed more than 100 people.
2018: A massive earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake damaged thousands of homes and left some travelers with temporary difficulties.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for allegedly assaulting a man
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, and for allegedly engaging in a violent disorder and preventing arrest, according to a complaint filed by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
At the police's request, when a girlfriend tried to call the police to report a crime, she grabbed her cell phone.
Palin and Ewumewu were arrested before the trial of Mat-Su, and he was held on bail and without security of $500, which was demanded by the KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he described himself as "innocent, indeed" when his appeal was denied, the network reported.
Palin faces a Class A felony, which means she could face up to a year in prison or a $250,000 fine.
He has been charged with a Class B felony, punishable by up to one day in jail or a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first criminal charge against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case was before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with assault, involvement in a crime of violence, and use of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the case.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was reported missing by veterans in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD during his tour of duty in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami earthquake: killed by hundreds
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands upon thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is the eastern and northern part of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media showed the time of the crash.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu after a tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty for suspect in NYC terror attack
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York terror attack that killed eight people -- the most in the state for any civil crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with using a Home Depot loan truck to cause the accident on a bike path along West Highway in Lower Manhattan, and knocking over pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the judges will show that Saipov "kills eight people intentionally and injures several people intentionally", by a willful motion to seek the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, according to the court document.
A week after the attack, a federal jury convicted Saipov of 22 charges including eight counts of cold-blooded murder, which federal prosecutors often use in violent cases, and charges of assault and car damage.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberation", the judges said, and described Saipov's behavior as "depraved, abusive and abusive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, torture, and destruction to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York passed a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of two counts of murder and drug trafficking but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York city trial was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a murdered couple convicted of conspiring to commit treason for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of humanity in the days and months following the attack, court documents show.
He told investigators that he was fine with what he did, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, which the allegation showed.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the city's public defender representing Saipov, said they were "deeply sorry" for the verdict.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence in prison with no possibility of solitary confinement will further increase the fear of the programs for all concerned", Patton said.
A Saipov defense team had earlier asked the judges to stop seeking the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be put at the head of Brexit bill
Nigel Farage promised to rally the mob today during a protest in the Tory parliament.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "get heat" from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs compared her to being at the head of the EU's central bank.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham in the UK that he would "leave" if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's struggle is that reuniting her deeply divided party is a mistake as Remainers join a different anti-Brexit protest in the country.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers deal in place amid the onslaught from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The coalition insisted it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the scandal - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to vote in its package with an "Amparo".
Mr Bone told a Leave Means Leave conference in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He compared that Mr. Farage should be made a member and given responsibility for the central Brussels railway.
If he is in charge, we should go up now, he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: I will stand for Brexit but we should throw out the Chequers.
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: We did not fight the world to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Boone has rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: It is not true that the British have changed their mind and want to stay.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: Just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Many people did not like Chequers, Opposition could not vote for it, our political parties and activists did not like it, who were walking in the streets and saw that we got elected.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, he said: Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage told the assembly that politicians should "get the heat" if they want to back down from the decision made in the 2016 election.
This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political team, he said.
They are trying to avoid Brexit but we are here today to tell them we will not let you go if you do that.
A message to the cheerful crowd added: You want to make our politicians, who are on the verge of breaking Brexit, feel the heat.
We rally the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are once again a free, independent, and dignified United Kingdom.
On the other hand, the Remainers traveled from Birmingham before the convention and spent two hours in the city square.
A small rally of Tory and Brexit supporters has just started this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis complained to the Conservatives about their security problems he suffered by using a party phone as the meeting opened.
There are people who tell us that they have IT systems ready with all the technology for Canada plus plus, for land border and no problem, for free and no land border business in Ireland, he added.
It was a big deal.
There is no such thing as a real Brexit, he added.
Warren strongly supports Clinton for the presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be looking hard to run for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was a key presidential ally of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He has been at the center of controversy over his potential to run for Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting between the community using the hall system since Trump took office.
A person there asked him if he would run for president.
Warren replied it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, but that included a woman at the helm.
Don't get caught in LSU's Sims boxing ring
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help and identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims was shot, 20 times and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound to the head, and died as a result, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, by 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, admitted to being there, armed, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reaches the international championship after team officials handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear at the time that Valtteri Bottas had finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in a Mercedes team decision that would have a major impact on the race.
At the start, Bottas got off to a good start, just a little ahead of Hamilton in the sand as he defended his position in the first two laps and called Vettel to put his teammate to sleep.
Vettel went into the pit first and let Hamilton go into the lockdown at the end of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a leg injury that left the Ferrari driver reluctant to open the pit for fear of overheating after a push to make a third lap.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid, he was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He continued to stay ahead for most of the race as he grabbed his tyre to chase the finish line faster and passed Kimi Raikkonen in fourth.
He finally got into the pit on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace on lap eight with Raikkonen taking fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a very calm guy as I was told.
The team has done a great job to have the first and second place, Hamilton said.
That Was the Most Ugly Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, but said that what was happening in the House showed that people were cruel and unkind and deceitful.
"One thing can happen and the beautiful thing is happening in the last few days in the Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people angry and angry, angry and deceitful", he said.
When you see the launch and the revelation then they say oh, I didn't do it.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember the answer... you opened the book - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I have not".
Well, wait a minute.
We have revealed...No, we have not revealed, he added, the MP's objection.
A letter was sent to Feinstein explaining Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July last year, and was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied the revelations came from his company.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I did not reveal his story", Feinstein told the audience, The Hill reported.
He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret as he asked.
But his denial was not good for the president, who said on Saturday night at the conference: "I'll tell you what, that's terrible language.
He may not have, but that was the worst language I've ever seen.
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was one of three women charged with rape, the president compared the Democrats to using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to restore power by any means possible.
You see the heartbreak, the cruelty, they don't care who they are hurting, who they have to cross to gain power and control, Mediaite claimed the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in their game against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got the two-goal lead in the season with a field goal by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie opened up to put the home run into the game before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard opened for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's double goal scored them the win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's team who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants having won the previous three.
Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford added an assist as Beauvillier extended the lead four minutes later.
In a rough opening period, Sullivan returned the home crowd to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was an assistant for Cownie's 15:16.
Dwyer saw the Giants take the lead into the first period when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side rallied and Bouchard again put them on a level playing field with a big goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the first lead in the league in the second half, and he closed the win with his team's fifth goal in the second half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after a cargo plane landed hundreds of people safely.
More than 800 people died, most of them missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
A massive earthquake continued to hit the area, with most trapped under bushes in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawang Agung was elated to leave his job on the control room floor and wave power at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He insisted that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the way out, be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped from the control room when he thought it was about to land.
She later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision had saved many lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a hospital in another city.
He sadly left us this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are devastated to hear about this", he added.
On the other hand, authorities fear the death toll could reach 1,000 as the local disaster management agency says the Donggala, Sigi and Boutong access roads are blocked.
The number is believed to be still rising as many people are still under threat of extinction without access to majority, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson.
A six-meter high storm has devastated Palu, which is experiencing severe flooding on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute a car crashes and brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
It's cold in the small markets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This has been a disaster, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the local military: I ask you all to work day and night to complete any dig-related work.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year an earthquake struck Indonesia and Lombok killing 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini rescues man after seaplane crash
Air traffic controllers for the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now say one man is missing, after initially saying all 47 passengers and crew on board had been evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon, that it was unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as age or country.
A local boat assisted in rescuing passengers and other crew as the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the event are unclear.
The airmen and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the river just before it hit the road.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the road.
American traveler Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed small.
"That's a great thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others tried to cross the floodwaters and reached the emergency exit of the plane and crashed.
He said that the crew were terrified and screamed, that he had a small head wound.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve the harbor also helped with the rescue by using buoys to get people to the ground before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people died in accidents involving aircraft registered in PNG in the last two decades but it cannot include Air New Guinea.
Investigators show a woman was burned alive at night
A jury halted his trial on Saturday on appeal of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett has long testified as an expert witness in the field of intelligence investigations.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis and Chambers were in the evening of his death, contrary to his last words, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that Chambers used her phone during her alleged visit with her friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the judges asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was scared because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before his death.
Phone records show that the two had known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text, phone calls and voicemails from her phone.
It wiped him out of his life, Hale said.
The three-way contest will begin on Sunday.
The Chief Justice said he expected the case to go to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop genius?
A hip hop trio wanted to change the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with beautiful messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says hip hop has moved away from its natural political message and addressed social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop smart again.
Musicians like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with musicians like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York midwife sues couple for job loss after receiving a letter of discrimination
A New York City nanny sues a couple for firing her because of her race after she received a letter from her mother complaining that she was black again.
The couple denied the allegations, saying the case was "financial failure".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anger when she discovered that the baby-sitter, Giselle Maurice, was black as she approached her first day of work in 2016.
"Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
Nevertheless, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After discovering her guilt, Plasco-Flaxman and the scandal fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their kidnapper, an African-American, had committed a crime and was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for a severance package, and he is seeking a $350 per day severance package for six months, a settlement that previously employed him, despite no written agreement.
I want to show them, look, you can't do that kind of thing", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's racist".
The couple have denied the allegations of being extremist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the right thing to do, and feared they could not trust him after they upset him.
My wife sent him a message that she did not mean.
He was a man of many choices.
We are not racist", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you put your children in the hands of someone you have spoken ill of, even if it was a sin?
Your newborn?
Come and see.
In referring to the case as "financial loss", Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago, and was in a difficult situation.
WOULD you dismiss such a person?
That is not necessarily a good thing to do, the bank official added.
The trial is still ongoing, and the court of public opinion has quickly condemned the couple for public disorder, and criticized them for their behavior and views.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not understand beer and speech, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who received the book immediately after graduation, said of the letter: It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it the first time before it is published.
It's a big laugh now when you know the great good news of Paddington.
Saying that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he was inspired to write the children's book for a small beer toy, would have good hope that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was marked by "sweetness" after his death last year.
Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family", also said that his father was proud of his progress.
He was a gentle man, not a proud man, he said.
But because Paddington is so much older than he is, it's like having a little child accomplished: you feel proud of them even if it's not necessarily your strength.
I think he saw Paddington's progress in that way.
Despite his production and his intentions, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying, and I can only tell her by phone
In the fall her daughter was taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked for free to save her life.
Nad was calling regularly to say that he was in a very bad condition, and was not expected to survive, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad to say that he would die in the next two minutes, I had to tell him so.
I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you, it's in my heart.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication prescribed to keep her alive was a slow shot that would leave her body.
He had already died, and they were all stunned.
I stood there and waited, knowing that everything was going to be all right.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because of the situation I was in surrounded by family and people.
I had to get myself together.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knows", he said.
I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt so sad for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
Women mourn and spread cards to prevent water damage
Two women who have been robbed of their loved ones and work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are handing out cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers from the Welsh waterways where people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
She said I don't want any parents to feel the way I do every day,.
Ms Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son is a chef and promises a bright future.
Everyone knows him for his smile.
They always say that her smile lifts up every room.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was in a very bad place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: I always thought there would be a side effect.
Ms. Davis made the cards, to let people know that there are people here they can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there - you should talk.
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davies, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He said He didn't say he was humble or depressed or anything.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was on the floor on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents and saw nothing.
He said his death was a big shock to them, but they will work together to get over it: He left a hole in the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I think, if we can get something like what he is asking for - a limited investigation, limited investigation - we can bring a little unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the congregation and the etisasi were in a deep political lockdown.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of interest is a matter of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they won't have much leverage in their bid to get their man nominated for the state supreme court.
George W. Bush raises the phone to call Congress, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What would happen when the FBI filed a complaint?
There will be elections in the Congress, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in office.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the lower house of Congress, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to call his own impeachment and put him on the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seun, citing data from the South's Ministry of Communications, said there had been 1,127 breaches last year - down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said land border controls further restricted the border between North Korea and China and high passenger transportation costs were among the reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
Many of the North Korean refugees are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee from China, which has the longest land border between North Korea and is still easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China is seeing the refugees flee as the refugees are outlawed and the refugees are angry and send them back.
Relations between North and South - still at war - have been noticeably improving in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for further talks focused on nuclear weapons.
This came as a major June summit took place between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a broad theme to work together for a Korean landlocked and nuclear-free Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Without trust in the US, there will be no faith in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we can be a consensual one-time way to deploy our weapons, Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", saying he was not mature enough to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he was too angry to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman did such a thing, they would say 'crazy,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied the allegations that he raped Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh's mood was very high, sometimes he wanted to scream but his voice was broken as he spoke about his family and his college years.
He also denounced the Democrats in the assembly explicitly, calling the accusations against him "a brutal, brutal, and unprovoked attack" on the liberal establishment and anger at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed a lack of interest in the Democrats.
He said I think he resigned himself by using those words and by the way he criticized the Clintons and the Democrats,
Pelosi was relieved when asked if she would consider removing Kavanaugh if she was put in office, if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is he not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but you are on the court he is on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a senior judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about Kavanaugh's passing of the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is seen as a credit crunch and a barrier to change.
In his attempt to put him on the bench, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a madman, a fool to go to court and expect us to say, 'If that's not right,'" Pelosi said.
Women Should Use It.
It was a fair criticism, months and months of anger and frustration, and she couldn't say no.
"We cried when we were angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is new, do you?
He continued, I got a lot of help from a woman who is a chairperson at a place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but she learned a technique which means when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I was angry.
Then he would move on.
I thought that was beautiful.
Tears are acceptable as a way to vent anger in part because of its clear-cut meaning.
One of my most cherished memories was at my early work, passing the men's office, where I found myself staring and furious, as an elderly woman pulled me behind my back - a cold manager whom I was somewhat afraid of - who pulled me up the elevator.
Don't let them see you where you are with the bed, he told me.
They don't know how angry you are.
They think you're sad, they'll be happy to have you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked for Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on board the Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, furious, found no reason not to consider running for president herself.
It was not a thoughtful thought, he told me 30 years later.
There are seven other nominees in the race, and they don't want another one.
One person called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because he was late to the advert, he was behind in raising money, so he vowed not to enter the race unless he won $2 million.
It is a battle that will fail.
He found that some of his supporters had given $1000 to men and had given him only $250.
DO you think I could get a discount? he thought.
When he made his speech that he would not launch a full-scale campaign, he was filled with great emotion - thanks to the people who supported him, anger that the system made it very difficult to raise funds and focus on voters rather than representatives, and anger and gender bias - and he took it to heart.
"YOU might think I was very nervous", Ms. Schroeder recalls how the reporters got to know her.
YOU may think that Kleenex is a company that supports me.
I remember wondering, what will be put on my tombstone?
Did he cry?
A US-China trade war may be in Beijing's best interest
The initial onset of the US-China trade war has been a blink of an eye, and as the battle is far from over, the division between the countries could bring Beijing future benefits, experts say.
Donald Trump, US President, first warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese export markets including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most visible stimulus came this week with new tariffs affecting a total of $200 billion (£150 billion) in product value, and tariffs imposed on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly done the same, most recently imposing a 5 to 10 percent tariff on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to embrace the US every step of the way, and the world's second largest economy cannot wait any longer.
To bring down Washington means to agree to the demands, but to publicly challenge the US would be a great embarrassment to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Experts still insist that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war machine could support China in a positive way in the future by reducing the imbalance between the two economies.
 In the event of a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that would trigger economic turmoil in the same two countries remains more dangerous than what observers previously believed, said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, consultants.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was ready for the return of the refugees themselves, and asked for help in rebuilding the city that has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the city is improving.
He said Today the situation on the ground is still good and safe, thanks to the progress made in preventing the outbreak of the pandemic.
The government has continued to rehabilitate the areas damaged by the floods to restore the status quo.
All conditions are now in place for the return of refugees to their homes left behind by the refugees and the economic conditions of the target groups in their livelihoods and professions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the city and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept help in rebuilding the damaged city.
But he also stressed that he will not accept any help or assistance from the countries that support the uprising.
Europe holds the Ryder Cup title in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16:5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The US team has lost six times in a row in Europe, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when a captain Thomas Bjorn of Denmark scored 14.5 points to beat the United States.
US legend Phil Mickelson, who had several problems in the tournament, threw his ball into the water and hit 3-for-16, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed well throughout his career, being a 1-for-4 player to go 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America lost 5-4 to the youngest player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter who had already qualified to play in his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of the Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the most successful European in the tournament, with 25.5 points in his entire career.
I don't usually cry but today I can't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and for agreeing with me.
I was overjoyed and delighted to receive the cup again.
It was for the team, I was happy to be able to help", Garcia said with a spirited voice in the European victory.
He handed the trophy to fellow countryman John Ram who beat US golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I am so proud of myself, to win Tiger Woods, I watched the man grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood has lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 of Ryder Cup tournament record.
The legendary and beloved of one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a way past the exclusion of only Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extremely high golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after the game that it was not good for his team, "I am proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There was a time this morning when we burned Europeans.
We fell.
Thanks to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 musicians played well.
We will reorganize, I will work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Conference, we will move forward.
I loved these 12 men, and I was proud to serve as captain.
You would bow your head.
We won.
Watershed Rehabilitation: Volumes decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decline in the flow of Wildlife for part of the Tampa Bay area.
Through the FWC, flowering conditions are reported in the small rural areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collies - which contribute to the decline in population.
The Blue River flows along a 130-mile stretch of coastline from the Pinellas mountains to the south of the small town of Lee.
Mudslides can be seen about 10 miles upriver in Hillsborough County, but in a few places less than a week ago.
The Blue Water has also been found in Pasco County.
Half of the highs were in or along the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high highs in Hillsborough County, high to high in Manatee County, high to high in or along the coast of Sarasota County, low to high to mid in Charlotte County, high to high and low to high in or along the coast of Lee County, and low to high in or along the coast of Collier County.
Abortion abuse is still reported in the cities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No reports of respiratory distress in the northwestern part of Florida over the past week.
