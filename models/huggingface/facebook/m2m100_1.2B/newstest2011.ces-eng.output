The Church of Prague doesn’t know Voldemort or the bakery.
The new councillors of the capital of ČSSD will need to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old ODS colleagues in the Prague council and in the parliament.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new council from the ČSSD "tested", as they know the notoriously established slang, which in the town hall was created during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The encoded dictionary, which the Prague Political Cream introduced during the previous era of mayor Pavel Béma, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors do not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least he says so.
“Who is Voldemort?”
“I really don’t know.”
“I am a newcomer in Prague politics,” Lukáš Kaucký, the council for culture, responded to the test of the “kmotrovsky” dictionary.
Despite being a political veteran, Karel Březina reacted similarly.
The term “golf hole”.
“It’s the only phrase you give me that I use sometimes.”
“I don’t generally recognize the slang.”
From the dictionary, whose terms the newspaper Aktuálně.cz published this year in June before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously connected with the Prague magistrate.
Socialists were supposed to explain the terms “Voldemort”, “the biggest golf hole in Prague”, “go to a confectionery”, “the bull’s neck”, “the betrayal of the capital” and “the scourge.”
Three of the councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to be the head of Prague education in the future - first promised an interview, but later he did not take the phone.
The fifth minister, Peter Dolínek, rejected the test.
“I don’t deal with these things at all and I won’t judge how the citizens’ Democrats have fun.”
"I am now dealing with how we will understand within our programs," he said.
As has already been said, the council member Lukáš Kaucký would not recognize in the headline above that it is an influential entrepreneur and friend of expressionist Béma Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" does not tell Kauckemu anything and the only term he correctly guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
“That’s Blank’s tunnel,” Kautsky says, adding, “but I know it from the newspapers.”
“I’ll have to pay for a language course,” he jokes.
The golf hole is then as a tunnel Blanka administration decrypts not only matador Karel Březina, but also the council for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plaché is also familiar with where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the expression "go to the confectionery".
"I think it means going to some Prague enterprise," is Shy close to disclosure that it is the headquarters of Janouškovy firms.
He also reminds Březina that he learned from the newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequentants of the test, there is no similar slang vocabulary.
“I also consulted with my colleagues, but it looks like we don’t really have anything like that.”
"We say rather by names, sometimes abbreviations and abbreviations of names are used," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský, whom the parties call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me so," admits Karel Březina.
The name has been tested and works.
Councillor Weinert is for party members Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, deputy Miroslav Poche, who has been alerted to fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has a nickname "Igráček" for some colleagues.
Nominations are also the only thing that Social Democrats admit in their domestic speech.
Hulínský says he does not like to hear Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz recorded another nickname of this Prague president.
"Doctor of Obuškového práva" reminds that Petr Hulínský earned his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", released a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common features.
They belong to the older generation, can’t work for health reasons, are single and have no children.
The witch who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“A man will rarely get this fate.”
"Young healthy women are also not removed because they help work and give birth to children," describes a regular nurse who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, cares in a special home of more than a hundred women whom their community has expelled from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual “social measure.”
She published an information brochure to help curb the witch hunt.
It has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” Die Standard.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, which is neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week after being tortured, poured petrol and burned by three women and two men.
This was by the BBC.
The perpetrators said it was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, the woman was inflamed with oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have burned up after the group wanted to “destroy the evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is encouraged by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devouring of human souls has always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to mitigate the witch hunt, in Gambia, the president himself participated in it last year.
“Gambia’s President Jammi, after his aunt’s death, launched a massive witch hunt, allegedly involved in her death and attempting to kill the president with black magic.”
“He called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president’s personal guard, forcibly drove randomly selected men and women from the Gambia villages to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
In the farm, prisoners had to drink a drug from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
The two inmates did not survive on the farm.
Following international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Inhabitants of Bakalov: Took in the stoves, higher rental signed
An elderly man stepped out of the door of the client center of the RPG company Byty "uhlobaron" Zdeňek Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it a new rental contract for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in prison.
All three of them have raised their rents.
Instead of 3,500 a month, the son will pay from next year for the apartment 2 + 1 second category of SEK 4,100.
“And there’s no hot water and it must be watered by petrama,” the man points his finger in his son’s new contract, which he has full authority to sign.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "uncorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish a guide on how to proceed against them.
But the man has only a hand over it.
“One says it, the other says it,” he said.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments in the Czech Republic still have no rental market.
So I decided to visit the laboratory personally.
Havířovská waiting room RPG is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Next to the door is a security guard and a calling device.
"Rental 2011", a special button lights on its touchscreen.
One tap and a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already tapping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you are on your turn.
An older married couple comes to ask for the rent after a moment, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern the new rent.
Most people come to solve common problems like other times – requests for repairs, insurance incidents, and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts have been sent to the mailboxes of most of the 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments in Ostrava since mid-November.
RPG Apartments in letters to them proposes an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special section for new rentals was opened at the client center on November 18.
“It’s running over a week, so it’s only in progress,” the staff behind the shelf replies after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal’s former mining apartments are a local flammable topic.
Before the elections, the deputy chairman of the parliament and a native of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, took him quite boldly, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
Twenty years later, I want a new floor.
“I didn’t even exchange a plate in the bathroom,” the man relieved at the beginning.
Most of the time, according to the employees, retirees come to see if they will get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half of the discount on the February rental will also be given to the other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
The “deregulatory” barrage of Havířov but questions are definitely not overwhelmed.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients there were only about forty to fifty people because of the rental for 2011," estimates the employees behind the compartment.
RPG proposes individual contract negotiation on the web and its wallpapers where necessary.
However, if the two parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threatening, it's about informing about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG said on its website.
"Nobody will be judged here," says one of the RPG workers of Byty, and a man in the street in front of the client center gives her part of the truth.
"I have a pension of 13,000 and I have five thousand to eat, I don't have to judge myself," he said.
Employees will soon get off.
“We shall see.”
“Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media, let them not sign, so people probably wait,” he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartments, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," reminds Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the neglect of the housing fund, which is accused by the angry tenant, is the main reason for the rental increase, according to the home owners.
In five years from 2005 to 2010, RPG rentals could have invested four billion dollars in apartments, while in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the havířovské waiting room for now repeats several red highlighted information.
"The rental increase in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most about €7.50 per square meter and a month," it will appear on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent will rise by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low sum of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG notes.
The rental will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation will not drive rents to a leap, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rental increase (see graph) will be given back to the apartment, mainly to heat savings - new windows and insulation.
It is preferred to be given to people who sign an agreement to raise the rents.
There is a school building, the architects know.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to also hide a mini-school with everything to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees can visit it.
The project and architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings emerged, had been counting on space for its corporate mini-school from the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly in the baby boom age, and it was important for women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of reduced hours, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers its employees as part of the social program.
Architects and builders have the opportunity to combine a challenging job with caring for a child.
The mini-school was designed by the employees of Arch.Design and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The project is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of SEK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and for two years to ensure qualified personnel and operation.
Upon expiry of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took a year and Economy Rating helped significantly with the application for subsidy.
Care is provided by qualified staff, the children are cared for by a nurse and a teacher of MŠ, so children can go to the kindergarten without age restriction, but most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more are replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program filling in a mini-school is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school bays, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and stressful situations with delayed picking up children from kindergartens far from the workplace of their parents are eliminated.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is not surprising that there is a loyal employee-employee relationship.
Arch.Design has thus ranked among Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program strengthened personnel marketing.
A house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors by Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric donkey, the staircase resembles the dinosaur’s spine, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, the house, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, pieces of stoves and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of shells and ubiquitous soft curves, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí’s secession.
The facade of the house plays dreamy lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When observed in detail, geometry, rhythm and a thoughtful order can be seen.
At night, the entire facade of the home sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is further enhanced.
Forced and twisted shapes appear to the same extent in the interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, fence, decorative elements of doors, cranes and bars.
The Batlló House, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of the 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí.
It was designed by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his designer board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló started the successful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and the Park Güell, in which Gaudí's other works are located.
From the locals, the house soon after completion earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it the "sucking house".
It is also said that on the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculpture elements of the building.
Gaudí designed for his time a unique central heating system with ventilation springs and typical chimneys.
Strange may seem their forty-five degrees slope.
In Gaudí’s creation, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when completing, the city council was overwhelmed by the result and requested rectification.
For example, the construction of the building interfered with the pillar and the public path.
The remedy never occurred, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the call of the municipality, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner moved to the lower floor.
The gallery on the second floor was a social lounge and on the third floor a bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is crossed by stairs, which can be taken up to the roof terrace itself.
The fundamental elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon door and the larger company can communicate comfortably without retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí's reconstruction has also received a non-traditional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which cover the inner courtyard, and lights, is also impressive.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs sunlight.
Casa Batlló, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the building, the most spacious and spacious apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided for this move only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
They persisted in the inspections, as they found that it was a very profitable business, and in addition, the inspections were expanded to include common and loft spaces, including a roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The amount is much more expensive than the entrance fee to Gaudi’s other buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with the dragon towers, you must quickly make friends with some of the inhabitants of the bar and visit him directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a roof: women have different requirements than men
Not the honing frame of the bed, but the quality of the bed area, i.e. the mattress and the roof, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously supplemented in order to suit the specific user.
When choosing a lot of things decides, from the weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and roof are purchased.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend chalets, where they are not regularly washed, latex mattresses are not suitable because they are "warming up" more slowly.
Moreover, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they do not have a lot of aeration channels in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, they retain moisture: mold could also appear underneath them.
The habit also determines the choice.
Anyone who has spent a long time abroad, where a lot of high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they would not sleep here."
"For their crumbling shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such ones are recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they get poorly "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in carved furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers therefore years ago a mattress with lazy foam sought.
"Today it is cool, suitable mattresses have Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don’t have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate the lazy foam.
This “miracle” works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adjusts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won’t turn over at night like after a tough match.
You will sleep better.
The linen foam also acts as a protection against stains.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women with a height of around 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, so together 180 cm.
For separate beds, such as singles, it is recommended to have at least 120 to 140 cm.
For convenience and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly crumbled in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the Cechu of Carpenters and Decorators, who has been dedicated to the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for a number of years and lectures it at professional schools.
For a double bed, each needs its own roof and mattress, but be careful when buying to match the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing but to mount the roofs to different heights, but you may not succeed in each frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a sprinkle skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters should be counted on the shaping and brushing layer.
"When touching your hands or sitting on the mattress, you should definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of roof.
The whole bed, when the mattress and the base are like the grown Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are poorly ventilated, they cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat out 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble a large (and clogged) sitch.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans about the lifetime of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
Everything has its ALE.
Therefore, advice from the practice of dealers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up hygiene and work removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattresses are commonly manufactured throughout the perimeter, so after the breakup we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), however, the manipulation of larger types (and one person) during the shooting may resemble a lightweight match in the ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a solid plate in your bed?
never ever !
Maximum for a bed intended for one night visits.
Nevertheless, provide the plate with (if it does not already have) ventilation holes and use a mattress with a sprinkle skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a cyprus layer.
A polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a base.
The latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-logging lamel routes with 14 to 18 lamels, but you will always pay for routes with a greater number of lamels, 28 or more, where the lamels in the lobe area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
A mattress with a sprinkle skeleton does not belong to the positioning lamel roof, because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the lamels, you can also use the so-called shoulder collar.
It is a special attachment of the lamels, which allows you to press, or even tilt the lamel so that the shoulder of the sleeper is pretty "shut down".
For men who have “shoulders across the whole back”, it’s definitely an important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses already remember it, who in the "man" began to use the softening zone precisely in the area of the shoulders.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate roofs with so-called multitorz roofing.
The pressure disperses into several points and the tension decreases.
However, be careful, once you use the wrong pillow on the right mattress and roof (large and "blown"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips should only interfere with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which is preferred for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should align (together with the shoulder collar of the roof or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original slugs filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least compounds.
The trend is in the mattress as well.
Oil raw materials, from which polyurethane foams are made, are replaced with natural oils, for example, from shrimp and soybeans.
Soya is used by all known producers.
“Bio for mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
You can also use micro-capsules to release the fresh smell of wood or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men are “cooled” by the vegetable extract from breeze so that the mattress can absorb heat and cool the body, women are instead “heated”.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Favorite today?
A mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a violated cellular structure, so it is more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foams and "linny" foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are taken as medical devices.
Gumotex was the first to this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattress and roof is not easy.
Sometimes you can take advantage of the actions of manufacturers or sellers, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam Memory in the coating for SEK 11,990.
The second one can be obtained for free.
The era of lazy or visco-elastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density was launched at a “cosmic” pace by the Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur moulds in heat, but in the cold it hardens.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of slugs, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Visco-elastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the legs, which relieve the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want to monitor their children.
Fear of their own child is bringing more and more people to the idea of monitoring through GPS.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also track the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is so far as a box of sulphur, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the disappearance of Anička and began to search for ways to better protect their children.
At the expense of their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking equipment to the Czech market.
“I admit that in some cases such devices can be misused, for example, when they are put in a bag to someone who doesn’t know about it, but we haven’t encountered such a case yet.”
“Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Children’s psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn’t want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don't want to be under control."
"Great expectations were raised earlier in parents mobile phones, but they can be turned off just like these surveillance devices," Bočková says.
It is also controversial whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
“When it comes to a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics with him that could reveal his location.”
“It’s a phone.”
“When surveillance devices begin to expand, they will search for them as well, because their sales will be supported by massive advertising.”
“In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden pedophile attack.
According to Robert Chech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if a tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to regularly send a location after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last location of the person concerned will be available."
"Dropper devices have built-in náklonometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained immovably lying, the device immediately sends a warning with a position," says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can also be performed by smart phones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to the size of a syrup box or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a danger of loss.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like a regular digital watch are now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a potential aggressor may not be able to recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he will only recognize them after a while and that may give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether tracking devices evolve into bracelets or hooks, they will still use the same technology used to guard cars.
This is a combination of localization using GPS (which is used by conventional autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the car’s current position.
The army has firearms that would cover the Czech Republic, but it will only last two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of ropes to fire the shells.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of wire to the warehouses.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the wires is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought the firearms from STV Group, a. s. for SEK 40 million.
The General Staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of firearms MF DNES, wrote off that soldiers use 60 kilometers of firearms per year during training.
However, from the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, it follows that then all generals, officers of the army command, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intense pyrotechnical training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Picko.
This would justify the military’s annual consumption of sixty kilometers of firearms.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army’s supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each new professional, no more than two meters of fire cord would be enough, as experts say, the army has secured – even with increased consumption of female or special units – stocks for the aforementioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondro personally that they have almost no guns in their hand guns, so shootings are limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
“I don’t even think we’re buying so many fireworks.”
“It’s their decision and they know what they’re going to do.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to satisfy," says Jan Děcký, STV Group business manager.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies the hundreds of kilometers of the rope purchased by the army will have the supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, speaks of only four years of life of the fireworks and police or army pyrotechnicians even only two years.
“With perfect storage, it can be the four,” says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to disclose his name because of military criticism.
After its expiry, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of fire wires.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's supply of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pejšek's spokesman explained.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firing wires by police pyrotechnicians, who dispose of ammunition from the Second World War or the post-Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such amounts to consume this ammunition before its life expires.
It has proven this because of the safety of pyrotechnics, and can more flexibly obtain more modern, and therefore more reliable types of wires.
The Ministry of Defence has already had significant difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to head to the Rhine.
The Czech according to pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, is waiting for the same problem in a couple of years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old fireworks, which today "cheap" purchases.
I am still using the contacts I have gained from the competition.
The winning place in the competition "Livnostnik of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the competition was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad he realized that there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberty.
From savings from foreign brigades and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a semi-destroyed house with five apartments.
The fact that he was a third-year high school student at the time was very courageous.
"The higher ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our country did not allow me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented out to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has successfully opened four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, there was another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrově u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested in the franchise of hotels Pytloun are reporting," says the number one businessman last year.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel was largely attributed to the victory in the contest Živnostnik of the Year," Pytloun said.
The victory brought him greater recognition and popularity in Liberty and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me, and I have to say it was nice,” she recalls.
I highly recommend participating in the competition to anyone who wants to do something.
There is no need to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws from contacts and acquaintances that he might not have otherwise reached.
"With some I met thanks to the competition, I started trading regularly."
The fame associated with success, according to him, also hit every employee a bit.
They are about seventy.
“I see a greater loyalty and pride in them for contributing to something that has gained universal recognition.”
“It’s not just my personal achievement, it’s the result of the good work of all of us together.”
“Only my name is in the forefront,” Lukáš Pytloun says today.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the goal-mindedness of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind.
For the prize for the first place in the last year’s competition Vodafone Firma of the Year, last year in the Slovansk House, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which he built from a small tooling workshop in České Skalici a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and raised our self-confidence for a match against the competition," says today last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered his father Karel Žďársky to rent a small workshop as a compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in the firm where he worked at the time, and with a couple of friends around his father founded a business on plastic baths.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in presses of vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness also among the unprofessional public was received by the company after achieving success in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to see the brand Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners have started to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not just in the mark of the euphoria of victory.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for sales.
The crisis has culminated, which has not so much affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
“Of course, this situation did not avoid us either.”
"The markets fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
Sometimes a business needs to be able to take unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, though smaller than before the crisis.
However, what has not been reduced in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training center from subsidies, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won major awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are increasing, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
Announcements that remove meaningless regulations
The Survey on the Absurdity of the Year is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial poll.
Some unnecessary regulations have already been repealed.
The notorious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" survey became the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
It was approved by more than one-third of the less than 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper statement from the Commercial Register, even though an official could obtain it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, this will change.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a copy of the trade register during checks on insurance payers,” said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Association.
Lighting up all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and those nonsense to cancel is the meaning of the competition Absurdity of the year.
This year, it is the fourth time that it is part of the business event organized by the Economic Newspapers and is enjoying increasing popularity among the public.
If last year there were approximately 3,000 voters, this year there were almost 4,000.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations, which only serve to delay business, are still enough and enough.
"For example, in the number of leasters for tax returns we are at the leading places in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of SMEs and businessmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic was placed in the 74th position in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The "Absurdity of the Year" competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can register for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anticipation" and let the public vote on it during October via the internet on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurd who gets the most votes wins.
This year, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning were submitted to the survey.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also professional unions and journalists.
Among the “finalists” of the competition, among the nominees was, for example, the requirement that cars for the maintenance of motorways and highways pay the toll, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
This year’s list of proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place at the beginning of November at Václavský náměstí in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which regularly involves personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, at this culmination of the competition was assisted by Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Chamber of Economics.
“Economic prosperity can’t work where the state throws businessmen’s heels under their feet, so my goal is to abolish every year at least three dozen paragraphs that now only needlessly complicate business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The attempt to abolish meaningless regulations does not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the business office in the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to a exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by the amendment of the Civil Code.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Employment Office for your foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
Third of all good.
In 2009, physiotherapists were ordered to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two weights in the office.
This year, the Ministry of Health decreed the duty to have a refrigerator.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluate environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year’s fifth annual competition of the Economic Newspapers is entitled “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and promote socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year’s first edition of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Firma of the year 2010 was attended by companies for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would put on a separate article.
Although the objects of their activities differ diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered the common denominators of their endeavors.
In one case, it concerns, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists was the Prague software firm Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubican region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the foundation fund sponsoring disabled children for 17 years.
In turn, the paper company from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of its employees with disabilities, has won the title of Responsible Firm of the Central Czech Region and was ranked third in the competition Vodafone Firma of the Year.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionate reduction in salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for preferential purchases from Czech manufacturers, supporting civic activities in the immediate vicinity and saving the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible, so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
Responsible IT firm Enlogit from Ústeckého kraje, in turn, thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop in its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the Man in Need Foundation, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovarsky region, which contributes to their employees in the form of over-the-counter bonuses for their retirement insurance.
"We give contributions to food, transportation, training and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of Bruntal construction firm Czasch, the winner in Moravskoslezsky region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application were automatically registered and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
False or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"Self-sign up for this competition alone is not possible, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Police arrested in a public competition
The anti-corruption police were arrested in the building of the Land Fund in Plzn in recent days.
The iron detectives deployed the local entrepreneur in the media sphere and real estate trader Luboši G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition gained a specific interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"So far I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offence of pletichy in public procurement and in public procurement," said the head of the Prosecutor's Office of Plzeň Antonie Zelená, saying that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
The 44-year-old man was released after 24 hours.
It is only possible to speculate on how this could have affected the competition, given the minimal amount of official information.
Lubomíra Černá, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said that police were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Plzn during a public competition.
“It was a client, not our employee,” she said.
The public competition is entitled "Call to submit an offer for land transfer claims according to the Land Act" and is held in the event that more than one eligible applicant is interested in the land offered.
"These persons, within the framework of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the proposed claims, the order of acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," a spokeswoman for the Fund explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who applied to the call, and since he himself is also an entitled person, since he has purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested party to the land that he would not participate in the contest.
Probably because of this he gave up.
This would explain that he had such a large amount of money when arrested.
Luboš G. had over-standard contacts on the PF in Plzni already in the past.
He was involved in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land for replacement restitution on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transportation, specifically in the place where the arrival highway to the industrial zone Borská pole was to be built.
Later, they were very advantageously exchanged with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the city had to do so, because otherwise it would have threatened the construction by blocking the land.
Housing costs hundreds per month
From January, households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and steam, heat supply and somewhere rents will increase.
As a result, families will have to withdraw from their wallets up to hundreds of crowns per month from January.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 per cent, gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and in many places also lower central heating supplies.
The cost of electricity in households should be higher annually than today.
At the same time, all major suppliers have reduced power prices, which is due to a significant increase in support for the production of renewable energy, especially photovoltaics.
Gas prices are modest, but at a time when people are heavier and they consume the most.
They also have to pay hundreds of crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are on the rise across the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by local authorities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about SEK 50 per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberty will pay more than SEK 1000 per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened to be more than 9 percent more expensive on water and water, if the city increases the rental from the infrastructure.
If the rental does not change, you will be paid 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the general public comparison.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and steam prices are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rental price can rise significantly in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new rental will bring the company to court.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 apartments could rise by up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whisky stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking ends most often in the care of doctors drunkards, who have not yet been even fifteen years old.
There are no exceptions to children who are being treated from the monkey in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evidenced by the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the revenues of children’s hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Luděk Pelikán, primary of the children's department of Hospital Horovice in the central Czech Republic.
“When they get the bottle out of the closet, it’s whiskey, but fernet and vodka prevail.”
“Vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not feeling so much of it,” explained the primary.
This was by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
It’s usually fernet or rum.
“This is modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools.”
"In some cases, it was a slime they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the primary of Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinking at hospital reception is a relatively common phenomenon.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years at the pediatric department in Motola, where ambulances are carrying undercover schoolchildren from the broad surroundings.
“One girl has been there four times.
“She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought to us with an extra 3.5 per cent of alcohol in the blood combined with ecstasy,” the doctor described a serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Holešovice for a dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't get special at all, that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the primary wondered.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of growing childhood drunkenness.
However, it is not possible to talk about dependence in the real sense of the word, according to experts.
The term “alcoholic” refers to several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena associated with it, and this is not the case in children.
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly tend to have an unfortunate family-social background," Pelikán explained.
According to the spokeswoman Jurin, this year, about forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motola by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who have had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Drunk children who take their parents after an ambulatory treatment, or the police transport them home, are not counted.
In addition to the occasions when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of watermelon, there are three seasonal fluctuations to rely on: witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
“They either drink the mourning of a bad testimony, or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
“But on witches I experienced seven child drunkards at a time at the reception,” Pelikán said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant stroke the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will result in an infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
“They’re actually better off because they have a good awakening after the beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts them.”
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, sometimes spoiling the patient's pleasant mood by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“Sometimes I used it as an educational means, when I calculated directly to those children on the visit, how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make money for that one party,” Pelikán added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not proceed to regression proceedings, in which parents would be recovered from the costs of treatment, in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s of the total five units for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the CASA C-295M transport aircraft flew on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time such machines have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad only for years of training and training.
This is the two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army and which was flight-capable.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
Those are currently being preserved in Aero Vodochody and the intermediary of the store - Omnipol - took them over last week.
When the aircraft will physically dispatch from Vodochod, according to Jana Pejška from the press department of defense is not yet known.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft for the shift were allocated from the long-stayed aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and shape," he said.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft, since the Ministry in May 2009 signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth SEK 200 million for the reconstruction of four unnecessary L-159 aircraft into two two-seat aircraft.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pesek, EADS has committed to bringing the aircraft into the arms of some Allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft will be purchased by EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.”
"It is therefore the customer's matter how this thing will be implemented," Pesek said.
Economic newspapers recently that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for SEK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Ministry of Defence did not submit a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
At the time, the defense leadership argued that the exchange would support future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army has purchased 72 aircraft from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of the aircraft is likely to have a legal effect.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should be selected on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by referring to a single manufacturer.
The Army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which should arrive at Prague’s Kbela airport within fourteen days.
A longer index than a ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index ring longer than the ring are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors, such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and more than 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index on their right hand shorter than the ring.
They had the same risk of developing prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers.
For those who had the index ring longer than the ring, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, compared to 87 percent for men up to the age of 60.
The length ratio of the two fingers – formed during the prenatal period – seems to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that testosterone contributes to the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he knows about this study, but he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer would be "completely proven".
The D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and trails is mostly snowy, road drivers in many places have been driving all night.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov was closed in the morning due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was by the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK).
At 91 km there crashed a truck, at 93 km two trucks collided, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the road.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive directly behind Brno on 190 kilometers or go through Brno and then drive on 182 kilometers on Kývalka.
There are several kilometres of colonies.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, immediately on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a layer of several centimeters of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are formed, for example, in Prosek, is also stuck in Štěrboholska.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trains travel with delays, for example, on the route between Karlovy náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At 8 o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will meet again.
Railways and airports are also in trouble.
Seven high-speed trains were cancelled due to the snow.
Problems are, for example, the track from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport was closed from Wednesday night 11 to five o’clock in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already running, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three side roads, in Brněnsk there are snow tongues, and in Blanensk there are snow chains necessary to overcome some of the roads in the above places.
Among the most affected areas was the Tuscany.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Freezers will need to be installed.
When they will be released, cannot be predicted yet.
Caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are there for the protection of natureined only by inert sink, there is up to five centimeters of snow.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, most in the north of the Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravskoslezsky region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is slowly falling.
U.S. Military Has New Smart Weapon
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a small super-precision gun.
The projectiles are powered by a laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber bullets, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, actually act like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier, behind a wall or in a dungeon.
He is usually not protected from above, and when a murderous rain of steel bars falls on him, it can bring him out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
“A soldier treats it in principle by finding a target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, obtaining a specified point of intent, adjusting the direction according to it and pressing the pipe.”
“Let’s say you measured 543 meters.”
"When you press the trigger, the gun charges and fires the missile to a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be transferred.
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace in July next year from the previous administrative building on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance industry giant announced on Wednesday, in July next year, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the current administrative building on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyon Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the spokesman of Fujist, another 100 jobs of the group, which are currently distributed in the region, should be relocated there in the near future.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and large-space offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the working style of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent negotiator Bernd Wagner said, “In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure.”
Excellent airport connections are very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important enterprise within the region caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurt chief economic rapporteur Markus Frank (CDU) said this managed to gain a "global player".
It is said to be “a fantastic expression of confidence in this location.”
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The company was promptly informed of its intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer maker with the tenant of the property on Marienbader Square.
There were decisive economic reasons.
Now it’s about avoiding a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus Square, which has so far been used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" belonged ten years ago, along with the other buildings on the Marienbader Square, to the most controversial construction plans of the spa city.
Between the railway station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer, the so-called city entrance, which was criticized on the one hand because of the massive construction of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment advisory and rating company Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still affiliated with Siemens, moved to the home.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Fujitsu is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides, for example, computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but most Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Netherlands, with Fujitsu Services and TDS as other subsidiaries in this location.
In the administrative building Astro Park, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the starry landscape, which is twenty years old, there is, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server – threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon has turned off a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened under political pressure after the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depots.
WikiLeaks founder Assange isly in the UK.
WikiLeaks, a disclosure platform, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has urged other countries and to boycott WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the search list by Interpol, is expected to abstain, according to a newspaper post in the UK.
“Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon.”
"Freedom of speech in the country of the free," activists announced by the short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Amazon recently removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing secret diplomatic depots to handle a high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, WikiLeaks explained the move: "Okay - we will now spend our dollars by hiring people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after alleged collaborators of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted a search, CNN on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee has threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian".
“I’d wish Amazon would take this step sooner, given previous disclosures of classified information to WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for a ban on the platform from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, disgracefully and ruthlessly, putting our national security at risk and threatening life on the planet," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, U.S. or foreign, should assist WikiLeaks in their efforts to spread stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the search list by Interpol.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard said it knows the exact location.
The internet activist has always referred to investigations in Sweden as intrigues by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were also threats.
“There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In the United States, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for publishing on WikiLeaks be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, one adviser to the prime minister, Stephen Harper, said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target aircraft".
In the meantime, a shooting broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had asked for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for recent spying calls to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we’re interested in one person’s opinion with websites,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its websites."
The U.S. government is now scrutinizing the security of its databases.
A special envoy has been appointed by Deputy Director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the “necessary structural reforms” that are needed after the publication of reports from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger due to publicity on WikiLeaks.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
Ice Cream University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream bakers are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does this ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly obsolete ice cream maker, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio pulls out the ice cream from the refrigerator, wipes it into the wrapper and sells it.
To find out this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
Those who want to learn more about ice cream will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, a manufacturer of ice cream machines established a ice cream university to make ice cream from its machines match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
About the basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, there is huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream store.
Some are eager in their midlife crisis for a new career, others dare to thin the ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents – from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice cream store in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars – and the Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of a perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also silk softness and good consistency.
Luciano won’t forget the Southern and Patriotic Cherry on the cake during his training: “The Italian Gelato is simply the best – and then there’s a lot of romance.”
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cooles to four degrees.
It then turns the cooker on the machine and leaks out the pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately the docent is overwhelmed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we experiment on ourselves?
Luciano warns, let yourself be carried by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" apparently also used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will crash and the customer will eat the same ice grain.
Certain variations of basic matter are permitted.
It will be more intense with aromatic substances.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
There are also pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force you a lot of aromatized ingredients."
“You should just experiment.”
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream made of white basic matter that turns eggs into yellow cream and cacao as the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now they are able to take part in a course to ice cream machines.
Luciano makes four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lizard ice cream – with or without eggs in base, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pudding – due to the taste it is not always better.
This ice cream may not taste better if it contains more nuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture picked up the proper taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If you use peach pudding with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
A lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano removes a device to determine the sugar content in the fruit (wine makers thus measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only helps the machine for automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that simultaneously blends the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to a minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we cannot avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with a fruit puddle when a huge mixer runs out of his control.
“In any course,” Maestro Luciano thinks, “it’s just a matter of time when something like that will happen.”
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts called Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA’s group of experts on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have signed a contract with the Ilsi lobbying union for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has taken a decisive part in EFSA’s control regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
The regulations of the EFSA are said to coincide in entire paragraphs with the documents of Ilsi and carry a handwriting of the industry, which should be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has raised concerns about the conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior executive from Efsa passed without additions or a transitional period to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta – and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) also recently revealed the EU’s control agency’s staff link with the industrial lobby, which has aroused interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and MEPs.
Meanwhile, EFSA cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, therefore also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
He has to prove them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the U.S.
Self is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics – among other things for estimating the risks of biotechnology without a contract lobbyist.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn will do on the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
“If they don’t look for risks, how could they be found?” asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck is also.
She has studied genetics since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, the industry, as in the US, now also in Europe, is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly any scientists that are not connected to corporations.
Mostly, studies that are critical to companies are not published.
“The industry is controlling security research,” Hilbeck believes.
Footprints of stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is well-known: In September, the bagers arrived and began to strike a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in railway stations.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim lime, a soft thick stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
I secured a few of these pieces.
“These stones are relics.”
“It must not disappear.”
It says, “Easy and poor stone, simple and original.”
When one cut off, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he will do with those pieces, he doesn’t know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the Tübingen forest to the former French army ammunition deposition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all that were created during the overthrow in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they crumbled into a barrel or disappeared in a landfill,” she says in her office, a wooden booth that was previously a watchhouse.
He tells us that he was mocked and threatened when all the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the Northern Wing from a company that carried out the demolition.
But he spoke all days with the S-21 opponents.
He explained that he could not do the demolition.
And when this is already happening, then it is most reasonable if the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it when rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cargo 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest has been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from every corner and pulled away what was in the suitcase and on the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or as the edges of beds with herbs.
“This stone is actually nothing special,” Rongen says.
“If it wasn’t for the politics.”
He moves into his off-road car and takes a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He first studied law, interrupted studies, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
A lover of stones.
There are 40,000 tons of stones.
They are carrying their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest antique stone merchant in the republic.
It brakes.
There is an artistic sandstone in the snow.
“They once belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden,” he says.
The sandstone of Labe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
“My favorite stone.”
We continue on the way up through the forest.
It points to the pile: the red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
and on.
“Good travertine.”
Once they belonged to the squares at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the Stuttgart Police Prefecture, red granite from the Sankt Blasien Temple, tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What a job, what a job, what a job.
When Rongen thinks of how stones were previously broken by hand and carried by simple clutch and bull carriages, he becomes completely reverent.
“It would be a scandal if something like this happened.”
He was not rich, not rich at all.
The stone trader now employs 14 people, and on top of it there are stoneworkers, a sculptor, a forger, a glass maker and a gardener.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who evaluates the remains.
Soon he will be in Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Talent Struggle for High Potential
There are a lot of people at the restaurant.
16 students are pushing for breads with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen have invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of the VW company here they have to talk about the car of the future - and just so, by the way, to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, like VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and become interested in them.
Since universities do not publish any student success lists, companies seek to discover and gain exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to gain talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department distributes blades, rubber bears and plates featuring the VW logo.
It tells hopeful young talents about internship programs, student jobs, and suggests them paths to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: “Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
"VW can simultaneously get to know students, get to know more about interesting candidates and think about who would fit as a collaborator."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
But the news is that he is so openly fighting for students.
“Otherwise, it was a more substantial professional project,” says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from the long crowds of candidates.
They must, on the contrary, strive to attract especially highly qualified workers.
Above all, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the VDI, 40,000 engineering jobs remained unemployed in October.
And according to VDI predictions, the shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
After the audit and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also check out KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will be decided in two rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested people will fly to the United States.
In the struggle for High Potentials in universities will apply, according to Dykty, increasingly tougher laws.
“We want to be different from others with our race.”
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
The talent hunter Dykta seems to be lucky.
"We remained in contact with all participants of a similar event last year."
“Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct access to the campus, small and medium-sized companies are presenting themselves in a classic way in the labor markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“As for example on Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company in Bonn employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
We are aware of the problem with young workers.
Currently, there are 35 positions on the company’s website.
“Today, it’s very difficult to fill the vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiburg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do a practice or write a dissertation with us."
Solar specialists do not arrange any expensive advertising campaigns.
Instead, the company tries to attract with other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Big corporations often can't offer this," says Stübe, head of the personal department.
For a long time, money has not played a major role in finding a job.
Flexible working hours, child care or good prospective options are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks colleagues how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
Stübe, the head of the personal department, hopes that the placement will bring her points to those interested in the job.
"I think that interested parties are informed about the external assessments of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy for a good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means primarily internal measures.
"The best way to become visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees," he says.
This is known as internal employer branding, which means employers are placed on the market within their own employees.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When a company cares well about its people and they identify with the company, then they will themselves advertise to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a rope,” says Kriegler.
Obama to shut down new oil wells
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of the US state of Florida in the coming years.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban—and thus finally revoked the previous plans.
New drilling is also banned off the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
In the face of this disaster, which killed eleven employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow for new drilling in the eastern Gulf.
The aim is to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The focus of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is facing billions of requests.
The commission, commissioned by Obama, is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Several oil companies submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar catastrophe with stricter controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, the supervisory authority is undergoing fundamental reforms, which has been exposed to many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil extracted in the Gulf.
“Government plans are the biggest brake to the growth of the gas and oil industries,” says the current survey by BDO, a consulting firm, ahead of a drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what the regulation will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are pushed up until appeal - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People are fed by theft, corruption and the illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures journalists, "today you will get enough oil mud before the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy browsing his chest with water surrounded by swamps: the scene is almost beautiful in the water gloss with the duck colors.
The fact that under the surface floats brown oil precipitation is not visible.
Previously, she had gathered plenty of garnels in her vessels, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, large amounts of oil were poured out of a broken pipeline into a vast wet area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must wander for at least six hours to get to the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst contaminated areas in the world.
On the way down the river through the mangrove moorings with a lot of side streams, the entire scope of the trigger is only noticeable.
The motor on the boat boils brown flour instead of light water, and whoever plunges his hand into the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves come from the ground like black bars of candy, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain we look for the flocks of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: Once the engine on the boat is silent, there is a terrible silence in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump.
"What is happening here is the ecological conduct of war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in a constant fear for health."
Comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European conquerors arrived here, the first rebellious fight with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was formed here in the 1980s, and Shell was forced to stop production here in 1993 because it was very dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire area of the three-sized Swiss delta is mined daily with more than 5,000 mining drills and 7000 kilometers of pipeline of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area lies in a row, the situation is very unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, steel structures like bizarre sculptures come from the water: "Christmas Tree", so too gently called the heads of drilling holes.
They are 50 years old, most of them rough.
Every moment such a head of the drilling hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil leaks out into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters have leaked into the ecosystem in the Delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil leaked into the sea near Alaska in the crash of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy as to who is responsible for the continuing ecological disaster.
While the Shell group identifies sabotage and organized theft of oil as more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists are talking about cracking drilling heads and loose pipelines as the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, said US scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the amount of failures on the lines is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-spotted workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly linked by a lead, partly arbitrarily scattered across the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gasoline flows from the pipeline to the sewage pot, later, gasoline drops at the end of the pipeline and, finally, diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four 300-litre barrels a day: "We make 34.000 Naira" - about $22.
Inhabitants of the delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in Africa’s largest oil country.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be overtaken by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from the "bunkers" that connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, so in the entire area of the Niger River Delta, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost to the country every day.
But only a negligibly small portion of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the largest portion is filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate about whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax mode of production, activist Akpobari considers to be purely academic.
“If oil companies didn’t see themselves as invaders, and if they didn’t completely destroy the livelihoods of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the company’s departure is considered: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese will prove better.”
Michael is worried.
“It’s time to get rid of it,” says the muscular manufacturer.
“Soldiers can come anytime.
If they were found by a special military unit, they would not face prison, but a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country – like all Nigerians – want to profit from the raw material.
"The damned thing has gotten our land to the bottom in all respects," Akpobari says.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Construction Fault in A380 Engine
The A380 has a major security flaw.
Investigators discovered during the inspection of the machine, which landed in an emergency, a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas has filed lawsuits against engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the Qantas airbus had more luck at the emergency landing in early November than previously known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has discovered a major safety defect in the engines of some A380s during its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction defect.
Per the defect would have severe consequences: cracks could arise on one oil connection due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could lead to a “catastrophic engine failure.”
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which landed in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed the complaint with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts were released and those damaged the carrying surfaces.
Rolls-Royce said the cause of the damage was burning oil.
Around 40 engines will have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security vulnerability was considered sufficiently significant to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s temporary on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Snow will cause chaos in transportation
Germany all in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
On many roads chaos reigns, trains and aircraft connections are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost the entire republic collapsed in the night of Thursday at frosty temperatures with snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there is up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it failed to cope with the new snow.
There was a strong wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) forecasts a storm on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with water conditions 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow rains have caused significant problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to the meteorological agency Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxony Switzerland, the level of violet warning was the highest ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, and strong and fresh winds caused the rain.
There were several passenger cars and trucks there.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt police have major problems on the roads.
On the A2 caused wind and snow slow operation and congestion.
In Durynsk there were problems due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Duryn and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the rails, overturned trees on the rails or broken upper lines and displacements.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Duryn Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers were given wool blankets, food and drinks from firefighters and rescuers on the train.
Snow winds over the roads.
Many flights have been cancelled due to heavy snow.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, there have already been reports of cancelled flights from Munich.
In Frankfurt, more than 40 flights have been cancelled.
Maintenance of roads is constantly underway.
Few passengers remained unconnected at the airport, but there are 400 field beds available for them.
There were many accidents on the roads on Wednesday night.
One truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of the snowed road: also here a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers in the train were injured and the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But meteorologists have good news: snow will remain in the form of light dust, so it will rise even in light winds.
The wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be strong winds.
It will be very cold, up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank Seeks Buyer for Twin Towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers are allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group probably wants the cost of the renovation back again – and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, according to the "Financial Times Deutschland" with reference to a spokesman.
He did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it makes sense to own or sell the property and then rent it again," he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution has recently resigned from its headquarters.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for €272 million from its own fund investors and subsequently renovated them costly.
According to data, the energy transformation has consumed around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts from the industry estimate the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
A spokesman said it has not been decided whether the building will be sold back to the fund’s assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have commemorated the deaths of miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The dead have not yet been rescued, as the security situation in the shelf remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, a powerful explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
Twenty-nine miners aged 17 to 62 were caught in the mine.
The spacecraft was launched to the shale where the accident occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to the high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
Secondly, the powerful detonation, authorities and experts based on the fact that the miners no longer have any chance of survival.
They were not able to rescue the dead.
They now pay tribute to the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
Silence for two minutes.
29 tables were built in honor of the miners, including helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surf boards have found their place here.
On the government buildings were flown flags.
New Zealand hoped that miners would come out of the "deep of the earth" again to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
“But they never came home.”
He can’t say goodbye to his son until he sees his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was plunged into the mine.
In addition to the prime minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also took part in the commemoration.
On November 19, British and South African miners were also attacked.
Rescuers started by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases dissolve, high temperatures will begin to cool inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
In hell, the warriors!
Does the horror fit into the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to overcome the old boundaries again with his combat epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed “Walhalla Rising”?
A captive single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torters and in the big kills almost with supernatural power his opponents - it sounds perfect for young male spectators looking for bloody action, as our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and wrestles his enemies even inside out of his belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as he is actually called, does not say a word during the whole film and the other characters will pronounce no more than one or two sentences or let themselves be drawn to the terrible dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a landscape to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult movie enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It’s good when the film has multiple target groups, it’s just a pity when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to bring his works closer either with more humor to the mainstream or with less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most supporters of art cinema are likely to be discouraged by the everywhere sprinkling brains and interiors.
Fans of action films will get bored at the latest in the moment when One-Eye goes for explicit reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries boat to Jerusalem and remains hanging all eternity in windlessness and fog before apparently sailing to America and there still silent.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into theaters and was now released only on DVD.
It is a shame, mainly because of the beautiful images, but also because behind the peculiar facade, places to shattered blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it’s not about dialogue or a precise plot, it’s all about the atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a movie.
This is not an escape for the spectator.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly stifles him with his frosty footage and cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all, the indescribable hatred that rises from the hearts of the characters.
Only the little blonde boy who helps the One-Eye retains something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed hero, whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and temporary allies warrior from hell, an envoy of the devil.
It depicts destruction, but only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
the experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA has a new warning about the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country refuses to express itself – and will not even allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is named Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as it refers to the reactor allegedly built by Syria with North Korea’s help in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Based on a statement by the U.S.-US Foreign Intelligence Agency (CIA) in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonium – from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, it clarified where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, it is said to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were still submitted photographs that showed the building from close to or even from the inside.
The reactor wasly launched shortly before, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is not much more known than then, even the puzzles have grown over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently stated in his memoirs that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but essentially had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence agents in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “trustworthy.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is of having a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions."
The substrate of the allegedly "unused military building" was quickly cleaned up by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen managed to find traces of uranium that had been produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial dealers from the time shortly after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they are exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - Israel.
The IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
This was denied by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he prohibited auditors from conducting a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been unresulting since June 2008 and “is growing into a serious problem with regard to the agency’s credibility,” as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted – a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter to three additional facilities to be "functionally connected" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated which devices are involved, what their functions are, or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA internally designates them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is likely one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base – precisely for this reason Syria denies IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was that Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the United States to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the device by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images that material has been transported here and there between these three locations and the square near Euphrates.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "connected with fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
But where that uranium came from and where plutonium would later be partitioned into a bomb, there are only probable estimates on these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the debris, which may hide important traces, is stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of freight trucks disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have information about where that stuff went.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar, the salt mine al-Tibni, located on the other side of the Euphrates, which was inspected by Syria in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out ground work on all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months drawing up a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only that effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damascus has also rejected the proposal.
If even a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the matter did not burn, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspection, has already talked about “options that I’m looking forward to in the future,” but has hesitated.
This choice presents great risks: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still nameless film in the summer, there have been problems.
The story is a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Much more is not yet known, but it also causes concern.
It is said that a Muslim woman falls in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the scheduled filming was moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film is currently in post-production in Hungary, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote to UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is also the UN refugee aid organization ambassador.
She is not exactly diplomatic – she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the campsites where rape was committed, love stories did not take place and Jolie's attitude towards the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN refugee organization to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, authorized the filming after a smaller arrest in Sarajevo – it is not clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasizes that in her film she does not pursue any political intentions, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give space to all parties involved.
In terms of content, it remains uncertain.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war began, and they meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp, where he serves as a guard.
What really sounds quite different than “a rape victim falls in love with his torter.”
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war - is true.
Jolie says she is being pressured, which is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now the Hollywood hackers can save her: by illegally publishing her script on the internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This is a good day for the Irish again.
No trace of sorrow.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy at the sound of loud music, throwing their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in Southern Ireland’s Corc boils as players throw tennis balls three meters away into beer cups – and hit each other.
"Beer Pong" is called the bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus and to make tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this crying beer game and a restrained computer scientist do not fit together.
Nevertheless, the 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to reject the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a gambling passion in Las Vegas, he goes to New Zealand for an interview in January.
“I have such a strange feeling,” he says.
“It’s so far away and I don’t have a job.”
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland – “She instantly got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it’s a good sign,” says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the three Tanner brothers and sisters have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: Just like the Tanner, it looks like many families on the island.
Around 100,000 Irish people are expected to leave the country in the foreseeable future, experts from the European Institute for Economic and Social Affairs (ESRI) in Dublin predict.
They expect 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a fundamental loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After decades of upsurge, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis has worsened especially young, educated Irish, who have so far experienced only a rise.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in those years of boom.
Everyone needed it, money was in excess.
Three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.
There are many letters in the Irish Times from readers complaining: “In Ireland, everything goes off the hill.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but whoever can go away and our country loses a generation.”
“Please turn off the last one.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black, because the government is only lying and does not offer young people any prospects for the future.
“They are reducing the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes her classmates moving from one unpaid practitioner to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out by herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers overall service on the topic of working abroad.
“For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galey, but freedom and joy.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues at a construction plant in Germany.
He is building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O’Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra swaps to repay a home loan.
“Situation is sometimes really a little crazy,” she says when she crosses the threshold of her own home for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm basically not."
He laughs awkwardly and walks through cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood withined gardens, large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O’Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for €380,000 – 100% funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
Are you worried that the loan will not go well?
O’Donovan thinks for a moment, pouches a hot tea and says, “I don’t have children to feed and I’m young; even if everything turns out, I can start again.”
The construction engineer doesn’t like the complaints he hears so often now.
“Nobody needs to be hungry – our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island,” he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave an open future and just wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also worked in London for several years, and why shouldn’t New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend as well?
But there’s one more thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday Friday in Dublin.
She is afraid of going to a farewell party.
“No emotions,” he says and drinks a lot of beer.
“Goodbye, it sounds troubling.”
“Let’s call it a celebration of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Crime is worse than unemployment.
And many regions consider Brazil to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the recent Latinobarometer survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in the journal The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can trace changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, dominates two related issues.
The first is that Latin America has a fairly cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering after a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are believed Democrats, which pulls down the regional average (see Graph 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Chart 3).
Approximately 34% said they trust the parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
Support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
But the mood varies in a wide spectrum from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its retired president, Luiza Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and the situation of violent crime has worsened.
Only for the second time since the polls began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Graph 5).
Approximately 31% say they themselves or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease from 38% last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and a market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the area say that private business is essential for development, this percentage increasing from 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable the development of their country, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there support private business), although their leftist president Hugo Chavez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the country leading in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised Elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections meant filling urns and repeated voting, ballots scattered across channels, broken polling stations, and intimidation.
The polling stations opened after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced due to the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed predecessors, shouted it was a scam and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior U.N. official in Haiti, stated that “these were pretty good choices in many respects.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they “do not believe that these irregularities, however severe, did not necessarily cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are due to René Préval, the unpopular retiree president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive match is scheduled for January.
All hope is not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew from their original call to declare the vote invalid.
But the problem can arise if Mr. Célestin, who has little or negligible support among the voters, is identified by the election commission as having achieved a decisive fight.
Due to the widening cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people who still live in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voting would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization they were prevented from doing so.
Approximately 250,000 passports required for voting remained undistributed shortly before the election.
A lot is at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
At the top of the center
In the weeks she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, has benefited from public sympathy when her popularity has risen from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections next year may depend on whether the mourning Ms. Fernández will give up the uncompromisingness of her deceased husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
Everything is based on these signs.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife succeeded in becoming president, had the habit of drawing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Fernandez’s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilized by Mr. Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (at which the government was faced and accused of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to fight,” the president said.
The budget for 2010 will now also apply for next year, with the president having more space to spend according to will.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to be up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions speak of a figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by an economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleansed the INDEC, the statistical agency that began monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernandez now moderate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising global export prices for Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disturbed by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fernández has made known that she wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government created an agreement with bondholders who previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina failed to pay back in 2001.
Now, she faces an agreement with the creditor governments that are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that would resemble the introduction to the INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether Ms. Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, who is tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to silently renounce many of the views her husband has held in politics.
Half incentive for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on November 27 for mayors and city councils in five city districts, which can be considered a wider assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail toward the mainland and have strong implications in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the greatest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Me passed the test, but only tight.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined for a greater independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of votes has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was joined by KMT in the city councils.
The elections took place like most Taiwanese elections, which included noisy electoral trucks and mass gatherings with flags with late-dressed girls.
There was even a mysterious attempted assassination.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien through his face, wounded him and killed a spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, DPP leader Tsai Ing-wen claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on DPP and leads voters toward the KMT.
Per the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates flogged over plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also refrained from raising anti-Chinese positions.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial for Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable for the majority of Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue its commercial bribery, along with its strategy to attract Taiwan back into the herd.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in turn.
I think we should wait until the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, it was at a bad level: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on charges of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a rebellor and a supporter of clear independence.
But under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation has developed that is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was invoked as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for research institutes to serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without pre-conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “credible alternative” to Mr. Ma’s flattering approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry at this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
The ratings of Mr. Ma were bad, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will reorganize its cabinet, as will local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan in establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, “the point from which there is no return has already passed.”
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speaking at the request of the President and the people must be legally noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is referred to as one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a bit late, but it's in line with the Grammy rules, where an artist can't release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" made a step forward, and thanks to her careless vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, func and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy jurors rightly praise the Vijay Iyer Trio album "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a chapping favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" show, has been awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with steampunk knowledge won several well-deserved awards in the big group category, competing with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still daring Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandman.
Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The lead in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A. based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to be awarded.
Classical music nominations are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The classical music producer of the year category has five nominees, namely Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album were won by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the Grammy nominees for contemporary songs are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekko Salonena.
The 30-minute piece is called “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for instrumental performances by a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording the works of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists this year only women were represented, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical transition category, sopranist Jessie Norman won the nomination for her record "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecula receives approval of planning committee
The planned Temecula mosque won unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project that it promotes terrorism and will lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people have come to support this project – Christians, Jews, whoever you remember,” Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
“I am very proud of this as an American citizen.”
“Justice will always win.”
“Opposition is minimal,” he added.
"Those who are opposed only scream loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The talks began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time were discussions with people who were for or against the center.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
“America no longer exists,” one commentary appeared.
“We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty falling into the sand.”
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic Centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the scene of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families suffered in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more convenient space than the warehouse he rented together with a filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24 943-square-foot mosque in Mediterranean-style architecture will also have two minarets and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space for the search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim it is a sign that life has options that stand beyond the main elements that have been considered so far and fundamental.
“This body has a double capacity.”
"It can grow either thanks to phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not proof that it’s a form of truly ‘extraterrestrial’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online issue of Science.
For a long time it has been considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced with arsenic.
“You’ll start to be surprised at what’s still possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life outside of Earth, as researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life might look, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report about this newcomer published to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
is not so.
The discovery “shows that other planetary organisms may be able to take advantage of other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider ‘standard’ may not be so absolutely necessary for life,” explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a coincidental finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiology Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so it was considered that a microbe exposed to both elements could be able to replace one by another.
“Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus.”
“As a result, it is very difficult for organisms to separate these elements from each other.”
"H, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work like phosphorus.When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to rising concentrations of arsenic, which are bacteria capable of adapting and growing.
Microbes grow better under the action of phosphorus, but since they can survive with arsenic replacement, there is an increased chance that life forms that use arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic replacing phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example to prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simons research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs someone stole from the Bellflower motel have been found, the Los Angeles Sheriff said on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two akites and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs later on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles police department.
“The good news is that the dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They were handed over to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, and did not share detailed information about their finding.
“The investigation continues.”
“We don’t want to talk about it,” Whitmore said.
“We follow the rules.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught to comment on the case.
They were delighted when, on Wednesday afternoon, their two akites were found in a shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog named Trace and a 10-month-old dog named Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds, who had planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were scheduled to compete in further competitions scheduled in the days ahead of the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a couple’s month-long trip to dog shows.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the window of their rooms.
They also took three dogs with them - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Bretagne oak dog - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows so that the dogs had plenty of fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard the car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who leads them to the missing dogs.
On Thursday it was not clear whether the prizes would be awarded.
The Lion is again ready to scream now that the MGM restructuring gets final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again.
The federal insolvency judge of New York on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packed" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt to clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, MGM has no legal obstacles to reboot Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief executives of the leaned studio.
The number of employees will be reduced to approximately 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned funding resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance MGM’s new operations and production.
Now it is a connection with an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and financing is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to settle its finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and sales expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and the 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the financing required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a reward for success, a so-called “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the financing of two films, the prequel of which will be The Hobbit, in conjunction with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, sought the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology toys to keep your gift budget in balance
The top candidate this year is the most amazing toy iPad, followed by a video game system.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beads or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy dealers – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law worked; this year’s technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with affiliated sites have appeared, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are toys with charging batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, unless stated otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are plush animals that sing when you press their belly.
At one press, the animal gives a tone and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start cuddling, you can’t stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14 inch animated doll from Elmo Live technology that can play the Simon Says game and can also walk the moon thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel-blocking.
Kids are testing the Mickey Dance Instructor toy, even though their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you’re a child in the 80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn driving into fun with a self-repair, funny workbook.
If you’re looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest, easy-to-use variant, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don’t have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major change to Leapster from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows family photos to be viewed.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubits not larger than a box of light bulbs, each of which has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before time runs out; this is great for competing in improvised wordmaking.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
At the highest level, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, a wheeled skateboard or a puffle animal.
A little bit larger than the brush of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years old), the latest in the range of microrobots with a button battery.
The shrimp moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It’s fun when you make a labyrinth of cubes and watch if he manages to find a way out.
He is also very resilient.
Our one was able to fall from the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Increased police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders, and issuing orders in half a voice with the military authority.
He wanted female female members—China’s prominent city law enforcers, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and violence—to give a certain impression to a bunch of passers.
“Stand up straight!”
“Hurry up!”
Show them, whispering quietly, “how beautiful girls look!”
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood on guard.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to the ruler.
Four head coverings perfectly fit on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white strips.
“I personally think they look average,” said Mr. Tang dismissively.
“The models are nice.”
More than one government has been trying to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city ordered that the new goalkeepers had higher education.
Guangdong Province has changed the grey-green uniforms to the allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the blatant views with a strong armament: in 2009 one report that 50 officers were steadfastly surrounding the snack wheelchair and staring at the owner until the underground dealer packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen surgery as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women, who were selected specifically according to their appearance, temperament and young age.
The goal is to show the police’s more subtle, feminine side, in addition to the rough side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media typically captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei strangled an unaccompanied spectator to death after using his mobile phone to shoot as they acted during a protest against the landfill.
Last year there was a training for police officers in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet.
This year, an undercover melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
A violent video game that can be downloaded on the internet shows Chinese police as they attack street dealers.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, a national edition, complained last year after further discussions about tactics.
On paper it was “really thoroughly cleaned.”
Skeptics say that this approach is not enough.
After the district announced an interest in eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real duties or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and “five facial features in the right proportion.”
The height of the adept should be higher than the average – higher than 1.6 meters.
Working at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials argue that work is mentally too difficult for women over the age of 25.
“Their image is an important thing,” one nameless police officer told Rednet.com, as if a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the series of nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of district city management, disagrees very much with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are common in China for other jobs, both genders.
As well as the requirement for proportional features of the face.
That means that the question of good sight is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will not apply.
“He can’t allow a crude or thin man to serve us,” said Mr. Zheng.
“His image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who holds a patrol on Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?” she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, “Our job is to represent the image of the city.”
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just chasing merchants into the streets where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, a group stands up against more than a dozen marketers who run on foot or on bikes and try to sell as many knobs and cups of tofu as possible before they are expelled.
“Wang, you have to go.”
"We've told you this many times!" said Miss Xu, as the marketer began to run away, and left his bike with a cart of nuts for a while.
Police describe their duties as more monotonous than tough.
“Every day is basically the same,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her freelance marketing.
“Great routine.”
One reason is that female police officers do not have the same powers as their male counterparts in order to seize goods.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that police killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers or police officers were injured during the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
Peace is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police seized the motorcycle, which was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner could cry as much as he wanted.
A 15-minute distance in front of the policemen, facing angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
“Sometimes we struggle verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” said Mr. Li materially.
“It’s mostly the public who starts it.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure lobbying, Senator's lawyers said on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who was, until the time of the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for president for 2012.
Mr. Ensigna’s office said he was “certainly pleased” with the decision that followed almost a year of investigation.
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department “informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that it is not planned to raise further charges against him in this matter.”
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who claimed there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews cite.
Since Hampton was a recent assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was banned from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the ban on lobbying.
The evidence that was released “revealed that it was a clear case of preparing a breach of the law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the Senator Ensign case decision, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said the ministry is cautious about political charges, following a large number of failures, including last year’s decision to suspend a lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of prosecution misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “clearly hid the weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a lawyer group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
“This essentially indicates that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensigna’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that the prosecutor of the Justice Department called him on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensigna’s defense team is working with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “has acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he forwarded to the prosecutors.
"It's not pleasant for me to describe the details of my discussions with the Justice Department other than that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt the investigation of a separate complaint in which the ethics group alleged that Ensign's parents' payment to Hampton in the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensigna’s chief employee – John Lopez – communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him he was “bucking” into the Ministry of the Interior about the subject being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton to work as a lobbyist.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and close the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her diligent work on behalf of the Nevadese people," she said.
Cheshire Community Challenge Goes to Twitter
There were half a dozen in the courtroom.
Minute by minute they were sending news of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages dealt with raping and bounding children to beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, a trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, took place, and an official end to the imposition of the death penalty, which the jury voted for, was to take place.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already appealed to the court with claims and arguments that the court would likely employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process — including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters — created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then misled the jury in making decisions in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether, with the emergence of new technologies, it would also require new rules in the courtroom.
“As I experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies in the courtroom will affect the rights of individuals to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’s chief advocate.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the state’s Supreme Court briefly rejected claims regarding the last week’s ruling that the media had been “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence to indicate that the jury acted under public influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in his ruling that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was a “carnival atmosphere” due to the media.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the television show and the film "Refugee".
Some lawyers said the courts of appeal, which reviewed Hayes’s verdict half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be needed to determine how to communicate from court halls, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly-tracked cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting direct communication from court halls can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of the many lawyers described by Mr. Hayes who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
Advocates also argue that Mr. Hayes may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrifying criminal photographs when selecting the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were shocked by the photos of the victims made by Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Lawyers say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury who was critical of the prosecutors and wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury was not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scale of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict raised last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the governor candidates and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly blowing up flames of emotions on the subject of the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that hasn't been seen here in New Haven so far and is also a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later reports, and in their view, the judicial police should control the scope of further proceedings.
But some lawyers have sought appeal courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling in the case of Dr. Sheppard, due to the breadth of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can courtesy overcome the gap?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its insult and negativism, a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first glimpse of a genuine cooperation between the two political parties, or is it just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders brought no fundamental discoveries on key topics to be discussed during the session.
In any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences of views between the two sides, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party agitation.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over several months has built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides members.
It is hard to say that a new era has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period – they’re searching each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday hearing and its subsequent evaluation by the participants was also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too vast and too profound to suggest a rapid change in the situation that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s a matter of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections sparked the emotions of the parties and they then silenced.
It is good.”
In a few issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts ended at the end of the year and nobody considers it favorable.
Both parties want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Similar to a likely compromise on unemployment benefits just because Republicans can’t look at how they’re advocating tax cuts for the wealthy while rejecting unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday’s talks in the White House, there is already greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful collaboration on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened for January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that have to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism—which is largely widespread—to the fact that politeness will lead them to real collaboration.
“I look at everything between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012,” he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act according to their promises and have to cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These supportive lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include a tax code reform and increases in some taxes, increases in retirement age and cuts in spending.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, put pressure on the issue of deficit to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials in the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial matters, at least today, we have little foundation or will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to deal with budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the move?
Public opinion .
There is a lot of evidence that despite the partyism at the recent elections, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it is possible to move to the heels, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very attentive to the reaction of the public.
Anyone will be threatened with a reduction in votes, will likely change the course and will seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of the matter.
Partialism and orientation are bigger today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the politeness that appeared this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
It will cost much effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
U.S. document describes Moscow as a shelter for corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the “kleptocracy” and it continues part of the bribery and bribery for protection that comes along the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in records from February.
Police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They are collecting money not only from legitimate but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of the office” – will take its own when money starts moving upstairs.
The recording, which was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was removed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, for many years have constantly denied allegations of corruption, and won several lawsuits for false charges for such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about proven testimony about corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's shit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will be shown by voting.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details spoken in such a way, namely in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of that foreign diplomats would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its associations with criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more like a kleptocracy than a government," the report says.
“The criminal elements enjoy the so-called ‘krysha’ (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor’s Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police is targeting smaller.
One source said, “Moscow store owners realize that it’s better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Internal Affairs (rather than from organized criminal groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“Because of this, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course.”
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself may already have trouble; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay quickly enough, their shops are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team, in a recent interview.
“It’s part of the bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no longer political classes.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (country ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy’s report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, did not arouse the Russian government’s enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue about the solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents published by WikiLeaks could be fake and reacted angrily to statements that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev’s Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it's about our mutual interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethically.”
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a well-lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves that Moka.”
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "Massaker" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered the government, the long-standing loyalty is also overthrown in Anlong Vengu.
In April, victims of the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children for the first time.
And in July, jointly with the UN and the Cambodian Court, the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the sentence of the former leader, notoriously violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, unrest grew among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began the uprising, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, following a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993.Great groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their mecenas no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government positions in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak, as unskilled farmers.
“These people had little benefit from the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
“They are surrounded by the utopian agraric ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised without any idea of doing business.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
“Life under the Red Khmer was good,” he said.
“That mouse has eaten them all.”
"But now life is hard, because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge has also aroused concern.
Earlier next year, the court will start investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the executives and those responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the worries in Anlong Vengu.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
A recent steam night, Im Chaem returned from work on the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the dried grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmer.
If the court called her, she would refuse to go.
“In Cambodia there is peace and it is stable,” she said.
“If there are more criminal prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran away from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court searched for more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
“Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it,” he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer relations means grabbing the broken pieces,” he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center released the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important components of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and trials,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complicated and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks, and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge has a great magic.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains is a path grown with weeds and filled with discarded plastic bags that leads to a rectangle of black saws, covered with a rotting plate roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a bunch of tires here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone seller on the edge of the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who was polluted on the spot.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and had planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus Agrees to Appear Its Uran-Based Weapons Stocks
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stocks of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have struck the stone of the wound last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a few covert operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This laid the ground for a Wednesday deal to remove the remainder of the material — about £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as this is a sensitive matter.
The agreement turned out to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was dismissed.
And it was apparently a good move to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to the subsequent summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves that the process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a “very significant, important step” from Belarus.
Obama vowed in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all of their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seventh.
Dozens of countries did so under George W. Bush’s administration.
During the Obama Summit on Nuclear Security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have highly enriched uranium – hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity...We’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We only use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was complicated as the material was slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of which was spent on supplying the Belarusian Research Institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Non-Proliferation Study this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, endeavour to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily due to Lukashenko’s brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement indicates the possibility of gradual melting.
“We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that stricter respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people,” he said.
The Spanish government did not make CIA flights
The Spanish government hasn’t made any drums about CIA flights carrying captured Taliban and al-Qaeda members to Guantanamo via Spanish territory, as the U.S. envoy in Madrid stated in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by WikiLeaks to the El País newspaper, where it is also stated that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vegová requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may show that it has adequate supervision over foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a statement by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister said the announcement of the Council of Europe had "pulled the Zapater government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with intelligence flights across its territory.
“They simply want to be informed” so that they are not “found unprepared,” Aguirre says in one of the documents.
Also then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos suggested to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible contours, but by having this matter in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he had no intention of blocking the judge’s initiative to request the disclosure of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense related to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated components or any sensitive information," the embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concerns about "the apparent coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the disclosure of CNI or the Defense Ministry's information.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of U.S. Ambassador and Interior Secretary Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he instructed his co-workers "to avoid outspoken comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expressed concerns about the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech: People’s Party)’s actions on this issue.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Popular Party will not hesitate to use any indications that the Zapater government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if such disclosures could have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he noted.
Admitted mother-murderer complained on the network about maternal "care"
A young woman was talking about a child when he was already dead and had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself “Muki” on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she used from an early age, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruna, from which the young woman originated.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
Thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship in 1998 with the industrial Ivan Tunez.
They walked together for a year.
Shortly after they separated, she discovered she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn was his, but his ex-girlfriend never allowed him to do DNA tests.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen man was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands in search of a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, from the content of her communication it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone at Menorca and writes: "Alberto is somewhat upset that I left for work."
“When I told him, he felt good, but now he realizes he has to be with the little one all day and can’t do what he wants.”
Then she talks about the sms she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send you the baby."
She complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving the little one with my mother, I’ll marry him when I come back,” she says.
In May, she talks about her return to her home: “I’ll go there this week, but I’ll only stay there until 19, because 20 I have to go for work so I don’t get rid of that place.”
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son to himself.
“He’ll be with whom he’s supposed to be, with me, and never again in my life I’ll leave him with someone other than my mother,” a questionable intention given her bad relationships.
There will be another contribution in July.
By tapping this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of that month and was probably murdered 10 is already dead.
“César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other.”
"On the one hand, he is with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He talks about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (son) to summer school, so I'll save a little money for a babysitter."
17 Greetings and greetings.
“A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when you’re coming.”
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look as he wants, he'll meet me, sex is needed."
On the 30th another message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There’s also one message about Víctor, the current partner: “He gives me money.”
On the Internet there are Moniki's posts on blouses devoted to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself the "Muki ex-prisoner."
“Terror in Galician”.
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial discipline in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center on Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said the accused did not remember how it all happened and "had no intention of hurting the little one in any way."
She previously admitted that she drowned César in the bath and placed his body in a suitcase.
The lawyer and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric examination.
The Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) would lose nine seats and the People's Party of Catalonia would win four seats.
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main word in the town halls of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes received and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People’s Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea of the general elections, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes, compared to 316,222 in the autonomous elections in 2006.
Last Sunday, the Catalan People’s Party (PPC) received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the voters of the PP, continued, the party’s analysts calculated that if general elections were to be held, the PPC could gain 12 MPs in the House versus the existing 8 MPs, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió) would also gain 4 seats (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, possibly gain another one.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next appearance will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist rule in four major provincial cities and also on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest estimated budget – 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the Socialists would not get a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona parliament - as it needs to get at least 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased the number of votes obtained in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turn in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also gained in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
Currently, PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell gives al-Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three others have been detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand that arranged passports to various al-Qaeda groups, including the “Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam” and “Lashkar-e-Taiba”, with the other named group being the author of the bombings in Mumbai in 2008 that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aiming to ensure with the help of "Operation Kampai" the weakening of al-Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus at the international level and "restrict its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then counterfeited and then delivered to groups that make up al-Qaeda’s criminal galaxy so that their “fighters” could travel impunely across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units were also involved in these investigations in addition to the Thai services, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that in the coming days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another operation developed in Thailand, in which Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
It was these men who controlled from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was destroyed in 2009, stealed passports from tourists, which met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents must belong to men between 25 and 45 years of age, have to be valid for several years and have to be visa-free.
The investigative documents emphasize that no facts are known to link the detainees from Catalonia with the Bombay attack, although the perpetrator of the attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was believed to be one of the groups who accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which were "inserted" to purchase cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
Police have seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) calls on Mas to stop the fiscal deal
The Chairperson of the PPC Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity yesterday to present personally to Artur Mas her conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are the same as those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky undertakings such as the economic deal that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his term.
The Chairperson of the Catalan People's Party arrived at a meeting with Artur Mas with the assurance of 18 seats received in the elections of last Sunday, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to abstain from voting on his entry into office.
A future alliance depends on a possible agreement with the PP, which the nationalists in the House would want to maintain when the general elections will be held, but for now, the talks that Mas leads these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As far as PP’s president is concerned, in order to gain her support for taking office, she “will have to end all sovereign and emancipatory speech” as well as an economic agreement – similar to that of the Basque country – which CiU leader even wanted to vote on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to shrink the overwhelming political apparatus of autonomous government and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations regarding Mas’s entry into office will be dealt with within PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquín Nadal (PSC), who has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivero (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of "lack of measures"
Olot Center representatives do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to outline the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vily Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors he cared for.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala, accompanied by the lawyer of the facility, lawyer Joan Canada, announced that "the desire of the La Caritat home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility obliges us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the reputation that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it has not detected the criminal activities of the caregiver in a timely manner, a major threat to the La Caritat home is now the claims for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé has admitted that his first crime happened in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of the home for the elderly with the suspicion that in many cases the deceased were not examined by a doctor in person, but that - given the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled by phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that “the lack of action could in no way be the cause of what happened.”
La Caritat's attorney added that "there are no indications in the case that any third party, other than the accused himself, would have committed the mistake."
The man, now known as the "Angel of Death", admitted 11 killings yesterday, stating that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second elderly woman a month and a half later.
in this case, he caused death by administering too high doses of insulin, unlike in the first case, when he used a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat said that it is complicated to control the access of staff to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were probably in six out of nine cases the means that this caregiver used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila lied and actually sought a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by lining, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe the medical claims and do not rule out that the number of killed may be higher than what he admitted, and justify his behavior in various versions that Vila submitted to the court with the knowledge that he must change his behavior when it turned out that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say they want to be available to the judiciary to enlighten the entire scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to yesterday’s threat from European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The marginal differentials closed by force and the shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to make mistakes – the euro has just risen above the critical level.
What happened yesterday is typical of an unliquid market that, although it is falling, is recovering – but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose their concerns.
The European Central Bank quoted us a month ago to take the liquidity rate back today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to repurchase government debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect it to predict the liquidity rate "at least until March" and adhere to a three-month bidding with unlimited access until the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and even announce its intensification.
If it fails to meet the expectations, it will re-create the reaction of yesterday’s markets, and if it continues to blindly withdraw liquidity, God with us!
The same happened at the Congress in May, where they claimed they didn’t even consider buying bonds, and the markets collapsed – tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armor announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday it said it had already purchased many, causing another market collapse.
Yesterday’s one-year bidding in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell by 30 points, reflecting the change in market mood that occurred after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential 15,000, by February, have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after it failed to detect the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need parliamentary approval of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face of the next EU summit on December 14, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of measures, which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment – to the ears of investors this sounds like the Four Seasons of Vivaldi.
The Trichet and Zapater double effect explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing – we’re probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key tender for a three-year bond, which will be favored by the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will have a high demand for it, which will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don’t need – there are 40,000 million in cash available at El Tesoro, three times more than in March – further high rates and access to markets would close us sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Caesar's Woman - "not only to be, but also to dream about it."
We can.
Eulen Group Chairman attacks Vega Sicilia’s actions requested by his children
The storm of open conflict in the Alvarez family, the owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not cease.
David Álvarez, the group’s founder, will challenge after he perceives it as “completely meaningless,” the El Enebro legal deal scheduled for the 16th of this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize with the help of the bodegas Vega Sicilia procurement administrative authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José join the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the company.
The founder of El Enebro’s largest corporate services holding firm does not seem to be willing to lighten his dispute over membership in the El Enebro group’s governing bodies.
Five of her seven descendants, who appointed themselves leaders at the shareholders’ meeting on 18 January this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register, have been dismissed from its administrative committee.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, resumed the thunder in the womb of the Alvarez family.
Appeal to the judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of the committee until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Martha and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, David Álvarez considers to be “the desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial deception and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the 18 January conduct, which was completely invalid.”
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this behavior as "completely meaningless".
The protagonists themselves, who are quietly silent, have already unsuccessfully attempted to convene a court hearing in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned alongside other Bodegas Vega Sicilia activities, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group, however, according to family protocols, demands the usage right to 51% of the capital.
This is a key question that will have to be decided by the judge when considering the question of judicial appeal.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, nobody took the capabilities of this newly arrived team too seriously, and despite the upward trend from recent times, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso’s triumph of Ferrari.
Without wanting to diminish the riding abilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend has been born in the world of Formula 1 – a “secret weapon” that multinational Siemens deposited in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful march-simulating software that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes far from motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision instruments.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce a product or simulate a process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software device has allowed the Red Bull team to perform “in a few hours, in almost real time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are being modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capability is $40 million, the maximum that any Formula 1 team can spend in each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has established a state-of-the-art plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors, especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great mystery".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s champion of Formula 1 Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in racing circuits, however, other protagonists are hidden, whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was the merit of the riders.
Currently, this ratio has changed and technology is worth achievements from 85%, while pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing as they are “unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to open 20 own stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
It will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 square meters that the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Spanish HP Vice President Helena Herrer gave an example of the newly rebuilt Gran Vía store in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has planned to establish 200 sales locations in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 stores in Spain.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), the store in Barcelona is thus the third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also manages HP HR systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with an exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in securing staff for shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to “improve customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, operating, after-sales service and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pioneering pilot program aimed at addressing potential problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical center in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes, which could otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and regular customers, given that large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service," Helena Herrer stressed yesterday.
Sabadell planned to steal a million customers in three years
More optimistic than other chiefs, Banco Sabadell’s delegate board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it counts on reducing interest rates, but will try to compensate for them by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to acquire a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public aid in the FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients – respectively 700,000 if deducted from those who eventually leave the bank – since until now the institute has rather hustled small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000.
Its market share is 3.5% for private customers, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or one can also say sobriety, in order to reduce costs, whose challenges the bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set goals and disclose them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the situation in the markets required an extension for another period.
Clients who leave savings will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be “a difficult and very important year.”
In fact, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain will be “long.”
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years, which is fundamental for the banking sector's survival, he added.
And while it is believed that the passive war – which reduces margins – is retreating, the price of the risk rate that banks and savings firms pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to the loan prices, thereby offsetting the reduction in margins.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans."
“We haven’t closed the pitch yet, but the differentials are very high,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices – see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now reducing commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "more sizes will be demanded".
“Next year, there will be no stone on the stone,” he said.
It confirms that capital needs are “very reduced” and does not rule out that some Spanish institution will enter among the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB may suplate fundraising on the market before a new capital measure.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary market shutdown, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
He notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of savings mergers
The CECA Director-General denied yesterday that another wave of savings mergers should arise, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of joining the Spanish savings banks began, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in the first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions."
"Most of it is fully completed; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," he noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is taking place “at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as reflected in the payments that at the time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank,” he stressed.
"To move from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has never been compared in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62%, so that they are larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that “there are a number of not very happy opinions about the slowness of the process” that show “a lack of seriousness and understanding” because “what the Spanish National Bank does is reminding us that we must be before the end of the year in the deadline.”
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks and a system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "with the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector went out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but has set conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Management), the operator of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
It should be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is to be, colliding with the idea of adhering to the old traditions that a large part of the other members hold.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while the southern countries would leave the eurozone.
The second is a return to March – although now it may seem like science fiction, this version has widespread support from the public, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is the revision of the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary tightening, fines for the guilty states, possible deferral of payments for some of them, and the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for quotes.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered right (the plans for fiscal tightening and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country as Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has again appeared with a clear position when she called for the reform of the European Union treaties so that it is possible to rescue a member state and at the same time that private creditors are obliged to bear a part of the costs.
This view was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a slightly moderated form, was approved, and in the coming months we should follow the Union’s reform process, which should enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has a red line that it does not want to cross.
And he tells all of us that although measures must now be taken with which he apparently disagrees very much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will end.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries breaking the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce payment delays, and the private sector will also have to bear a part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must follow a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply do not intend to tolerate another option based on receivables and building up, with the enormous gaps in the balance of payments that ruled in the years of Spain’s growth boom.
The offer is clear.
We would make a mistake if we did not understand it.
It is not just about restoring the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want is much harder.
And the worst thing is that in these circumstances, we can make mistakes ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more calm.
Let us take advantage of the opportunity we have in 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his double statement (reforms promised after a meeting with big last Saturday and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the idea of putting things in order has opened up.
But the red line Germany has drawn is here, and it doesn’t seem to want to move with it.
And from the options that can be considered, a departure from the Eurozone filled with not too serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumventing rules
The finties that Alonso and Ramos showed in the match against Ajax show the cleverness and not the intention to escape the penalty.
The allegedly planned exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be written out on whether this is or is not a non-sports behavior, and whether eventually the UEFA should not punish both players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the named players one after the other deliberately wasted time at the time when the faul was to be played out in order to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre – with Real Madrid finishing in their group leading – and will be able, deprived of cards, to proceed to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sentenced coach José Mourinho to two matches and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking yellow cards under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, that is, rules that are not written but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case arose due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which boasts nobleness and honor in its anthem, and which has already punished its players for similar acts), and apparently also due to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocator.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts circumvent the law; in fact, these are actions respecting the rules of sport, whose meaning, however, seems to try to circumvent.
The question is what kind of harm such actions cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the properties of sporting behavior is the physical inviolability of the opponents, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these characteristic features of pure play is to avoid allowing players to have an advantage over the opponent’s team due to their offence – which also did not occur here.
Therefore, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that there was not what we normally characterize as lust or circumvention of the law, there was not a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid a sanction, but this behavior should be as obvious as possible in order to receive a penalty.
They loved and loved the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the culprits of their deliberate transgression will have.
Here it is necessary to conclude that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that in the current match does not get any benefit, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even this is not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by this action, the players will get rid of the penalty, and go to the second round of cards, in which to exclude is enough one card less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit of making strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the cases discussed here, the players did not aim to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or escaping it.
Although the boundary between cleverness and circumvention is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly cleverness.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which instructions were transmitted to provoke them from the leadership.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Fighting offers for organizing Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year’s lava of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid by employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties come again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, they resulted in a struggle to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, agree the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations from the sector.
To complete the complication of numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas day fell on Friday) concentrated applications on a week starting December 13, creating a lava of reservations for days at peak (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As it has been since 2008, when weak years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon the tradition, many employees pay for the parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the border of portability, says Gaieta Farras, president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona.
The representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities at this time does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
“People will think well before making a reservation.”
“They want to go out, but when it comes to pricing, they’re cautious,” he adds.
Shops will go well to those “who offer quality and good service at a favorable price,” he says, reminding that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down a degree and most customers want to spend around 25 euros now.
Surveys in various establishments show that the biggest rush of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom of reservations for this Friday, with the most demands being for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adjusted by the currencies offered, whose total prices range from 25 to 30 euros.
In another prominent company, which is Andilana, counting 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar more early reservations and already from the beginning of November.
“We have done the possible and impossible to keep last year’s prices, and our currency, which everyone should choose from, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
The AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remains optimistic after recording profit growth since the second half of the year and has a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources emphasize that December 18th will also be a busy day, as Christmas celebrations between friends will take place.
They added the Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded a tendency to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine) compared to last year.
They also noticed that companies are already appearing to invite their employees again, and the group size seems to be slightly larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, claiming that the number of reservations has "recovered" even though clients are "dealing to the maximum".
This impression did not disappear during the Christmas celebrations, regardless of who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has sparked unrest in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that the Pakistani nuclear program is provoking in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details they offer regarding the content of the communications and ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in nuclear security, instead of increasing, is “retreating,” and that this unstable Asian country is producing “more nuclear weapons than any other state.”
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that its weapons are not assembled but stored in pieces to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for Washington’s vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of then National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the controlled missile program is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia as spreading and representing a reason to be vigilant.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect its nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear programs or controlled missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The biggest novelty of the documentation released by Julian Assange’s server is the increasingly low cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear weapons proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
A note issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” states: “Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected.”
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also urged Washington, during a visit to the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, “to clarify very well” that “the Pakistani army must end its silent support for terrorist groups.”
WikiLeaks chief
Obama is appointing a senior counter-terrorism officer to prevent new leaks of information.
Interpol is issuing a “red call” to track down and determine where Assange could be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange forms a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday an “emergency call,” a so-called red notice, to “locate and track the movement” of Assange.
However, this is not a typical arrest warrant.
Moreover, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the recent leak of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens’ lawyer assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr Assang.”
It was on 20 November when the International Police Corps based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries have Interpol instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose temporary detention on him and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by the red alert, many member states, as the organization explained, consider the so-called red alert as enabling the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police - especially when countries have a mutual agreement on extradition of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
Assange’s lawyers yesterday published a report stating that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks had shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via a video conference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who is compared to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin’s security.
“This is a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter reads.
While the whole world is looking for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine, in which he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations in violation of international conventions that the United States has signed, she should step down,” he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who called the demands for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views of conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the House of Representatives from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations "so that anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance could be interfered with and prosecuted."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to appeal.
“Obama should write a reward for him or use a drone or something like that.”
Who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, a baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for leaking information has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," he told Fox News.
Puigcercós Seeks Peace in ERC by "Smelling" on Carod's Supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on his stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós appears to have found a recipe for fighting the already several-time internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia), unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as his leader himself, and that he can absolutely not make him such a worry as he had with other lost currents.
Therefore, the Left leader will try to gain new criticisms by means of slandering, which will help him to get into the municipal elections.
Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to speak secretly about his remaining in office.
By voting, not by raising hands.
If Carod’s supporters want to give the president a penalty vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting and subduing his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Caroda’s supporters demand more from the president than to put his position at his disposal – which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight since Puigcercós controls the largest body at the congresses.
But given that they do not have enough majority to enforce resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will vote on the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to move Congress back in the fall of 2011.
The leader of the ERC stated that “multitude” damages stability, and that his goal is for the organization to once and for all be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a symbolic article that the current advisor Josep Huguet has signed on his blog.
Having taken Puigcercós’s ideology into account, this innovation advisor has taken for granted that the leader will be confirmed “in exchange for several goals.”
He named five of them, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means to include new faces who are from the Carod-like sector.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely end the meeting as a mechanism of functioning.
And so he fights for the reform of the statute so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by voting.
Ending the meeting system model, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós’s team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
However, the crumbling assembly of 2008 decided that the assembly should be considered at a special congress on charter reforms.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has deterred from resolving the matter.
Now, without the imminent critical sectors, it might be a good time to deal with this issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murders in November; 390 in 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the daily MILENIO.

Together with him, agents found a ticket with a message.
China achieves its greenhouse gas reduction goal
A representative of the country at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and clarified that it insists on its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference, said.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he said China will not change its targets and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He noted that China’s climate strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue, capacity building, institutional building, and support for pilot programs.
They’ve already made progress in all of these points, including last year’s approval of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to their targets in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, as he said, various multiannual plans are underway or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years, has received investments from the United Nations, governments and private initiatives.
Also running is the provincial climate change project, further the light bulb replacement project for energy-efficient bulbs and the mitigation and adaptation project, has been clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert climate adviser, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he described greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China as 6 tons, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historic share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy utilization – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020.
The Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech: National Action Party) said that the former chairman of this party is entitled to claim his right to the National Order Commission.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legalized, and that the former leader of this party is entitled to appeal to the National Order Commission and claim his right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the Order Commission of the National Council in order that it be a decision made by a competent authority," he added.
He also explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will come out of the next internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (the alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Chairman of the PAN said that behind his side is 71 years of dialogue, and therefore "we are not distracted by internal competitiveness, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said that the committee can choose the best chairman or chairwoman that the PAN deserves for the next three years without debates, so it will hand over the staff to "who the committee will determine".
I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of those five.”
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last July election will be reflected in future clans, though “it’s not yet time to think about 2012.”
"Now we need to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, because "there are many expectations and aspirations in them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet those expectations."
When asked about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) for his speeches in the four years he has ruled, César Nava urged PRI members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI think that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderón, let them start defending them and let them come out of their grasp,” he said.
It was stated that the head of the federal executive power has the right to speak as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, since there is no roubik or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes law to support students without documents on Twitter
“If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize students without documents.
“If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His short report highlights an internet link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on the bill approaches.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block approval of any law unless an extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new anti-proliferation treaty with Russia, called the START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believes that once the fiscal issue is resolved, it will be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
“I think there’s still plenty of time...”
“We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year.”
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to schedule the order of the other matters," he said.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "vote to close the discussion" on the Dream Act, so a proposal to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, though more likely next week.
The Senate’s Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the past five years and were admitted to a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, so they need the help of a few Republicans, so its supporters organizations are carrying out intense agitation to ensure the passing of the bill.
The Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, the Dream Act supporters need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as Florida Senator George Lemieux, who has supplemented Senator Mela Martinez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but said they would not back it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet commented.
Although the House of Representatives is inclined to a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
“Poner el dedo en la llaga,” translated as “to put a finger in a wound,” is similar to the Czech “to hit a nail on the head.”
The second round of the Enjoyment of the Language cycle was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala show.
"I understand Sex in the Language, but... Finger in the Wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to launch the second round of Pleasure in the Language, a cycle celebrating literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another trade fair they were devoted to the topic of Sex in the Language at the round table, she explained).
Finger-to-finger, “it brings us to the narrow,” said the Argentine writer gently to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this round table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Schultz described as a great story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowledge, what is "the wound", goes from the doctor to the doctor, from whom she does not get answers although the trace of the same story yes.
She goes away from the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the way but explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, it’s the psychoanalytic who uncovers that secret: “the wound represents it really opened up and the symbolic is the scar.”
The protagonist breathed lightly and came to the conclusion that "on the morning she managed to learn only so much that it is really open and that it does not exist", but she was convinced that pleasures and traps in language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also performed with a delightful narrative, which he called The Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but in one moment appears.
With elements of magical realism, he tells of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who went far, or repaired the honour lost by a maiden, this narrative that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told him did not miss, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo is quoted here, criticizing the exaggeration in telling the captains of conquest.
“Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), mocked the fake testimony that was presented as true in the stories, but in any other way it never succeeded to tell the story of America with such imagination that it lacked even shame.”
However, he emphasized, "it is the fools and liars who have more imagination" and it is precisely where reality and lie merge, where one no longer knows what belongs to one group and what belongs to the other, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantine tradition.
“Thanks to His message, we have what we have.”
Subsequently, Mayra Monter highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretations made possible by the invitation of the International Book Fair with her phrase Finger in the Wound.
The Cuban-Portorican writer has pointed her finger to the big blow of social violence that is passing through her country – and shared by Latin America – and is a result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry, and good songs make a quiet compromise that is of course not intended," she said after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is being created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction."
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a rush, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which is overwhelmed with dogmatism, one forgets that “there is a small no behind every complaint and a small yes behind every denial.”
“In order to be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must paint: and painting means many times putting a finger in the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and harassing also the authorities who prefer this black and white world,” he said, to promote the meaning of writing.
Romeo is on his first title.
Ruben Omar Romano counted three defeats in the final, during his career experienced good and bad, but he has already managed to at three occasions in the decisive series.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles will also face each other with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in outcomes.
Ruben Omar Romano counted three defeats in the final, during his career experienced good and bad, but he was able to reach already at three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he left with a disordered, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to be satisfied with the silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team in the following final.
As a coach, Santisti arrived in his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament, when he was in the hands of Morelia, with whom he suffered a total 4-2 against Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario tournament, again against the "Devils" from Toluka, Ruben again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenarians" (other nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca) after 210 minutes of play indecisively 2-2, after a series of penalty shootings he got to the advantage three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but eventually his three players missed from 11 steps and the team so suffered a turn to 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says the most important institution is for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important," he said when asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
In his vivid memory, he has previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, “we learned that until the referee tells the end, we can’t celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned, until the match is over, we can’t celebrate.”
He doesn’t worry that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: “You never try to do a series of penalties, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, in the past tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate made us a bad move, maybe because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left us something and hopefully this time something like that won’t happen.”
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the second and taste the fame that titles bring for the first time.
U.S. changes visa rules
People will have to contact the Visa Applicants Service Center before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting times will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the process of negotiating visas for the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services (ASC) before interviewing at the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will collect the applicant’s biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, which include:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a fee for arranging a meeting, the second for processing the application and another for delivering the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 per tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with application (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 per visa for businessmen and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to undergo an interview with a consular official, but will only contact the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Alien Life
The U.S. Space Agency has convened a press conference to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 a.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When inviting journalists, NASA assured that it would present “a discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in hostile conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and which could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found on the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic for life, and this ability increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, other form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual scope of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists exploring Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón produce an opposition "block"
Congressional constitutional law reforms lead to the arrival of “bipartism,” they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term did not even begin when the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia (Shoda) and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of “bipartism” in the House.
Prior to the start of the session at the opening of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from the Convergencia party, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD, and Patrón Montalvo “mocked” against the reform of the Constitutional Act as it dismisses them.
With this reform, they repeated, "bapartism" begins, because now it will be two persons from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit, from the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo said the reforms constitute a political marginalization from the initiative of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and the PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on the political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subdued by these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
“When the opposition coalition came here, I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the willingness to consider the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said they agree with PRD, PT and Patrón and will therefore form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopoly, was now "duopoly".
The aspiration for legislative reform is not to have endless bipartisanism in Congress.
This group begins with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that at the present time Congress has become a "sacrifice" of two - in an allusion to the PAN and PRI parties.
"In the past, it was controlled by only one party, but now it is divided by two."
Patron Montalvo requested that the member’s personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
“In order that the five members of Parliament, who are likely to be nine, but now see us in five, do not remain outside because of the broken agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed, we are outside, and we disagree with this reform.”
A further 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The city council in Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the company that supplies the electrical material.
Another cheque worth a little over 200,000 pesos was sent by the town hall to Loren Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
Thus, the amount paid in the second half of this year to the owner of the company that supplies the electrical material rises to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the town hall’s transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, it was issued for the amount of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was stated “compensation of unpaid payments”.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which has been monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, an additional fee.
What has not been said is the total amount that the city council still owes it, and how many checks will be sent in favor of Camachova Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought now, only what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last on November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as stated by law in the case of firms checked by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the municipality supplier again.
Previously, after July 25, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of the checks issued by the city hall to its contractors, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel Lopez Sánchez, the city of Camachova Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also made transactions with Jumapam, where it collected checks worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Sanchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist into a deep dungeon on Sanchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asking authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Zona Dorada Region, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to pay attention to the impression of the destination, and the bad things tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor state of the streets and paths affects tourists who walk here and see mess, which adversely affects nearby.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to shut down a business for a day, and they don’t have an idea of sales leaking out, otherwise they’t have addressed these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotel manager José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of a tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
“The council will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just repair existing defects,” he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because as residents we also deserve a clean home, the town hall should change its strategy of maintenance of the city.”
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Mazatlán Emblém and El Venadito (a monument, a statue of a deer).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it is not just about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city flooding with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention has not been paid here and these facts emphasize something that is well-known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
Speaking of a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said the rescue of the tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, which however will need to be put in order first to make these places attractive and to be able to put them on the list we have for promoting this destination.”
IP Requests Congress Results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like MEPs to take a great deal of responsibility by taking an example in the search for a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and no agreement between the parties and the State Executive is demanding by the business sector in Mazatlán as Sinaloa is melting in cramps and facing big problems.
The 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, comprises a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they will be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patronage will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the newly elected 40 members of Congress assume great responsibility and be an example on the way to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without any agreement between parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overlappings to move the ruling forward in order.
“We want them to do decent work and be primarily committed to societies and sectors, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of trust in the last election.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an effort to the country’s economic growth, as the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in a way promote job creation.”
As for tourism, he called for the new legislators to give it more weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investments, which in addition directly competes with agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on startup tourism projects, Congress should help deliver the state to security and help with the alcohol law that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings are Seeking
Dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the wish list of children in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their expectations about the upcoming holiday of the Three Kings, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one lamb.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father has no permanent job.
“Sometimes it’s hard because my husband isn’t lucky, but we sell mandarines and potatoes... I go out in the afternoon with the ‘plebees’ on the street to sell,” said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he’d wanted a “monster” car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana would want clothes in size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I told him 'we'll see our son' because it was very expensive," Cayetano recalls with sadness.
For older children who were just in school, would be ideal clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaías has a size of 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size of 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so a pair of five-and-a-half or six would be very suitable for him.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "The Three Kings are Seeking", and bring a gift or cash at the reception of the Noroeste diary.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estonia on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Visits took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that used to manufacture drugs.
"About 750 cannabis beds, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for the production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom are believed to be the bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The detainees had to arrive at the courthouse in Sherbrook after they were arrested.
They could face charges of manufacturing Indian cannabis, holding it for the purpose of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were subsequently conducted after a long investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 police officers of the Estrie City Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec State Police, Sherbrooke State Police and Sherbrooke Police Administration Memphrémagogue.
Illegal migration will continue.
The conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
“I am substantially supported by the Charter.”
"I stand upright on the side of the party that has built a granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly du caucus session.
The Liberals insist that a bill, as proposed, allowing the detention of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it is aimed at a wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we'll see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected critics who want her party to be not strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“Neo-Democrats agree that we should take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be a supporting part of another bill, the C-35 bill,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada on their own and treat it as a kind of patrol.”
They expect Canada to take decisive action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that every member of parliament who is opposed would be held accountable for his position to his voters.
Unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public commission of investigation on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil is striving to keep this idea out of mind: Québec plans to consult with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January next year.
Metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it wasn’t necessary for public security critic, PQ party critic Stéphane Bergeron, to rate the announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of a hat” and “an amateur solution squeezed on your knees.”
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
“They’ll be satisfied with the confirmation: you’ll see the result when we announce it.”
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public hearing of witnesses.
“Moreover, Mr. Charest claims he doesn’t want to create this commission, and people think, like you and me, he’s hiding something,” he explains.
"The only way to the creation of an investigative commission is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to get out of this blind spot, he proposed that Quebec grant a special authority to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as commissioners, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also require Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so that it is better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would be based on the commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Public Security Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his fellow justice officer, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments linked to the file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected biker groups, although the Criminal Code was not yet amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers are under strict surveillance.
Several water streams have been under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, a landslide occurred.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. rains ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were affected most.
It could fall up to 100 millimeters.
If we sum up these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can fear flooding in some water streams.
The Quebec rescue service issued a flood warning on Wednesday night for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in les Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood emergency and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, heavy rainfall caused the drainage of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was destroyed due to heavy rains.
Two buildings had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the spill of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is in emergency and is overseeing the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Centre for Flood Prediction issued a heavy flood warning on Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Council for Broadcasting Standards (RRTV) due to controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians and, as well as for gross expression during broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but some statements contained “incorrect information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians as gross expressions that do not correspond to broadcasts broadcast during the day.”
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the radio broadcasting rules.
The Radio and Television Council received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Joint Front of Beneficiaries of Quebec’s Social Aid.
The group complained that the amounts stated in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the 'Dupont's Afternoon News' have hit a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate way."
No complaint was raised against him.
The latest controversy was about the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort took part in a media shooting that sparked many reactions.
The host of CHOI stated that he did not send any donations to help the Haitians because we cannot be sure that those in need will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unfounded, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriate negative image of the Haitians.
“I’ve already delayed my three-day delay.”
“My file has been untouched for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
Anyway, the CHOI-FM radio broadcasting cooperated “beyond its duties.”
For the station, which will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of Montreal kung fuva.
The inhabitant of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special time.
An athlete who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the tatami and rings around the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal, who may have lived in the capital since 2008, explained to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches somewhat everywhere because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in martial sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a guard and as an assistant for UPS, just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
“I’m currently preparing to go to China for the San Shui World Cup.”
"The competitors who finished first four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
“I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.
I finished eighth in 2005.
"In 2007 in China, I finished in the tournament at five in the morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
Interestingly, I’ve made some progress in every competition.”
“I’m going to be first this year or last year.”
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where fists and legs, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born of this form of fighting, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
No matter how Nacer Zemmal has to keep only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's a bit of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a great experience.”
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, analyzed."
There are four competitors in each category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The semi-finals winners will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category compete so that a single champion, King of Kung Fu, can be crowned."
450 million without public procurement
Hydro-Québec has agreed, by mutual agreement, 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this lavine of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this significant $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Consortium "Energie gérance" obtained a lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint to a consortium of companies before us poses a serious issue of an ethical nature that risks eliminating competition and provoking price increases.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition."
“That means that people, who no longer make side deals secretly, are now doing them openly,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says he can hardly bear how public interest can be sold in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau said in the afternoon that the deal was a collusion.
“I have my own way,” she grumbled, arguing that PQ was “unfair” and “lacked accuracy.”
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice all over the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to group their mutual expertise to respond to a call for bidding for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the extent of the work.
The construction is underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition being able to negotiate; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium’s formula for engineering consultancy is being investigated by the government.
If we fly through the business register of Quebec firms in speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to have been established.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors: CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Regarding the Consortium Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau emphasized in particular the fact that “the Baie James region is characterized by a special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s”.
Eastmain’s chief patron, Réal Laporte, from Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to shake our heads over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a competition and if there are few competitors submitting an offer, your prices may be higher."
“You have two choices: that you pick up the people who appear in that contract as competitors, and that you say, ‘Let’s make a satisfactory deal with a good price.’
“But the main idea is that it’s not the price that matters, but the people’s competence,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Gerance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir calculated 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, especially with laboratories, performing soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, of which Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "Energie gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
Together, they are worth $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ was also linked to the companies that "funded" her, before clarifying that it was more about her managers.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - "green" label does not arouse confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in “impartial” brands and environmental certifications, to follow their product choices accordingly.
The worst thing is that even if we are bathed in the media universe that urges us and encourages us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe complains about the lack of credible information, failure to fulfill obligations, which qualifies even as a brake for its commitment, the Baromètre of responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebec residents who are trying to sell them still don’t believe them very much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t believe the company’s environmental promises, simply because the company’s green advertising finds a measurement tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands labeled as environmentally responsible.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec’s population.
Information on responsible consumption, however, appears to be primary to stimulate this side of consumption, which is currently revived by a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and questionable nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
By the way, one-third of Quebec’s residents bet suspiciously against the stated data about the products or “green” services we’re looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61 percent of them preferred shopping from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of the top 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is happy to present itself as the king of recycling, seeking to have as little impact on the environment as possible by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience obviously remained somewhere outside of their car, the Baromètre reports: in 2010, just 28% of Quebec residents that they were using public transportation or that they recommended using a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, to whom we have asked for a financial contribution to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on the Saint-Laurent Boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of Quebec is proposing a loan, the amount of which would eventually be lower, some original expectation, which could lay the foundation for a viable solution under favourable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The draft and plan of action was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent 10 days ago.
But the government’s counterproposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, the hypothesis of a donation from the state seems to really have to be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centers in Quebec opposed a direct state investment in order to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture should not fund a property-related project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
However, a number of participants in the discussion, on the other hand, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the premises of his cinemas over a decade of film art after himself funding the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the amendment by the state’s financial council.
The shortage of independent film halls is critical in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to release funding to the private sector, believing to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and to screen Xavier Beauvoir’s most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir, so he ignores himself, and he and his group are thinking about proposals for reductions.
Heading to Canada as a whole.
New US diplomatic sources made known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but with the same blow reveal their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter has a Canadian-American relationship at the heart when he goes to vote, and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
Four new reports, among which were the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, laid out to the public’s eye yesterday, provide extra sensitive details to get “under the skin” of each other.
A communication dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of the election campaign, detailed at what point the United States is not part of the betting that political leaders are discussing.
U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“Canada’s inferiority complex, almost embroidered, conditioning potential political leaders to talk about internal betting instead of realizing that these elections also affect the United States (as in the free trade campaign in 1988),” he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands this "blasphemous silence" the less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party, or even better a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be found in the message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s preservation of the confidence vote at the beginning of February on the federal budget to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas parliamentary session in order not to be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties are conditioning their survival by the quality of the proposed reconstruction plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, points to Washington’s increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too insightful references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or abductions for the purposes of violent interrogation by the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, if Europe is ready to accept some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case by case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, he “delivered some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the Secretary of State.”
“The secretary has accepted that the file will be revised.”
Finally, let us note that the persons concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
This was by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
Global Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan to restore home lighting, store lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries to greenhouse gas emissions reduction (GES), which is equivalent to one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of large-scale concrete projects that the UN wants to push forward in Cancún to compensate for the lack of hard-to-realize reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, with fluorocompact bulbs or, even better, electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet generated by lighting would disintegrate.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s equivalent to 70% of the world’s car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should enable the reduction of global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But another 5 Gt will need to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to a stabilization of global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In heated bulbs, 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluorescent compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, we reduce this consumption by twice.
A fluorescent light bulb can last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
New LED bulbs, such as those introduced by Philips this week – this company allegedly participated in a U.N. study – have an estimated life span of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a heated bulb, giving us an idea of potential savings with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostates and emit less heat.
They do not contain mercury.
Several experts have expressed concerns about fluorescent compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection plants.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluorocompact bulbs, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation a year.
The report also outlines in detail the profits each country would make from this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is looking forward to the election results.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential elections after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results," the UN president's spokesman said.
“It calls on all sides and institutions in Côte d’Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission let the latest date — midnight on Wednesday — pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s screw.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission was “continuing its work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls worldwide multiplied to CEI finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the retreating Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment by the Constitutional Council for the “fraudulent” voting in the north, managed by former New Army rebels (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Director of the Ivory Coast Presidential Campaign, confirmed that voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country dissuaded Ivory Coast supporters from going to vote.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
But opponents of President Gbagbo believe the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any association with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as “unacceptable” and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was considered the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassano Ouattara, who won public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the word according to the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as indicated by the provisional seasonal deviation correction (CVS) data published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area reached 2,631 million.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are out of work in the third quarter but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of current young people on the labour market has further escalated with a new rise in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
As for seniors, they recorded a mild increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is, 482,000 people from 50 years old and above and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 a benefit from the unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and jailed
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste processing companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement allegedly fraudulently acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abusing the company’s assets, abusing public funds and public assets, hiding, providing bribery, receiving bribery to influence the office and holding ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a warrior and insists that they explain to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, and not any delusions."
"It's easy to pursue him for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before hearing her client.
Mr Guérini stated, through his lawyers, that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds associated with their operation, he never knew of anything like that, Mr. Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former general director of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was accused on Wednesday of abuse of public funds and conspiracy, and released, under judicial supervision with a ban on contact, the protagonist of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give explanations to all the facts that were blamed on him."
"The investigating judge will take this into consideration and leave him free," his lawyer, Yann Arnoux, said.
Four other people have been charged and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial surveillance, the deputy government chief Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director with the elegance of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for receiving bribery to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "theft and misuse of the company's assets", the other for "complot in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini’s business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of “hiding the misuse of the company’s assets.”
Among the persons confronted by Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped launder money from large-scale gangsterism.
The investigation is carried out as part of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 and subsequently after receipt of anonymous letters relating to alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case of Clotilde Reiss: Elysee Palace Exaggerated Syrian Mediation
For more than a decade, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "spying," unified views in France, put the diplomacy in combat alert and stressed the relations between Paris and Tehran.
This was closely monitored by U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not a compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for clandestine trade in material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they shed a sharp light on the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing for it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 was entitled: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with the hostage case."
The Elysee Palace Advisor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with U.S. Foreign Office Representative Allegrone.
The French method is explained.
They advise Americans to do just as much to be transported back to their homeland by their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously pronounce strongly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, into trouble.
“Do it the more they ask you to stop.”
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of avoidance manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is “Iran’s family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of “political blackmail.”
It announces that the release of Klotilde Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day the French embassy provides her with shelter) “will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians” (a caution of 230,000 euros).
And it will announce that the Elysee Palace is anticipating cases of hostages, a phenomenon that “will escalate.”
The Iranians could "in the future arrest another about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss has been released from jail for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illicit trade in Iranian-sensitive electronic material, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France signed an agreement?
Liberation of an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he says, was not only “shocked by this judge’s decision,” but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There have been talks between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under “limited” surveillance by the French intelligence service.
The Elysee Palace adviser calls a telephone number, hangs a headphone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings administered by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of Clotilde Reiss’s imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through a communiqué and organized “leaks” into the media to convince that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a “significant” and “influential” role as a “mediator.”
Americans observe this activity not without irony and say that the manipulation bears fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of August 25, 2009 evokes the media’s “blessing” of French officials.
What is the basis for such a degree of “gratefulness” expressed to Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praiseful statements, French officials in private admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then addresses the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to apply in this fiction.
The intense communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy of opening up with Syria," he analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labeled premature and unmerited."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “seed the grain of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
“But we thanked them.”
"This should at least cause confusion and confusion among Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy in the Elysee Palace.
In the statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecival", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior official at the ministry responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to people who request to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intense use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in the world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA determines the host countries.
Full of unrest due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday establishes the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, a sovereignly politically motivated selection where struggle for influence and lobbying risk outperforming technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the FIFA Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to succeed in conquering new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010 or continue to deploy to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that will participate within the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets of the whole world.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to set a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the voting hour.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the disclosure, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adam) may have so destroyed the chances of its country, the cradle of the crush, which has so far hosted the world championship only once, a year.
The BBC launched a documentary on Monday showing three influential members of the European Commission, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA dissatisfied and bring English leaders into trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes he will be able to repeat the move of his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win for London the organisation of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new glow to its name at CE (European Commission)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spanish-Portuguese pair does not lack the trumphs of the already prepared stadiums, his benefits (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Eventual retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which has been an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal allusions barely twisted to the accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud on them, we will try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with its considerable experience from 1994.
The highest-performing economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, this country seems to have a great advantage over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have drawn up a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem premature for both countries, which jointly underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which is eagerly sought by FIFA, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out a big ass in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than assurances.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could be bragging for the chaotic TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand seemed to be hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jacques Chirac were not at fault.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The Elysee Palace mandate calls someone else.
The current president will be elected in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good shape with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if doubts persisted constantly.
In one and the other sense.
In 2006, not wanting to believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he will make a decision sometime in the fall of 2011".
As recalled before UMP members of parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" sowed a little hot state.
Was it an official announcement of his nomination?
He was not far from that.
The President only reminded that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he reminds in such meetings with a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years left with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: “Don’t think I’m not considering the next stage.”
His yesterday’s statements will not make him a candidate more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate less.
If they cause comments, it’s because of double truth.
Accelerating the path to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it’s not the entrance to Ségolène Royale’s cradle that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to condemn himself.
It is, on the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want the arrangement into combat sets rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon over the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," people from the nearest neighborhood of the prime minister reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB this year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the outcome of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The sovereign European debt crisis is bound, and the securities institute will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of deteriorating the situation now already so tense on the European securities markets.
The political price would be even higher.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favor of resolving the debt crisis of European countries.
She did not want to say if she thinks the bank could do more, for example by boosting its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)".
On the evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committees of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent about his intentions and satisfied with stating that the program of buying government bonds in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that will take place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep its base fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically low level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds by the European Central Bank has doubled in the past week to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And due to the unreasonable negotiators in the market, yesterday it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, Eurosystem central banks have purchased for €67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market dealers about the anticipation of continued purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant change.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the European Central Bank’s arsenal, the latter shall provide unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
“I can’t imagine she would change her program in a significant way.”
“If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases in order to revive the faint market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposures of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, they have no choice but to maintain their presence in the market.
"It needs to compensate for the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and to act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by the states, which are among the most fragile," a prominent bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, countries will be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It is the saving of the euro at this price.
Berlusconi's government in Italy
After the beginning of the week for Italy concerned the situation somewhat relaxed, yesterday with a backflow of bond interest on 10 years.
Return to Temporary Peace.
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister, the heads of the regions said they heard Giulia Tremonti qualify the situation as “irresolvable” and that he expected a “unpredictable” weekend, which the participants then denounced.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy coverage contracts (CDS) surged to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hander, Gianni Letta, said he was “too busy” with “turbulent market developments” and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencryptedly, its problem is the lack of growth and vague fiscal inputs, which go hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the deficit of public finances will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new set of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will need to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
“The foundations of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we’ve repeated it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s Board of Directors under Italian pressure on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There is political instability.
Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence to the House of Representatives on December 14 and then elections, scheduled for the end of March, could begin.
This would give rise to a period which would be inadequate for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans have demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion of interest rates on European government bonds has brought water to the mill for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can’t talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a lack of transparency and obvious policy, relying mainly on the banking systems, which is real," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas said.
“Political time runs more slowly than market time.”
Conscious of this interrupted context and the dangers it presents, European countries are intensifying the discussion aimed at strengthening the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the issue and, on a wider scale, with their G20 counterparts are developing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank’s meeting is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support Eurozone countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, embarked on a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of this journey is not to raise funds, it surely prepares the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issuance of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funding by further direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that are accompanied by strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have taken a different path than Greece and Ireland have taken.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before they apply their own budget corrections and decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting trust.
Finally, capital participants in European funds are talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
During his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to regain its stockpile of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the player of the very first European sovereign debt trading plan, judge that an additional €100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The instrument exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is currently subsidized by €60 billion.
It has all the possibilities to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorate.
Snow and snowfall: 24 counties have an orange alert.
Snow distribution is still causing difficulties in transportation, especially on second-class roads in Bretagne, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts have an orange alert because of the risk of snow and storms.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne have joined the 20 districts that have already declared an orange emergency, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfall causes problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and weak snowfall in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowfall is large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tons on the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to the police, and the police recommend to go out with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
School connections were banned on Thursday.
There are no restrictions on freight traffic on Wednesday night.
The district authority “calls on all drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt their driving to the nature of the road.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights to Paris’s Roissy Airport and 10% to Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Proposals
Since the discussion of modernising transportation in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have rained.
At least during the discussion.
We recall 23 billion in particular for the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
The state has announced a subsidy of 4 billion euros for the construction.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first points.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is being reviewed by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set forth to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and the increase of the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, reads “in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris”.
It is quantified: "The income from this interest is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists "to be modernized, to increase the return obtained from it, and to affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it bring?
by Prelude.
This is not quantified in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital subsidy that will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
For us in the SGP, this system does not seem to be shocking.
“From the moment we’ve created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then grab up to 4 billion, he explains here.”
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will be allocated only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belongs to absent subscribers, risks provoking somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be on December 7.
Hackers and Intelligent Intelligence
The case of Wikileaks has a double significance.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that appears to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future controlled by regression.
Let us proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, that is, the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's way of sexual life are what everyone could have read in any newspaper for months (all except Berlusconi's own), and Gaddafi's cartoon profile has long been the subject of sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents may only consist of reports already known is crucial in the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in the previous works.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (not even knowing where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who practice occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
This is the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) head of the intelligence services (and if not, he might, as I know, be the editor of the Libération newspaper) who considers only what he himself confesses to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department, was the same that Newsweek published a week earlier.
So why was there so much whisper about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely, that embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly away for a dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into spy centers.
Anyone watching films about the investigation knows very well that it is only by hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly dishonors the duty of hypocrisy and throws that bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information of the world’s most powerful country represents a tough, not negligible, blow to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors".
But let’s move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, it was possible to hold all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orwell’s prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction carried out, every hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, has made the citizen a complete victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it is now, that even the "tombs" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of any hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker – elected as a citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can one maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an obscurant secret (and the obscurant secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious obscurant secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were obscurant secrets, is to deprive him of all power.
WikiLeaks did not make a mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something great with Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of such a great power?
Obviously, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online – this would be equivalent to publishing it on a poster carved on a street corner.
But it’s also quite obvious that with current technologies it’s futile to hope that it can be kept confidential messages on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state travelled by plane and connected with any of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept confidential in the future?
I know well that for now my forecast is science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are transported discreetly fulfilling formalities on uncontrollable routes and carrying with them only those messages that they know in memory or rather hide rare information in the heels of their shoes.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-closed drawers: overall, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving side-by-side, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the wireless telegraph (telephone).
Video cassettes (analog) have allowed movie lovers to shoot the movie step by step, shift it forward and back and uncover all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (numerical) only allow you to jump through chapters, that is, through macro portions.
Through high-speed trains we get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while to travel by plane and transportation, which involves we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual that politics and communication techniques return to horseback cars.
The Last Note.
Another time, the press tried to understand what was hidden in the secrets of the embassy.
Now it’s the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Hacked Its Financing Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the promise of rapidly unblocked financing (so-called fast-start or early-start financing) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (that is, €420 million per year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU drew a big ass to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start financing: a report outlining the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and rewarded for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it mobilized €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to fulfill its promise of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are “new and additional” under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to Public Development Aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus in what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as the year of reference: international funding has beenined and it is adding 150 million for three years to the fast-start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment dates or with dates at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Development Aid.
Specifically, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) in order to meet its commitment to fund “new and additional...
Another crucial element is the division into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 euro borrowed is equal to 1 euro donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments that are profitable (often emission reduction projects, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro we receive as the equivalent of one euro we give... we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rate).
But France can only submit such a reasoning: it “complies” with its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91,5% is made by loan (389.8 million euros) and 8,5% by donations (36.1 million euros) – see the EU document to verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the world that uses this type of loan.
Germany has demanded 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the overwhelming majority of the European Union will give 1 euro to fulfill their promise, France will give only 10 centimeters and consider this effort comparable.
A beautiful piece!
To summarize, in its “fast start” financing, France operates with a double scam: on the one hand, with the development of the stock in time and on the other, with a real financial burden.
Despite spending only €36.1 million, he is able to convince that he is spending €420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would member states continue to donate when it is enough to only borrow?) and in negotiations because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this is not our case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to draw insights from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of decency and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions about deposits in long-term financing (another key chapter currently being discussed): we do not escape the question of "additionality" or how to account for loans.
France should change its stance to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
Therefore, everyone puts hope in the new environment minister, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will visit Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France’s fast-start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans could raise the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
A warning about pesticides that children will consume.
A ten-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Rights and Preservation Movement for Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results “do not have a significant statistical value given the low number of analysed samples, but are characteristic of the problem being processed,” bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a snack for one child about a decade old in supermarkets in l’Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations – five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day – as well as candy, have been analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are ranked as carcinogens, possible or likely, and five are among the clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as interfering for glands with internal discharge (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Al in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, potentially carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain about ten residues with potential carcinogenic effects and three proven certain carcinogens, as is the case for about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, which was by studies as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, in which studies have discovered traces of potent insecticides banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the steak from the milled meat, the tuna in the can, and even the goose and chewing gum were rubbed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
A steak of salmon for dinner was "the richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave did not avoid the analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this “cocktail of contaminants” is probably underestimated,” the study finds.
Green Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides "in the face of an emergency" to stop the "rise of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the residual status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
