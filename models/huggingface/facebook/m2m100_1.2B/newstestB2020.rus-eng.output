China opposes U.S. adoption of "Taipei Bill"
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communique.
This was stated on Friday by the official spokesman of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China in the affairs of Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.

China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and by no force, Ma Xiaoguang stressed.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group Falun Gong, the Guardian reports.
The documents revealed that the owner of TikTok (the ByteDance company) is using the app to promote China’s foreign policy goals abroad.
The majority of violations of China’s policies fall under “hatred incitement.”
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant posts in a context suitable for the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.
For example, the prohibition on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on mentioning the incidents at Tiananmen Square or the Cambodian genocide falls under “a distortion of the history of China or other countries.”
The document also lists the banned names of twenty “foreign leaders or state figures,” including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sen and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Ki-Hi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Posts from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and can result in the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: “Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and also engage independent local professionals.”
Russian users TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" is agreed with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without consent, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov responded affirmatively and said he had seen such publications.
With Bogdanov agrees the founder of the agency Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
But under these rules you can subtract any content that does not like moderators, Zarypov notes.
Zaripova is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
According to the User Agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over the age of 13.
Social network administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account may be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the WeWork co-working site.

Russians warned of fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters that replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is by "Kommersant" with reference to data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transferred to telecommunications operators information about more than 2,5 thousand numbers from which customers of various financial institutions were called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement of the number.
Another 218 rooms were blocked, and in 59 cases the use of financial services was restricted.
Deputy head of the Department of Information Security of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks have faced the change of the number.
He explained that the operators do not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the law "On communication".
In the bank "Opening", Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed information on the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the change of the number.
As in the press service "Bilayna", part of the information about fraudulent calls, which was transmitted by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to malfunctions in the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudulent numbers, to which the telecommunications operator will contact each call to verify the number.
He explained that to create such a base will need to amend the legislation.

Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky Ukraine's accession to NATO
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s membership in the alliance during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was stated during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Responding to the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also stressed that in his answer he did not name the dates of Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards.
In Crimea offered Zelensky an alternative course to NATO
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, instead of the course for NATO membership, should engage in the establishment of good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by the Chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
“Mr. President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but it is worth listening to the advice [of President of the United States] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and to improve relations with the President of Russia,” Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to remain in power if relations with Russia are established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the topic of the country's accession to the alliance.

Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar.
Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the attacker to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise they refuse to return.
Neymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: under the agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he should have received 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, the lawyer of the Brazilian insists that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar’s claims, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blue-Granate insisted that the bonus relied on the fulfillment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player owed only a quarter of the 40 million euros and demand the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the "miserable" player to the belly of Catalonia.
True, the deal collapsed, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
And here, as Sports.Ru reports with reference to insiders, the lawyers of the club said to the representatives of the player that if the question of financial claims will not be settled in the pre-trial procedure, it will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar wanted to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

How to increase the future pension and not recycle
The pension is paid not only by the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also by non-state pension funds.
NPPs are private companies, reports Volgogradskaya Pravda.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them and eventually returns you money with interest.
If you are interested in this method, then first study the information about the NFP on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate according to uniform rules, which are established by federal laws.
Pension points can be purchased by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of experience you lack to accrue your pension.
This method is suitable for those who have worked informally.
In addition, you can make a contribution for your relative, for example, for a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about retirement at the beginning of their work path.
Increased pensions are paid to public service employees, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Far North.
In order not to refuse anything to yourself with the onset of retirement age, take care of it in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, put money on deposits.

54-year-old Curtis Miller (Curtis Miller) was digging in a bunch of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by the evening walk Todd Beavers.
The latter decided to join the search and found among the garbage a black cart.
Miller saw the Beaver discovery and was upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he was the first to dig into the garbage.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beaver grabbed the cart and ran with it toward his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to chase the opponent.
He pursued Bevers near his house.
Miller grabbed the sword out of the knives and started waving it in the direction of the kidnapper of the cart.
Beaver told Miller that the incident was recorded on the video.
Seeing the camera, Miller fled, but threatened to return.
Beaver left his car in the yard and entered the house.

Troubles in Three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protest actions the further, the more noticeably it breaks down into separate fragments and loses political fulfillment.
The evidence of the very fact of the “mass riots” cannot be verified, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire the society, but it will surely leave in extreme irritation the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence proved futile.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minaylo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and after a few hours and completely rehabilitated: the SCR removed the charges from him.
Minaylo was arrested for almost two months, and several professional communities joined him: historians, priests, and writers.
After that in the case remained only two accused of participation in the mass riots (initially accused was 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samaritdin Rajabov, who on the eve of the court extended the arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the joke petition about the accession of Latvia to the United States
The court of the Vidzem suburb of Riga sentenced the author of the joke petition about the accession of Latvia to the United States of America Denis Bartetsky.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of corrective work and one year of probation.
“Healthy sense is not the strongest side of our system,” Bartetsky said in a statement.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on the accession of Latvia to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, signatures were collected on the site about Latvia’s accession to the “Galactic Empire” and about the country’s exit from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
A criminal case was initiated against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country – “Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
In 2016, the author of an online petition on Latvia’s accession to Russia was sentenced to six months in prison.

The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and an independent anti-corruption examination.
According to the explanatory note, amendments to the law "On police" should enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed the law on punishing for "evident disrespect to the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles, and for the repeated violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Shortly after that, the Chudovsky district court of Novgorod region fined a local resident with 30 thousand rubles for placing on the network "two records with information in an inappropriate form, which offends human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect to society, the state, the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation".

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous - pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all legumes (most popular - soybeans), hemp, flaxseeds.
However, many experts believe that such supplements cannot act as a full substitute for natural hormones.
The potential harm of such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues come into the body from the outside.
Veretennikov called for the revival of Kazakhstan’s “Genius”.
The former attacker of "Rotor" and the Russian national team Oleg Veretennikov joined the action to revive the Kazakh "Genius".

I couldn’t stay aside!
I spent a year and a half at this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its dedicated fans who have always been with the team!
I will always remember the Munitpasov stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career.
Genie must be reborn!
He has a great history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the authorities of the city will return their native club!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

The hydrometeorological center named the true popular signs
In Russia, there are many popular techniques by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The hydrometeorological center checked all the signs that allegedly worked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, though, in a short period of time.
As said by the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be good, as our ancestors observed.
And if the sky lights white, then the next day will rain.
The second working sign is based on bird observation.
Most often they say that if they fly low, it is usually to rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, the mosquitoes wet their wings and birds are forced to descend to hunt insects, TASS writes.
On different continents there are their own folk marks.
Surka Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day you need to observe the swallow coming out of its hole to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spots found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The pollution was scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first detected oil spots began to arrive on September 2.
However, every day up to Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turns out that all of them are identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state-owned oil company Petrobras, which received the samples for analysis, said that their composition did not correspond to the oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
“It is thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do it.
And most likely it got into the oceanic stream,” said Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the trade union of workers of the oil industry of the states of Pernambuk and Paraíba, Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to dump waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with the company Petrobras, will start cleaning the polluted beaches.
For now, experts of the institute recommend tourists and locals to bypass the oil spots side by side and alert about all detected pollution foci.

Russians have nothing to put off for retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvijenko believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to make the bill on a guaranteed pension product fully effective in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another issue is how timely it is.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase the pension support in the future," Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and calculation of pensions, because "constant changes in this sphere have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to improve the size of pensions and the social security of citizens.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities", - said V. Matvienko "RIA Novosti".
She stressed that if this initiative (the bill on guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles must be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that the draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP) was sent for approval.
Among its main elements are exclusively the voluntary procedure for joining citizens to the savings system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of citizens' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for and tax deductions for citizens.

This was from a Sony press release, which says that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on the screens on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the sharing of revenue, which will cause Spider-Man to leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the film are owned by Sony.
She rented them for Marvel films, which belonged to Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from film cash, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said he was delighted.
It’s amazing that Spider-Man’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“We are all at Marvel Studios very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a sign figure.
He is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world,” he said in a statement.
At the same time, Figi reminded that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built around Spider-Man.
So it happened that he was the only superhero in different film universes.
So while Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account a passage from the film The Wolf of Wall Street, in which the hero Leonardo DiCaprio screams "I don't leave!"
Information about disputes between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash revenue from Spider-Man movies on the condition that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the paintings.
But that didn’t please Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: "We have been working together greatly for the last four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was proportionate to the wishes of many fans [Spider-Man].
We are happy that we can move forward together.”
Avengers: The Final, which united Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the best-selling film in the history of world cinema, displacing Avatar from the first place.

The expert explained why it is worth to give up tea in bags
A group of Canadian scientists, representing the University of McGill, found that when a tea bag is baked in a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion particles of microplastics are dropped.
The packaged beverage can also add particles of asphalt, said Nation News food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonova.
According to the agronom, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
They are not thrown at the end of the season, so they may be in the tea.
"Moreover, the bags do not always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to refuse to use such a drink in favor of tea for weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles heat up to high temperatures, due to which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - such a drink will have the least additives," the expert said.

Regions invited to share secrets of business support
On September 27, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy of the Federation Council Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express their position on the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time for interregional relationships
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the business development programs and the legalization of self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the challenges of SME development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
"Today, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the entrepreneurial community in all the regions visited by senators has indicated the issue of the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," said Andrei Kutepov.
In the appendix to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (it is at the disposal of the editorial board).
In addition to the profile ministries, aggregated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” the senator told Parliamentary newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, programs of support of small and medium-sized have been adopted and successfully operated.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Centre for Entrepreneurship Support, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovsk region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar region, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are granted grants at the expense of the regional budget.
In the Orlovsk region there is a centre of cluster development.
Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers, at the expense of the federal budget.
In other regions, special measures are being taken to support youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to get out of the shadow
According to the regional authorities, to more effectively support small and medium-sized, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employed" with "entrepreneurial activity", as this "most corresponds to the content of the state service to promote self-employed unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovsk region, it is considered necessary to make amendments, providing for the expansion of the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities on decoration and repair of residential premises, country buildings, physical training.
The Bryan region considers it important to strengthen control of unfair dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostrom and Magadan regions they advocate for the consolidation in the legal field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of support of social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs for support of small and medium-sized, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills,” said Andrei Kutepov.

Sanctions shipments to Russia dropped 100 times
The Russian government estimated that the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries covered by the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioning countries against 3 million 442,2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, reports "Interfax".
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion to $975.5 million respectively.
These are goods that are not covered by the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the falling volumes of prohibited imports were compensated by increased imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until 31 December 2020 the period of validity of the rules of destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited for import to Russia within the framework of counter-sanctions.
In the document, posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the term of validity of the rules has been extended by one more year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the resolution on the abolition of the sanctions extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine joined the list on January 1, 2016.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported "sanctions" (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is by TASS, citing the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week the construction of the dome of the building officially began, where the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will be located, the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project yet.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters in size.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help the E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as the search for Earth's binaries.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, the mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory have been being developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value amounted to about 400 million euros, received the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
