I wonder which country will censor Tatoeba first.
I made some changes.
Tom couldn't decide right away.
They're like day and night.
I never saw you guys.
It looks like Mary's drunk again.
A man who doesn't spend time with his family can't be a real man.
I'll get to the point.
Would you like to dance with me?
I have to start walking home.
I've probably done that a hundred times, I think.

No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's it worth?
I'd be happy to.
I'm sorry, but that's true.
We're going to put on the Christmas tree.
What were you looking at?
The victim was lying face down in the carpet.
You're choking me to death.
They married, even though they barely spoke each other's languages.
The bathroom is behind the stairs.
I want an ice cream.
- Good for you.
You're the one I love the most.
The number you have chosen is not available.
Tom bounced back.
- Welcome to the house.
It wasn't great.
Easy to catch, easy to pass.
Have you all found your mistakes?
Where does your uncle live?
The house was quiet.
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.
Tom took Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anakonda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The sea was frozen, so we crossed the ice.
Why doesn't Tom ever visit us again?
That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
You don't care about that?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
It hurts my knee when I bend it.
None of this is real.
I lost everything I had.
We have to go now.
Tom nodded down.
It's all right, man.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom is scared.
I got a Christmas present.
She plays hockey on weekends.
You don't talk much.
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Tom took off his clothes and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Nasse.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's been putting on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It's uncertain whether the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything wrong.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really gonna do this?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She was crying.
Can I see Tom today?
No one wants to.
Who destroyed this?
How do you think I feel?
A Japanese garden usually has a pond.
I'm not feeling well at all.
Tom likes to eat cold pizza for breakfast.
Tom is down.
You should have seen her.
I need to buy the stamps.
Tennis is his hobby.
Tom did a good putt.
Do you prefer a male or female doctor?
The door's locked.
Try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I walk like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're taller than me.
- Happy birthday to you.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
I was bored with her speech.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do what Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better suggestion.
The ice is very thick.
You understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, including the boy.
Kate has a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan, exactly?
Tom seems bored.
He's not mad.
There's no doubt who's going to be elected.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read The Lord of the Rings trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She was a proponent of equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
- Hey, you, bro.
Where is the Portuguese embassy?
My friends didn't betray me during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just being a little bit of a jerk.
- Stay down. - What?
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Get dressed quickly.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The sex of the test cabins rang through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the corner.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works at the city's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man across the road.
No one's too old to learn.
I would do anything for love.
Two men in ski masks broke into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom cheated on me.
Tom is helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the sock.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time is up, so submit your assignments.
My father is fine.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have money, you can live without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're mad.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even my mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm out of work.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom in a few minutes.
He's going to fall for the temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
What's it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this stuff.
Everybody needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What was that supposed to mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
You ready now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during work hours, I'm paying for my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Magdalena and Ania are both Polish.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked with the headlights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom is worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
It's got to work.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My engine saw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
A squid has ten arms.
She didn't show up until two.
I'm going to be.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I've never seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom is quick.
Of the Finns, about 4.9 percent are Swedish, that is, people who speak Swedish as their mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom married.
What's the difference between American and British English?
I'm going to read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.

I have to get home.
I forgot my bag.
I'm writing a letter to my wife.
Does Tom like me?
- Help me, please!
I'm not going to school.
You can't come with us.
You seem to have confused me with my big brother.
He showed up earlier than usual.
I don't like working on weekends.
We're going to protect you.
We built a sand castle.

He's single.
What time did you go to bed last night?
Let him wait a beat.

He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't.
Tom could have corrected himself.
Give me an example.
I'm in a bad mood.
Tom can't get up.
Maybe you don't watch that much TV?
It'll have to wait.
He said he didn't know.

Tom discussed the problem with Mary.
You're staying home?
Give me another nail.
You can be sure of that.
You have to move now.

You're weird. You know what?
A car was driving through a pool of water and it splashed me all over.

We're playing game!
I don't agree with you on that one.
Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend?
What's the word?
I never wear costumes.
Does Tom drink coffee?
They're high school students.
One of you is lying.
I've got plenty of time, so can I sleep for a while?
He always cries when he's drunk.

How was the show?
It's actually pretty common.
It's made of leather.
Tom said you were happy.
