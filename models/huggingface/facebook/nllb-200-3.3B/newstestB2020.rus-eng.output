We have meetings to prepare for and to correct the situation.
How did you do that?
If we knew, we'd have fixed it by now.
But first, I think we need to add a component like martial arts.
I think we have a problem with that.
Kremlin supports ban on smoking on the balconies of residential buildings
The Kremlin supports any measures that will save lives, said presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the ban on smoking on balconies and apartment lounges.

There is an administrative penalty for violation.
The Kremlin is positive about any decision that helps save lives.
"We know how many fires are occurring, many of them with very tragic consequences and public resonance.
Therefore, any saved life justifies such decisions", Peskov said.
First of all, the press secretary sees this as a firefighting measure, not a way to protect the neighbors from the tobacco smoke.

China strongly opposes the US adoption of the "Taipei Bill"
China strongly opposes the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiques.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the PRC on Taiwan Affairs, Ma Xiaoguan.
The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguan said.
He said that Taiwan is part of China and that the issues related to Taiwan are China's internal affairs.
"We call on the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait", he noted.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok hides videos that are unwanted from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
This is the China / Reuters
Chinese social networking site TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
The documents revealed that TikTok's owner, ByteDance, is using the app to promote China's foreign policy overseas.
The bulk of the violations related to Chinese policy fall under "hate speech".
In each case, TikTok puts the objectionable posts in context, fitting under the general guidelines, so that the social network's actions do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban on "criticism or attack of the politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc".
Banning references to Tiananmen Square or the Cambodian genocide falls under "distorting the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the forbidden names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document said.
The forbidden material falls into two categories, the document says.
The first category of posts is deleted by the social media administrators and may lead to the user's blocking.
Less serious violations fall into the second category: these posts remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok's algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules are outdated and no longer applicable: "We now use a localized approach to moderation, as well as involving independent local experts".
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on what they can post, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producer Center.
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers are coordinated with the representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without coordination, Bogdanov reports.
Asked if it is possible to comment on politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov said yes and said he had seen similar posts.
Roman Zaripov, the founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminatory statements, etc".
But these rules can include any content that moderators don't like, Zaripov said.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, its global user base is over 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
According to the terms of use, only people over 13 can use TikTok.
The social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the network decides that the user is underage, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork coworking.
Residents of Istanbul told about the earthquake in the city
A strong earthquake has caused panic in Turkey's largest city.
Last Thursday, September 26, an earthquake of magnitude 5.9 occurred in Istanbul.
Thirty-four people were injured, ten of them are still in the hospital.
Melike, a resident of Istanbul, admitted that she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.

I cried right in the workplace.
Later, I got better, I went back to work.
But I am so ashamed now!", the girl told the "360" TV channel.
"There was a really big earthquake in Istanbul
I can't go back yet!
But overall I'm fine", said political analyst Jaylan Ozgyul.

Roshealthnadzor reported on the results of the check on the fact of amputation of the child
A child in the Rostov region had his arm amputated due to a mistake by doctors, reports "Vzglud" with reference to the website of the territorial body of Roszdravnadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, after which he was put on a cast in the hospital of the Zernograd district.
After a while, the child developed gangrene, and an amputation was performed.
The investigation revealed that there were violations of the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and scope of the assistance provided.
The inspection materials were sent to the regional office of the SC of Russia.
Earlier, URA.RU reported that the head physician of the South Ural hospital was arrested.
Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, calls from fraudsters who substitute bank phone numbers have increased.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to data from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave telecom operators information on more than 2,500 numbers that were used to call customers of various financial institutions.
In 189 cases, operators have detected a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases, restrictions were imposed on the use of financial services.
Deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had faced the change of number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the law "On Communication".
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank have confirmed reports of an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a change of number.
As reported in the press service of "BiLine", some of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank had transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would cause the organization to fail.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' numbers, which the telecom operator will contact at each call to verify the number.
He explained that creating such a database would require amendments to the legislation.

In September, Roskomnadzor found political advertising on Google, Facebook and Youtube.
According to the agency, this occurred during the Russian elections on September 8.
The facts of the violations were passed to the State Duma commission.
Google later said that the company supports responsible political advertising.

Facebook said that the responsibility for compliance with Russian election laws should be borne by advertisers, not the platform.
Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov accused the company of applying double standards when placing political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky the accession of Ukraine to NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary-General said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked if the issue had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said they had indeed discussed the issue, and emphasized that he had not specified a date for Ukraine's accession to NATO in his response.
According to him, any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT writes.
In Crimea, Zelensky was offered an alternative to NATO
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should focus on building good neighborly relations with Russia instead of pursuing NATO membership.
This was reported by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets on Friday, September 27.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but he should heed the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia", said Chegrinec to RIA Novosti journalists.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will remain in power only in case of establishing relations with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had held a conversation with Zelensky on the topic of the country's entry into the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, the parliamentarian Evgeny Balitsky said that Ukraine's possible entry into the alliance does not guarantee an improvement in life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar
Barcelona and former Brazil striker Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker's move to Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without Themis' intervention.
Otherwise, they'll refuse him entry.
Neymar and his shrewd father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, have devised an interesting trick: under the agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he has received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counter-suit.
The Blue and Grenades insist that the bonus was for the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believe that the player was entitled only a quarter of the 40 million euros and demand the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barça almost agreed on the return of the "wild" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
The deal fell through, but the hope of a return pass from the forward remains.
And now, as Sports.Ru reports, citing insiders, the club's lawyers have told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial manner, it will rule out the possibility of the Brazilian's return.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.
Mart Laar: EKRE members will not be on the board of Bank of Estonia
The members of EKRE have not been and will not be invited to the council.
The composition of the Bank of Estonia's board is based on the conclusion that the Bank of Estonia has confidence in the Estonian government.
As long as the EKRE members have the attitude that they talk first and think later, none of them will be invited to the board of the bank.

At the same time, Laar noted that EKRE is represented at the board meetings of Eesti Pank.
The current seventh board of the Bank of Estonia includes, in addition to Laar, Liina Tynisson, Kaija Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Yaanus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Ann Listra and Reine Minka.
Two members of the council, Kallo and Tynisson, were to be replaced on Laar's proposal, with Laar suggesting that they be replaced by Ann Eessa (Centrist Party) and Ivar Padar (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Sutt to be on the council instead of Janus Tamkevi.
But Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Janus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would also be on the board.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members of the board of the Bank of Estonia.

How to increase future pension and not recycle
Not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-state pension funds are able to pay pensions.
NPF is a private company, according to Volgogradskaya Pravda.ru.
They work like a contribution: you make a contribution, the fund invests it, and over time it gives you the money back with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under uniform rules, which are established by federal law.
Pension points can be bought legally.
The number of points you have to give depends on how many years you have to work before you can claim your pension.
This is a good way for people who work off the books.
You can also contribute for a relative, such as a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about retirement at the beginning of their working life.
The increased pension benefits are available to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Far North.
To avoid depriving yourself of anything when you reach retirement age, arrange for this in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, put money away on deposits.
The most important thing is to keep improving your financial literacy.

It is noted that a group of 15 media representatives gained access to the fourth reactor control room of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as part of the presentation of a guide to the exclusion zone.
RT Telegram reported that the journalists were in the building for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the power plant still emit radiation 40,000 times higher than normal.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident occurred on the night of April 26, 1986.
12 regions of Ukraine and 23% of the area of Belarus were exposed to radiation pollution.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.
In July this year, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree according to which a green corridor was opened for tourists in the Chernobyl zone.
Also, the ban on filming in the exclusion zone has been lifted.
Earlier it was reported that the zone of alienation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the Belarusian side was opened for tourists.
Tour organizers have pointed out that a day in the zone can be less radiation than during a flight.

Which club will take the UDO released Paul Mamaev
Football player Pavel Mamaev, released last week from the prison for the UDO, will not return to the football club "Krasnodar".
The former midfielder of this club in the near future can sign a contract with FC "Rostov", - reports the portal "Championship".
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of "Rostov" and Mamaeva are now in the final stage.
The 31-year-old's contract is believed to be for two years with an option for another season.
Sport-Express writes that a day earlier, Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination at Moscow's Dynamo, but the check did not take place due to "an uncertain situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by mutual agreement.
The midfielder played for the Krasnodar club since 2014.
With the team, he twice won the bronze medal of the Russian championship.
Earlier, Mamaev played for Moscow's "Torpedo" and CSKA.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a trolley found in a dumpster
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he brandished a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a trolley found in the garbage.
Curtis Miller, 54, was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noted by Todd Beavers, who was out for a walk in the evening.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black trolley among the debris.
Miller saw Beavers' find and got upset.
He thought he could claim the wheelchair, since he was the first one to start digging in the trash.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran toward his house.
Miller then took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to chase the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller pulled a sword from its sheath and began waving it in the direction of the carriage hijacker.
Beavers told Miller that the whole thing was being videotaped.
Miller ran away when he saw the video camera, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside.
Soon after, he saw a strange woman enter his courtyard and take away his cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man has been arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
He did so in response to the fact that guests at a wedding celebrated at the same hotel where he was staying refused to give him a cigarette.
Mass riots on three .
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions is fragmented and losing political content.
The evidence of the "mass riot" itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political solution, to drop the case on the brakes would not necessarily result in the charges being dropped on the basis of a weak evidence base.
The case's closure should be a public delight, but it will surely leave the security forces extremely frustrated, whose efforts to fill the case with suspects and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Art. 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minayuilo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and after a few hours he was rehabilitated: the SCR dropped the charges against him.
Minyal was imprisoned for almost two months, and several professional groups - historians, priests, and literary figures - took his case.
After that, only two of the accused in the case remained for participating in the riots (originally there were 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, transferred on September 3 under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who the day before the court extended his arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court has sentenced the author of a joke petition about Latvia joining the US
The court of the Vitry region of Riga sentenced the author of a joke petition about the accession of Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
It says the man was sentenced to 80 hours of community service and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest part of our system", Bartecki commented on the court's decision.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than what is requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the site was collecting signatures for Latvia's joining the "Galactic Empire" and for the country's exit from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartetskoy under the first paragraph of the 82nd article of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
In 2016, the author of an online petition to join Latvia to Russia was sentenced to six months in prison.
A Japanese airliner made an emergency landing in Khabarovsk
A Boeing flying from Austria to Japan made an emergency landing at the airport in Khabarovsk, TASS reports.

Russian MIA proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has prepared amendments to the law "On the Police" to protect law enforcement officers from spreading slanderous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of police officers from "the dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including those of a discrediting nature".
It is not clear how exactly the police officers are supposed to be protected from online defamation.
The explanation to the document notes that the amendments will be applied "by way of individualization of the mechanism" already envisaged by the law on blocking posts insulting representatives of the government and by the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws went into effect in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussion and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the "About Police" law are to come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishing those who "openly disrespect the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of the violation and gives it 24 hours to correct it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for the repeated violation - administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition 76.ru.
Shortly after that, the Chudovsky district court of Novgorod region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for having posted "two posts with information in an indecent form, which insult human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the state, the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation".

Earlier in September, it was reported that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market - Sberbank - plans to reduce the rates on housing loans until the end of 2019.
Can phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
The most famous is pine pollen.
Phytoestrogens, on the other hand, have been well studied and have been shown to have positive effects on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular disease and some cancers).
Famous sources of phytoestrogens are all the beans (most popular - soy), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such supplements are not a viable substitute for natural hormones.
The possibility of harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, when taking them, the body's own hormone production may be reduced by the fact that too many hormones from outside are introduced into the body.
The rings called for the revival of the Kazakh "Zenis".
Former Russian national team and Rotor forward Oleg Veretennikov joined the campaign to revive the Kazakh "Jenis".
The club from Astana, which in different years was called "Dynamo", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Jenis", was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"I found out about the action for the revival of the football club "Genius", organized by its fans.
And I couldn't stay away from it!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It was not the best of times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who were always with the team!
I will always remember the Munaytapov Stadium, where I scored my 200th career goal!
The Genesis must be born again!
He's got a great history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their home club!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.
The Bastion complex has launched an Onyx missile at Chukotka.
The Ministry of Defense for the first time conducted a launch of cruise missiles from the complex "Bastion" on Chukotka.
Onyx launched from a range of 350 kilometers and flew 200 of them over land, which is a record for this type of missile.
The safety of the firing was provided by about 10 warships and ships of the Pacific Fleet, as well as aircraft of maritime aviation, reported in the department of information and mass communications of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.
The Bastion complexes have never been used on Chukotka before.
Hydrometeorological center named the right people 's signs
In Russia, there are many folk signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The weather service checked all the signs that were supposed to work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be trusted, albeit in the short term.
As Roman Vilfand, scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, explained, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be wet, as our ancestors noted.
And if the sky is white, it's going to rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
They're more commonly called swallows, if they fly low, it's usually towards the rain.
The explanation is simple: When the air is humid, the wings of the flycatcher become wet, forcing the birds to descend to hunt insects, reports TASS.
Different continents have their own folk customs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day one must observe the marmot as it emerges from its burrow to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeast Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been discovered on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The contamination was scattered over a thousand miles of coastline.
The first reports of oil spots were received on September 2.
But every day until Thursday, their numbers and territorial coverage continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted chemical analysis of the samples.
It turns out that they're all identical, and it's all about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, which was given the samples for analysis, said that they did not match the oil produced in Brazil.
"This is thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks are cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it probably got into the ocean current", said Rogerrio Almeida, coordinator of the oil workers union of the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba, to the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban, many ships continue to dump waste into the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states, conservationists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up the polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute advises tourists and locals to avoid oil spills and to report any contaminated sites.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matviyenko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to fully implement the draft law on guaranteed pension products.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another question how timely it is for us.
"In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has income, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future", said Matvienko.
The speaker said that Russians cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and accrual, as "the constant changes in this sphere have completely confused them".
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system, regulating its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities", - said V. Matviyenko "RIA Novosti".
The head of the Federal Reserve stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) is to develop, several basic principles must be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the preservation of pension savings.
The Russian Ministry of Finance announced on September 6 that it had sent a draft law on guaranteed pension products (GPP) for approval .
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, the registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man is staying in the Marvel universe.
Sony and Disney have a deal.
Image caption The news of the departure of the Marvel Universe's favourite superhero has angered many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to negotiate the rights to use it in the franchise's films.
This was revealed in a Sony press release, which stated that the third installment of Tom Holland's Spider-Man will be released on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on revenue sharing, which will see Spider-Man leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the movie hero are owned by Sony.
She leased them to Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony was able to make money from the box office, and Disney was able to make money from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point, this situation became uncomfortable for Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It's exciting that Spider-Man's journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is continuing.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world", - says in his press release.
Feige also mentioned that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built around Spider-Man.
"He just happens to be the only super-powered character to appear in multiple films.
So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may hold surprises", he noted.
Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted a clip from The Wolf of Wall Street on his Instagram account, in which Leonardo DiCaprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
The news of the company's disagreements came out in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted half of the box office revenue from the Spider-Man films, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of producing the films.
But Sony wasn't happy about that.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved Marvel superhero has angered many of the company's most loyal fans.
Details of the new terms are not yet being released.
As CNBC reported, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but stated, "We've had a great relationship over the last four years, and our mutual desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are happy to be able to move forward together".
Avengers: Endgame, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of world cinema, taking the top spot from Avatar.

It is worth noting that Vladimir Posner, Miry Matye (France), Alesandro Safina (Italy), Valeria, Soso Pavliashvili, Igor Krutoy, Zara, Tamara Gverdcitely, Denis Kliaver, Valery Syutikin, Dmitry Malikov, Maxim Pokrovsky, Yana Poplavskaya, Maxim Averin, Ksenia Alferova, Nonna Grishayeva and others took part in the video.
Most of the participants of the flash mob publicly support the aggressive policy of the Kremlin.
Vinnik became the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
The singer's press service had previously explained that the artist took part in the project in support of the International Day of Peace, which is celebrated on September 21, and did not change his patriotic position.
Let's remind you that there was a wave of outrage online.
The video itself is called mocking.
How can artists who have visited occupied Crimea, who support the policy of Putin, who started the war in Donbass, where people are killed almost every day, talk about peace?
Four men convicted of a series of dacha robberies in Khabarovsk
In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Druzhba, who for two years had robbed dachas in the "Cosmos" and "Rainbow" companies in the area of the Black River.
This was reported by the news agency "Khabarovskyi region today" on September 27.
The gang included two unconvicted men, ages 31 and 37, and two brothers, ages 21 and 24.
It was established that the inspirer of the crimes is the eldest of the brothers, who in his youth spent time in a colony for minors.
He robbed nine houses on his own, then the others joined in.
The damage from each of the thefts amounted to from three to 21 thousand rubles.
The criminals took away stoves, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, stools, and many other items.
The only reason they were stopped was because of a security alarm that went off at the last house.
The defendants are found guilty of burglary, trespassing, and causing substantial damage by a group of persons in a previously conspired conspiracy.
"The brothers were sentenced to 3 years and 6 months in a general regime prison, two other defendants - to 2 years and 10 months and 1 year and 6 months in a suspended prison sentence", the agency quotes the senior assistant of the prosecutor of the Khabarovsk district, Yuliya Vasilyev.
Medvedev: Kokorin is continuing training on an individual program
Petersburg forward Alexander Kokorin continues training on an individual program after being released by the UDO, reports TASS with reference to the general director of the team Alexander Medvedev.

In May 2019, the court sentenced them to actual prison terms.
The Kokoryn brothers were sent to jail for one and a half years, Mamaev and Protasovsky - for 1 year and 5 months.

The first MMA fights according to the rules, which was invented by Alexander Yemelyanenko, will be held in Moscow on November 29 - in the undercard of the boxing match between Yemelyanenko and the strongman Mikhail Koklyaev.
We lost the fights in spectacle, - said Emelianenko in an interview with "SE".
No one to look at.
So I came up with a new form of mixed martial arts, Universal World Fight.
The rules are three different rounds.
MMA is a sport that combines all the martial arts.
A mixed martial artist has to be able to do everything - and work in the stands, and fight, and work in the partridge.
First round is just the punching technique in the stand.
The second round is a wrestling match only, with a 30-second time limit for the partridge.
Round three, all clear.
When will the first tournament be held under the rules you've devised?
The 29th of November.
In the undercard of our fight with Koklyayev.
But it's not clear how many fights there will be.

Trade with Russia is not just tanks
Trade between Russia and India could double due to the geopolitical situation.
This was reported by the Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry Manish Kumar at the 5th anniversary forum of small and medium businesses of the regions of the SCO and BRICS countries.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, the Delhi guest stressed.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of these are small and medium-sized businesses that cooperate with the Shanghai Organization countries.
And we're not standing still, we're growing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general are just helping us all grow.
Our bilateral trade is now over 10 billion US dollars, but that figure can be doubled.
First, with new technologies in health care, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not only tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established its first contacts with the modern centers of Russia.
For example, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We signed a memorandum of understanding to create systems that you can build your modern business in.
Because entrepreneurship is not a whim, it's a necessity.
It's a necessary step towards economic prosperity.
We need to expand, to attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries we will definitely do this, - said the Indian industrialist.
We remind you that Ufa hosts the Forum of Small and Medium Businesses of the regions of the SCO and BRICS countries for the fifth time in a row.

During a working trip to Tobolsk, the governor of the Tyumen region Alexander Moor took part in the solemn opening of the Sokolovsky water reservoir after reconstruction.
Now its capacity is 25,000 cubic meters per day.
The reconstruction of the water intake was carried out within the framework of the implementation of the federal project "Clean water" under the national project "Ecology".
The authorities were helped by investors: Sokolovsky water intake became another example of using the mechanism of private-public partnership.
The Tyumen region has a unique experience of cooperation in this area between federal structures, regional authorities, local administration and private investors.
New artesian wells have appeared on the site.
They built pump stations on top of them.
Water purification and decontamination facilities have been reconstructed.
As a result, the Sokolovsky water supply will provide the villagers with quality drinking water.
The plans include the ringing of the Sokolovsky and Zhukovsky reservoirs.
Then Tobolsk will be able to fully switch to underground water sources.
Water treatment plants in Vaga will be expanded
In the Congress, in the conversation between Trump and Zelensky, they saw a "Russian trace"
The U.S. House of Representatives has accused Russia of being behind the scandal that was sparked by a phone call between White House President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The suggestion that the "Russians" may have somehow been behind the story was made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according to MSNBC News.
"I believe Russia had a hand in this", said the Democrat, but would not comment further.
Pelosi's Democrats, who hold a majority in the chamber, had earlier announced the launch of impeachment proceedings against the president.
It happened after an intelligence whistleblower complained to Trump.
The informant suspected that in a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump was pressuring his interlocutor to have Ukraine file a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, who could become Trump's rival in the election in a year.
The White House had to release a transcript of the scandalous conversation to Congressmen and the public.

Expert explains why you should avoid tea bags
A team of scientists from McGill University in Canada found that when a tea bag is brewed in a cup, more than ten billion particles of microplastic are absorbed in five minutes.
The packaged beverage may also be added to by the filler particles, said food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova to Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot be sure of the composition of the packaged tea - the producer may add ingredients that are not indicated on the packaging.
They don't throw away the sawdust at the end of the season, so it could end up in the tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the packets", said Tikhonova.
She says that it is better to avoid the drink and to drink tea with a little bit of the spice that is sold in specialized shops.
She also stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in its composition but also in the method of production - micro-particles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - the least additives will be in that drink", said the expert.

Regions were invited to share the secrets of supporting business
As it became known to the Parliamentary Gazette, on September 27, the chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the Federation's subjects on improving legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It 's time to build interregional ties
The Committee on Economic Policy of the Federation Council summarized the information received from the regions about their programs for business development and legalization of self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals for improving the current legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all the regions visited by the senators has identified the issue of the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole", - said Andrey Kutupov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available in the editorial office).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
Sharing information on successful developments in the regions could boost entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to forward the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy", the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate programmes to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Vologda region, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, which envisages the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar region, grants are provided to agricultural consumer cooperatives from the regional budget.
In the Orel region, a center for cluster development is functioning.
Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in some other regions, special measures are being taken to support youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to be brought out of the shadows.
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as this "most closely corresponds to the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments to expand the list of activities performed by self-employed citizens, including the types of activities for decorating and repairing residential premises, country buildings, conducting physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
In the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship are advocating for consolidation in the normative-legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific draft laws.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific law projects", - assured Andrey Kutepov.
The airline has helped passengers avoid neighbouring crying children.
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature that lets you know where young children will be seated when booking seats on a plane.
Now, if you want to be around them, you can avoid them.
Passengers on Japan Airlines (JAL) have been given the opportunity to take advantage of a new option and avoid unwanted neighborhood with young children.
The airline has launched a feature that lets you track which seats your kids will be sitting in.
When choosing a seat in the cabin during ticket booking, passengers will be able to see the image of the baby's head in the seats occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of the possible inconvenience of their crying may be able to sit as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services have been delighted with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier and said that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago, he was flying from New York to Doha, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested "adult flights only", expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they see nothing pleasant in flying next to a crying baby in an enclosed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with her infant tried to be nice to her passengers on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared bags of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with an apology note.

Pavel Ustinov joined the picket in support of the defendants of the "Moscow case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined the series of "Freedom for All" single picketing events that are taking place on Friday outside the administration building of the Russian president in Moscow's Old Square, Interfax correspondent reports.
The series of picketing began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
The protesters are now standing in turn, holding a banner with the words "Freedom for all" and the names of those convicted and arrested after the uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the names of Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglec, Evgenia Kovalenko, Konstantinina Kotova, Ivan Podkopayev, Aidar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minaylo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radjabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, and Vladislav Sinica are also included in the poster.
The Tver court of Moscow on September 16 sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a general regime colony on charges of using violence against a soldier of the Russian National Guard at an unsanctioned action on August 3 in the center of Moscow (part 2 of article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After that, on September 20, the court changed the measure of restraint from custody to a non-leaving signature.
For example, a petition for Ustinov's release has garnered over 112,000 signatures in a single day.
Theater and film artists have started a flash mob in support of their colleagues.

Supplies of sanctions to Russia fell by 100 times
The Russian government estimates that deliveries of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries under Russian food embargo have decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 442,2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reported.
The value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
We're talking about the shipments of goods that were not subject to the embargo.
The report notes that the drop in the volume of products banned from import was offset by an increase in imports from the CIS, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that in late August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited to import to Russia under countersanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decree on the abolition of sanctions applied to products from the USA, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein "joined" this list, and from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine was added to the list.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported "sanctions" (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow introduced in response to the West's anti-Russian sanctions) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions were maintained, the Russian Federation also extended its response measures.
However, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption weighing less than 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier called the destruction of food products "simply immoral", and this, in his words, would negatively affect the education of people.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for consumption was taken by Rosspotrebnadzor in early June.
After that, the Russian Presidential Council for Human Rights gave a similar recommendation to the government.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and we need to think about how to use them for their intended purpose, evaluating the quality.
Firm manager found guilty of tax evasion
By the judgment of the Leninsky district court of Cheboksary, the director of the LLC "Land and Right" Vyacheslav Morozov was found guilty of committing the crimes provided for in the "b" part of the 2nd article of the 199th of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (avoiding tax payment from the organization by including in the tax declaration information that is deliberately false, committed in a particularly large amount) and part of the 2nd article of the 327th of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (forgery of an official document granting rights and releasing from obligations, in order to use it, committed in order to hide another crime and facilitate its commission).
This is reported by the press service of the Investigative Department of the Russian Federation in Chuvashia.
From January 2008 to December 2009, Vyacheslav Morozov entered information about unfinished transactions into the documents of the tax account of LLC.
According to the false documents, the company incurred additional costs, and, therefore, the amount of taxes to be paid on the added value and on the profit of the organization was reduced by 11.2 million rubles.
Vyacheslav Morozov was sentenced to 3.5 years of imprisonment on probation.

Chile starts construction of a billion euro telescope
This was reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
As reported by ESO, this week the construction of the dome of the building that will house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project to date, officially began.
The total cost of the project is estimated by ESO to be over one billion euros.
Much of this money will be spent on the construction of the observatory and its equipment.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, which will be about 120 feet [39 m] in diameter.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflecting surfaces, each 4.2 and 3.75 metres in diameter, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed images of planets outside our solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to search for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has only just been built, scientists, engineers, and others have been working on the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory for three years - ever since the first plans for the E-ELT were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost amounted to about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
