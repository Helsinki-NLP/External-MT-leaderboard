The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the morning's sharp fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ's shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in the stock on Wall Street.
It also expresses the market reaction to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote that refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilization plan.
Asian equity falls
Asian stock markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the index eventually eased some of the losses throughout the day.
The Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong Stock Exchange throughout its trading day marked nearly four percent, although it later cushioned its losses by reducing the decline by practically 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with Shanghai markets closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Secretary of the Index fell to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions planned in the US are unsafe and this is influencing the financial market around the world", said the head of the Hong Kong Mint, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it determines its monetary policy on its own, i.e. without dependency on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloodbath of the American stock
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system, which should be allocated $700 billion.
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support their plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloodbath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell to nearly seven percent, a drop of a similar size last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retreats: US government can inject $700 billion into the banks
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed to a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
American lawmakers caused a gap in the talks over the approval of the bailout in its form of aid to the American financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it's not yet won.
Congressmen have to fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and have it voted on.
The financial system relief plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services and Banking Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
But then the 'de-enchantment' will be achieved by the complex mechanisms which will also help the market in practice.
The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolved our differing opinions regarding the form of the package of measures for market stabilization", Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give the government fund a definite shape.
The latter should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and also must be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it", said Paulson.
A Signal to Asian Business
The global financial crisis is specifically affecting the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, lawmakers are doing everything possible to get Congress to finally approve a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses before the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where the Congress could influence the trade of Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two houses of the American Congress will vote and, even, if they will not be stalled at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be passed in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its purpose, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage bonds whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be ready to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", commented Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and that he appreciated "both sides' efforts to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the shielded contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the program money for protecting taxpayers from its losses, a relief clause of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called 'shielded contracts' for directors of companies participating in the programme, and create a committee which will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards a convention that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", said Paulson.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to new mortgage payments that it purchases in order to lower the monthly installment payments burden of debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
"And that is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more important is that, as early as this week, the congressmen agree to support it and give it their full approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get this approval is, at the moment, the most important thing", Marek insisted.
Hand-to-hand combat: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends largely on the way it is used and on the requirements of the future owner.
It's probably going to be hard for me to get the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on.
On the other hand, these kinds of musical products like LP records are no longer available, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is no objective reason to continue buying them.
If you have vinyl records on your shelves with art rock, jazz, or blues music, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this kind of record player.
This is the same with music that's on the way, which is compressed, simplified music -- MP3 music.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as it is for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the 20-crown market helmets.
Two ends, between which there's enough room for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life.
Some of the best players do much more than just play music and even that which even most of the mobiles do not.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the most basic functions like telephoning, texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and can even navigate.
And when you take into consideration the smartphone and the PDAs, you're going to have in your pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to grill and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on your screen will light up asking to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy drains.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simpler ones) clearly have a higher performance.
So, please note that cheap cell phones will not play for more than two hours.
If, in addition, you are constantly called on to get a charger for your work, this is also true for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have, because even the worst ones hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only some of the devices have a universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly onto the memory card but only in some un-shrunken reader units can the small memory cards used in mobile phones be connected.
With the exception of some players (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only display a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Explorer and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows best
When choosing a particular piece of equipment, take into account the battery's resistance, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of handling.
If he listens to music as a background and he listens to it every day for a short time, like in the tram, then he can use any mobile phone that plays.
Which practically any mobile really gets.
He should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile phone or the music player plays.
MP3 is played by everyone and practically all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and excepting it the absolute majority of the apparatus play music in WMA format.
The less common ones include AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
The mobile internet is a simple way of visiting the relevant pages of the mobile operator (or any other service provider) and buying a song or album.
This service alone could be a compelling argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the themes of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this particular way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people have a cell phone with them at all times.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he will find the phone in his pocket, while the MP3 player will be left at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, the handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has practically every mobile at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobile phones with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three grand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can buy a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the lack of a classic headphone jack.
The best ones, even in terms of the technical part, such as telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their ease of use.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous cassettes or to the turntables is obvious.
It's not a threat in the sense that we accidentally connect to the internet with our mobile phone and, consequently, a gigantic data download bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) have as a general rule a slot for changing the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card, it will reach two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, check out Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 kroner is needed.
If you are among the most demanding music lovers, you can use the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman line of phones have almost identical use as a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category, about four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned above brings MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is due to arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer practically all the services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He'll probably be here any minute.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than those sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, you need competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already stated that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a conventional operator with its own network it no longer has many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find a frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant price drop, which also affected traditional operators.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market of Great Britain, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is a place for these types of operators and that they can succeed.
Other examples need not be looked for too far.
In February this year we reported on the launch of the mobile operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, Mobilking is backed by the Penta group, which is also the owner of U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order to operate effectively, they need to have far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not incur relatively large costs in building, operating and maintaining the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators usually profile themselves with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which however, is often countered with the offer of more adjusted services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a good bet to bet on a not trivial target group.
This operator is specifically targeting the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator you like and can trust", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as that of Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, the service provision is relatively saturated".
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region", Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation with mobil.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group which would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
'We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators with this possibility.
With some of them we have managed to advance in meetings", said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then perhaps they spark better times.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator should arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now, his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is a very specific market compared to others.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field", Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is referred to by other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional agreement with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, mutually beneficial, can continue to develop".
He adds: "On T-Mobile's network it will be difficult to find any virtual carrier until the end of the year.
We should have some concrete contracts on the table at this point, which could be studied in such a short timeframe".
Vodafone is focusing on the requirements of a 3G licence.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market if it is compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107 (3) of the Treaty.
We consider it to be the biggest contribution from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is to partner with a network to provide fast mobile internet".
Responsible offices - with the meat and nail operators
The progress of mobile operators is easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, which would lead to lower prices and, with them, lower profits.
So why make it easy to enter the competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to pull a single string, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by public information available on the CTU website.
But now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: 'In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened up to a fourth operator not long ago.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player on the market would place high demands on it and, above all, on its services.'
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries.
This is purely the responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tendering (ÚOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
The Commission has not yet concluded any agreements with the potential bidders, which were not sufficiently attractive to the traditional operators", added Kristián Chalupa, from the external relations department of the ÚOHS.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For the agencies which must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, it is also a matter of ensuring that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries where virtual operators operate normally, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the decrease in prices of mobile telephone services"
The pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the lowering of prices are clearly not in the interest of OHIM.
What is really dramatically shocking in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence, it comes up by itself.
It is the same with the price of petrol at petrol stations, because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
'The Office has found no evidence of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility for their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunication regulators", Chalupa added to his answer.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many points of conflict.
There is clearly an analysis of relevant markets by the CTU that the telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge, agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are rising in a strikingly similar way.
The current complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they encounter many similar impediments.
Charging the ČTÚ with responsibility is a fairly common trick in the telecommunications field from which the ÚOHS washes its hands of this whole matter.
We've encountered him before in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was recently introduced to extend the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial tendering, but it was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be perfectly clear to the representatives of the UOHS, but their interests are clearly elsewhere.
Everything is fine when no one's looking
At the same time, it is still working in a sort of unnoticed virtual operator, which already exists in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that set their own prices for mobile telephony services, but only a part of them is public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only a select few get the price list from these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will receive special prices and other offers afterwards.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If cases like the ones you mention were discovered, we could talk about infringement of the contract conditions which could lead to the end of the partnership with the company in question", Martina Kemrová replied to a question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity by mobile operators would not reach people who are responsible.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
The activities of these companies generate considerable profits and at the same time - unlike genuine virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of the potential problems: "the law allows such speculation, but the services of this company are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it at their disposal like a normal customer of the operators".
This is precisely what should seem to CTU to be at least a little strange.
There is also a new question for the SSSO.
If mobile phone operators turn a blind eye to this type of procedure, why do they block the entrance of the virtual operator?
It should be added that the OHIM has sufficient competence to detect this type of activity and if it is not willing it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this break-in.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, possibly, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the more advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in no case have they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator and with it, others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulator treats this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
We cannot but be impressed by our experience that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators let in a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
I listened to all four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations day presented the new official recording of the anthem Dónde, mi hogar.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are solo, one with male and female voices, one with choir and one with instrumental.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
Radio Czech has said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both of them and then, also, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance", he commented.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home was first played in 1834 at the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged to the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people embraced it.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What's the "new" anthem sound like?
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written into the history of Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers board the subway, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
It can now be purchased by almost a hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously charge it to their chip card at the infocentres and transport company stalls at the Metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The vouchers can be bought online from yesterday on the transport company's website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 people by the evening.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticketing booths in the subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue up to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window with staff who help interested people with online purchases and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card", said the project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to top up the electronic voucher in the Opencard at the vending machines in some metro halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a banknote machine and travellers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five in the city now but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
The bond is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
The electronic bonds are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the ring trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 which are used mainly by the inhabitants of the central Bohemian towns.
"In the trains belonging to the integrated transport of Prague there are controllers equipped with a card reader that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bonus", explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's cabin.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany him with the Opencard in the place designated for this on the side of the Box.
The driver then checks the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than to request the driver this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring buses and do not remember when their voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to join the U.S. in a referendum.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that Fumaba become part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter which is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in the year 1945.
It is from letters that are kept in a private archive and that are now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed by "the people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-eastern Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors urge in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies", the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of reprisals from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president presumably doubted this idea of the Shumavian Germans, it would be enough to organize in the Shumavian lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage.
Although the letter's text, with our current knowledge of postwar history, may sound a bit childish, according to some experts it accurately portrays the expectations of the Germans of the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least intuited that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is even confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and put him in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They thought that when they returned home, the check would come in handy", Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Bennes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This is how the Ministry of Transport decided to launch the emotional media campaign on Wednesday.
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on TV, radio, film, internet and in brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from speeding and from drinking at the wheel.
And also to remind you that before you go, you have to fasten your seat belts.
It wants to reach the consciousness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, lastly, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that push the emotions.
And the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign bear witness to this:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in big letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "payment".
This must symbolize that man in a moment of recklessness can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "scar" viewers until the year 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
He promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been drawn up by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"Drivers are entitled to the sugar and whip system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks", says transport psychologist Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And that is why we need an information campaign in the press and especially negative publicity, the psychologist said.
Less effective, he says, are the warning panels that alert the driver to danger.
"If there is a warning panel, it will probably soon blend into the environment and the driver will not pay much attention to it", warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied zones in exchange for peace.
The President of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has spoken about the restitution of practically all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all of the (occupied) land if not all of it", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will certainly keep a certain percentage of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic site" that lies inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty in the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work", he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
The European Parliament has also voted in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which it considers to be an essential precondition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the Golan withdrawal", he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
The European Union has a duty to support the efforts of the Palestinian people to achieve a peaceful settlement in the region, and to support the efforts of the Palestinian people to achieve a peaceful settlement in the region.
Questions after the accident: Is it illegal to have a flight attendant on the bus?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether flight attendants and passengers can move around the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the flight attendant is opposed to the law of road transit", says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed the 22-year-old flight attendant last week was evidently caused by the driver of the truck just crossing the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe seat of the vehicle despite having two other reserved seats.
However, the bus may crash or brake suddenly, and at the precise moment when the steward is delivering the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays a role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with pedestrian seats.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no places to go on foot, which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have resolved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally they removed it and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat", he told us.
The stewardess doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
There is no legal provision prohibiting transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle inspector, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less sharply, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"Depends on whether the bus is type-approved for foot-sitting.
That's all", he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing and speed-limited seats, intercity with standing places with a higher speed permit and long-distance buses with no standing places, with the higher speed permit and with seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert.
BESIP transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see any major problems with the movement of the coach on the bus.
"During the journey there is no danger, the situation can be compared with the service in the airplanes.
Even here you can't be sure that the turbulence will come and the stewardess will hit her head".
"However, if the bus suddenly stops, obviously the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the flight attendant must be resolved by the carrier's internal regulations", he says, adding that he believes that from the point of view of the law, this problem remains unresolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering flight attendant service.
He employs 200 men in it.
The director, even after the accident, considers that job risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will remove it.
The coffee shop and the newspapers can get it, the passengers, when they come in.
It would even save expenses", he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have flight attendants, we've been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A great tragedy has happened
In the accident on the line between Naples and Pilsen, a young stewardess who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably spun out of the parking lane blocking the bus's path without using the intermittent light switches.
His driver tried a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, and crashed into the front right.
Jančura denies that the two places reserved for the stewardess's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked".
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but will wait for the financial expenses also on the part of the guilty party.
Reform of the law?
Not for now.
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus on which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, no concrete conclusions have been reached.
They don't focus on buses, but on the points system, highway speed and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of flight attendants to be a serious threat to the safety of passengers", concluded the spokesman Hanzelka, who said that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is based on Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of West LB to its employees is full of great words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank's units with DEKA bank may form 'a central capital market for the Sparkassen financial group', as stated in the memorandum published on Monday.
Bank West LB, breaking the 'block of competition' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
Moreover, such a merger may be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is the way the text is understood when a board of directors wants to show its ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services, which has recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, there has been a lot of talk, also from the Frankfurt side, about a union of this kind between DEKA, which is known to Sparkasse customers for its investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA Bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, made it known that he sees no point in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which now consists of the regional banks and the savings bank associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with West LB about joint business activities.
This could be a capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just started, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time that the name of DEKA, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt, appears when it comes to consolidation in the sparkkassen area.
At one point in 2003 it seemed that DEKA could be merged with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans became public, the Hesse government spoke out against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks didn't find the same language either.
Instead, the RPGB started a dialogue with the RBA.
But the idea of merging DEKA with other regional banks was always played out.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba's board of directors, expressed that he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Independently of that it seems clearer that the union of the different banks of the public law field is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliamentary elections are due, the merger of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to merge continues to increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has fared much better in the financial crisis than the Stuttgart and Munich properties.
Sparkassen-und Giroverband in Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85% of Helaba, avoided coexistence plans with West LB at the beginning of the year.
In any case, it's just the Nord LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, there is the question of the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
So, also in the letter from the bank's board of directors it says that they would try to find a complete solution for the whole bank
How can we reconcile the coexistence of singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that's for the time to show.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians".
Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, he is attended by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is a huge bear tiger built that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can be produced in their throats.
First Elena gives Luca a little pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, heading for Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are provided for Italians, one bus is for Brazilians only.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
"With a lot of noise", says Marco Guarda, "which is nothing for Italians".
Marco, who wears a long coat with a faux fur lining and silver-colored goggles, owns these buses.
For five years now they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, considering that there are three excursions this year alone.
Night on the road there, day in the meadow, 10:30 round trip.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night, the buses are already on the way on the highway with the address "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Soon the bus is quiet, and the passengers are asleep.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates make another stop on the highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 am in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others get together, Marco has his last speech on the way forward.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letters is the page of Marco's travel agency on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the tent doors open, that means march!" shouts Marco at dawn.
March! March and take the back seats in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, spread all over the space!"
A liter of beer, ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you must arrive here!" Do you understand?
And now they're all going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on trees, traffic signs and even on an election poster of a great Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people making the journey over the Alps and tormented into the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers are assisted by the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries present, with the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (nearly 60) and Austrians.
The favorite shop of the Italian campaign is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed just last week.
However, the politician used the word 'relatively' and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that's after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier listed on the DAX, receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to help it withstand the turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters: credit aid has risen to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The reason for that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which now, because of the distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's cash capital reserve fell by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio fell slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared with the same period last year, the continuing income from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the income from imputation for debtors and certain securities and the income from the liquidation of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only the high and plentiful revenue from the reimbursement of the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and the business arranged for the companies of the consortium, could have led to a negative balance of approximately 16%.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier initially lost out on speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which was the reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As there was not much money to be made from financing state projects, Defa started to focus on infrastructure projects and financing community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now Hypo Real Estate has to make amortisation on the value of the subsidiary which will have a "substantial material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very imprecise.
It's a fact that they canceled the dividends.
By 2007, two-thirds of them were cancelled.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial player in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers, which occurred two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credit fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa's credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers the group's financing needs with a loan for a short time and the company is insured against "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to work"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of Hypo Real Estate, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and weightlessness of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that financing in its entirety may not be necessary.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
The rumour was that the bank was still almost insolvent at the last hour of Sunday, so the temporary bailout cannot reassure the least concerned people.
The share price dropped to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While the priority debts hardly change, the borrowing rates according to the position in the land register clearly tend to the downside.
The loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and therefore the loans with maturities exceeding 2009 are particularly affected.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculations must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, meanwhile it can start from the pension amortization within the term.
Or something will happen, which no one dares to imagine - the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-media news about partial statehood, now the already-bound security became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because the creditors will be spending sleepless nights, racking their brains over the decision on their enthusiastic insulation.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use carry over losses for next payments of profit shift compensation tax in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to present at the Highschool of Tachibana the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean? What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"First day at a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
I was scared before I went to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I'm on a 40 minute train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, but luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the pupils come, at nine-twenty a small meeting with the teachers begins, the 'home room'.
Before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since they still had their school uniforms, I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and a blouse, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this I stood in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
I was very happy because I had already started to study this language two years earlier.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered and laughed and gestured and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I've heard of it from my Mangas.
That's part of the Japanese girl survival vocabulary and means "mon, cute".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next to me had a big smile, and she was honored that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I felt really assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then at halftime, everybody took out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German bread pieces.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and something like tofu meat.
Most of the time I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new flavor.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, except maybe pickled plums in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl prepares a very artistic bento for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recess.
I read about that in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here as well.
"Why Japan?" my friends have asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he would always say:
"Well, because it fascinates me".
Finally, for years I prefer to read manga.
To better understand comics and culture, I started to study Japanese one day.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and custom.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a country of strict, disciplined and traditional.
Because everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life".
Rats have feelings too.
They say that a rat or a cockroach, feeling danger, runs away, why is it also afraid?
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
How can we control if they, behaving in a way similar to us, feel the same way?
An Internet magazine called "Edge" has been publishing the contributions of famous scientists for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else could not prove until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we go to other species and include questions about sensation and about consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what all other animals do - it acts dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
I don't think so, of course.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to pass on our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness in the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short-term memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is far more developed in the case of humans than in that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to suppose that even man is different from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in man's linguistic nature: Since most of his experience is bound up with language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's hard to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, can't be measured because it has special hardware, can't be analyzed by our experiences, then your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my talks are about the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
You could investigate the conscious processes of animals without regard to their contents, and that's what happens during short-term memory studies of primates, especially in the visualization example.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing passes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what does that do for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system, a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as for example the reactions of the body).
From this point of view, sensations are very much fixed in the cerebral cortex, which is what distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, fine sensory classifications follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others on par with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations are derived from simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brain stem, and Jaak Pankseep thinks the same, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network hasn't changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that is felt in two cases also like this: But how can it be controlled if rats and men behaving similarly feel the same?
Seeing danger, a cockroach runs away, but because it's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That's true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensation?
Even though it's possible to test it for men, how can you test it for rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to research rat emotional behavior rather than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is about special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, as the same measurements are taken of rats and men.
Because I don't investigate rat language and consciousness, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You can say I don't see past my nose, but I'd rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship together with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries".
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
The number of stages will probably be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed", said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will not take its eyes off us".
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA president Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European championship will not suffer from that".
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in the relegation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Counterattack by an indignant Dennis Quaid
She wanted to promote a new film, was speaking in an interview about her private life- and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and strikes back.
The long-overdue War of the Roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She didn't know the extent of his infidelity until after the divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version", the 54-year-old told the "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "sad" that her 16-year-old son Jack is again "going to publicly recall the pain and the changes, all that a divorce means to a child".
While Ryan is divorced and living alone, Quaid is newly married and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends his statements by emphasizing: "Be that as it may, my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine".
Airfare and hotel prices are dropping
In the first half of 2008 air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a recent study, airline tickets in Germany were even made up to 50 percent cheaper.
Airfare and overnight stays in hotels have become cheap again - these are the results of a study by travel services provider and financial services company American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a big change in the second half of the year.
After many years of rising hotel prices, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared with last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average by 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6% compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar, which was the cause of "the decreased interest of American tourists in travel".
The decline in hotel prices is also much more pronounced in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, setting a European record.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights became even more expensive by up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class airfares, compared with the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5 per cent, but price changes for business and first class were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more marked than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even dropped by half.
The reason for the price change is partly the increase in the economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit long-haul flights by airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussia's Luhukay to him still not out to make the goal of the decimoprimary.
Kristoffer Klein did a great job of the forced landing of the national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say, exactly reacting to what had happened, could be read clearly from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger at the entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the time of rest was over and most of the people were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That's why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant coach, nodded and lifted his fingers in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: "There, the second goal!"
But that was not done.
"Today was not all that pleasant to see", added Marcell Jansen afterwards.
Bastian Reinhard also wished to have it "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak team of Gladbach could not show all its strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
"That was a dirty victory", Martin Jol said in summary.
This Monday, the Hamburg SV will be celebrating its 121 years.
By Saturday evening the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the changing of the tables on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it", said Marcell Jansen.
It expects that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's strength than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-committed players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to come together, but still the team cannot shine with their successes.
"We need more than feeling and dribbling", Jol demands.
After the vote defeat
Wall Street is spreading fear.
Early news of the failure of the bank bailout package dropped the Dow Jones for a while to 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day points loss in their history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
At about 8:30 p.m., one of the world's leading stock market barometers was trading at a 5 percent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost over seven percent to 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest losers in the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
The Goldmann Sachs stock was down almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a major investor Warren Buffet had taken a financial stake in the company.
The rescue plan provides for the provision of funds to buy so-called 'rotten' mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid in one lump sum rather than in installments.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the share option receipts for the financial partnerships that during the development of the course can be collected to reduce the financial burden of the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the US continue to fall
The aid of one billion to the banks in Europe and the USA does not reassure investors.
The shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate are falling and are negatively influencing the Dax.
Despite the state's projected bailout of the financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones continues to fall.
Losses on speculative shares in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite the bailout actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier one time period lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets suffered a downturn.
The opening day of Wall Street in New York began with considerable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow dropped 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout bill, so the Senate vote could be on October 1st.
The other European balls also had only one trend: at the beginning the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia the leading Japanese Nikkei index after earnings fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to stand at 18,286.90 points.
In India the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase Arcandor's shares lost on the MDax.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the trade and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assist to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of relativity may not be so correct.
The Ulysses space probe spent nearly 18 years flying in space.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing, he now faces death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assist to the maneuver, causes the bewilderment among researchers.
Gravitational assist is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes as they gain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, say the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just as the Ulysses probe did.
But what has puzzled researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they frequently have irregularities in speed.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicists couldn 't explain this effect until now .
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assist maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity describing the attraction force of matter by the curvature of space might not be so accurate.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not get confused and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assist with the help of so-called dark matter, in what was left astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be dark matter that may also be very close to Earth", he writes.
Universe researchers have only known about dark matter for ten years.
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, meaning it doesn't emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light.
Scientists have calculated that dark matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions in ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a gunfight during the liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations regarding the rescue have already started.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently being released.
The same information is presented by Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Following news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
'We are now monitoring his health status,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reports.
All 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains unclear are the reasons for a gunfight before the hostages were freed: According to descriptions by an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom", said the guard.
It was just "taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six hijackers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to the report the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to remain in detention until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro Court Royal, through an investigative study, learned that he regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper, "I feel responsible for her death".
The court heard that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
During the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and wrap her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Ms. Rande's friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life".
In April 2007 her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in her Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande supposedly killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes with, "I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more clearly, if she had not done so, the matter probably would not have ended up in court".
He added: "I have noticed the effect that Stephanie's father and mother described the abuse on their daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful, happy future".
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet official who left some secret documents on the train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip for the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not give any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the sentence had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that relates to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service said that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee of Secret Services.
The forgotten documents contained classified information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Building societies face the price of B&B
In Britain, building societies could face a price of over £80,000 after the rescue/bailout of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government, in effect, provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all the companies using the savers' money, including the 59 building societies.
The general director of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently... are called upon to pay the price today of institutions that have been far less prudent.
The Commission has also received a number of comments from the parties.
This means that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the brokerage companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to recover £81,000 to meet the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, general director of the Building Societies Trade Association, told the BBC that this is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent".
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
'We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members against what could be a relevant price,' Mr Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk goes up by five pence a litre .
The people of the Jersey Shore will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations carried out by a consultancy firm.
The traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply the price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Bangladesh PM denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the military-backed government of the country grant her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina arguing that she could not get bail because she was already undergoing treatment abroad on conditional release", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are going to appeal the Supreme Court's order".
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fears for the polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - the UN says - have been unable to benefit from a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of officials while they were carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge at the Competition Commission following the decision requiring the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeal Tribunal that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously said that BSkyB's interests impeded competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antitrust Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV cast doubt on ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin's boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the compulsion to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, it said, BSkyB would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of US lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine American attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the performance by the officials of the administration.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation may have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved", Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the report's main recommendations was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it became known that the lawyers had not been rated worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the prosecution of high-profile Republicans in Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
And they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other officials in the Justice Department did the same.
The Attorney General's report is highly critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underscores how he had a "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably uncollaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 breakthrough album.
Coldplay are leading the nominations for this year's awards and making the ranking of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell, however, spent nearly nine years on the charts and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other roads, some famous, others just for service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The little street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street  before I found Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley rather than an active road.
There are no signs.
It's virtually impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has its fans.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to repave Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the buildings were appropriated.
However, the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Community Land Use Committee meeting this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in the city, called for a new plan to be submitted next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community No. 3 said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like to see Extra Place continue to be owned", said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street".
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seating, including some to be used as a café, pending the rental of the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area", he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is property development rather than property management.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a footprint on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, opens at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent", commented Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, signs, sheets, ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unaltered piece, a city gem that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk on the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusted-iron store doors and windowsills, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters".
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was curing through the back of the street and stood near the door that used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be given a clean up.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life", he said, "in dark, damp, filthy places".
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate of California Studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
Effectively reaching Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning outcomes, the Obama education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-language learners.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overcoming the distance in the final outcomes.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
At this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math test.
And an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English Language and Arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes revision and practice, constant evaluation of competence and no tolerance for any apologetic attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street principal, the school's approach to teaching English to students is "full immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the handling of the instructional content.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We've had extraordinary success with students like this one who has come from Mexico and that, if you come into the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to pick up what was".
"It works", he noted, "we think it works".
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the views of his party's politicians on the education issue (the National Education Association has long been a proponent of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is true that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You have to make sure that your child can speak Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than belittling or trivializing them.
Oil price plunges after renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Shares of crude oil fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, due to the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
The latest developments in the merger process confirm that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal "seem to have failed to rekindle market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, a decline in demand for commodities, including oil, is expected.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates is going to become increasingly uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter madness: team sets record
Having spent, for the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
So he saw things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a deflation game.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the shadows of the clouds.
It was at this point that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard touchdown and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of them when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't go out of my way", Favre said of all the steps leading to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think".
While Favre and Coles were playing on the dam, the Cardinals' defense was abusing quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a passing shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith threw another pass and intercepted.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to the foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls committed by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked it 20 yards to win a definitive 34-0.
That's the biggest score the Jets have ever made in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini, asked to describe the madness of this moment, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.
They've gained a lot of points in a very short period of time".
Gebrselassie rested tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proven what many consider to be the greatest runner in history, by beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the flat-trip race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has shattered by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, set last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length and has thus established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to race in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distance runners, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered a calf cramp two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy", Gebrselassie said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well".
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for the style of orchestrating his races too much, generally avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a racer.
This Sunday, with four Kenyan riders, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers decreased.
But just before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a clever calculation run, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do the head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Kenya's Elena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and trials of colorful living
Hidden by the sprawling theme park of Greater Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy, colossal city, lies a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are all too evident.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated town in the country and childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a jail".
It's now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - making it a tourist stop too by its inclusion in the Depression-era Federal Writers Project's Florida travel guide - remains a place apart.
The city remains as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who doesn't know what he's missing".
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told", said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level twice the national average.
It's a literary center, but also a restored example of the rural black South culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder the residents here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the town, just off of Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten middle of Florida into the black history and human drama.
With a face of cement both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Off the road to the left", he wrote, "is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, looked after by Howard Miller, as he can hardly read and write".
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transitional rooms".
So, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described him as he was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who sang colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that".
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston came to town, she would do so without warning in a big Chevy, smoking and wearing pants in a town that still prides itself on wearing dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora", continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was likely baptized, "she never stayed too long".
When Mrs Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville too seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, nor were there great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a bunch of white kids, they were going around town throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them", Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl once.
He was thrown against a watermelon from the car".
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel newspaper, criticizing forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honoring my race".
R residents today say that the desegregation of the schools, positive in some ways, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night", said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This continued, he added, until teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there", Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons black writers, actors and artists who stepped above prejudice, just as she did, with boisterous, confident and lines like, "How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand it at all".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed highway.
"The resurrected idea of the five-lane highway, would have been to put in what you would call curvature velocity, a real civic pride", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started looking back.
Eatonville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a newly landscaped and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street from the past under a summer rain, in a town as small as this one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
Advance permission is required to do most interviews, and some things - like the murals at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the fields - may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and self-confident teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community might be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a greater level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, dumb and mixed.
It's a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police department, which he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to come here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city".
Here in New York, everybody is talking about finance all the time.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the beehive offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 downturn.
Home delivery guys are still ringing their metal tea carts across the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins to breakfast meetings.
Latino men still drag between apartment buildings cargoes, like human mules, with 50 eccentric-print shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeout, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
Employees still wait in line for their bagels at the vendors' carts, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed like there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the gloomy forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a line of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek directions to Macy's department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker", and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, yet, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from which they had been commuted, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a building society), from the credit unions and from the savings banks in their hometown whose branches only operate within the state of membership, and which say they treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to bail them out.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is what most bailouts on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in the last few weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grieving-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was commenting on the matter with familiarity as if complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, the 50-something uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risks".
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria and Filip Dewinter from Belgium, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to introduce the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They have traffic signs that represent the mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, over some of the graves, but investigators think this may have happened in an attempt to conceal the true motives of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear if the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim clerics as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is gearing up for a round of introspection after the rightward shift in parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two far-right parties that garnered almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party which won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also expressed his opposition to food considered to be related to Islam.
At their last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change was mainly brought about by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued the travel ban last Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child molestation.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Magistrates Court in Ashford in Kent, but was represented by solicitor Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Magistrates' Service said: 'On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being on the sex offenders' register.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
You must also notify the police of your planned departure seven days in advance.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all the possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's citizens is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely with them to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimise any risk to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he caught a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He likely arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court in west London after Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source at the Home Office reported that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master off-scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels or flyers or opening night costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration on the performance to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman.
The artist's on the side.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, unconcerned because they will not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco".
With the flavor of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer started in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, because of the selection of the camera and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, conferring modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in their life, whether it is a long or short instant.
I think that in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or confront people, characters, who sometimes you don't even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that bears the title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the Mata street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa says the novel she's writing is "a recklessness"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and pours on unknown subjects, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to bring forward the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The all-time favorite to the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime", he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the theater's Juan Bravo.
Led by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to whom it became very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to supply his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and redoing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are sustained.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", underlined Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "makes people more inconform", so he asked the writers "not to abandon to frivolity" and "assume with responsibility" their vocation.
Climatology is killing the Pozoblanco fair, which is also running out of places to go.
The celebration of the regions that closed the ferry of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the corrida.
The inclement weather has been a boon to this fair, since finally two of its three festivities have not been held.
On Saturday, it was the rain that prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco lock-up.
So, only Friday was a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alexander Talavante left his two astados with a salute and an ear, which conceded more to the layers than his bull.
Of course, El Juli was even worse, who passed through the land of Los Llanos without any shame or glory.
In his second bullfight, after a relief faena, he won the ire of a large part of the audience.
They skip a checkpoint in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five ten to the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they start to flee.
His cargo, over two tons of hashish, was no stopping him.
The officers pursued them and detained one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public document.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Álava Traffic Unit were conducting a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the sand, at which point its two occupants turned to flee the race through a wooded area.
The police finally caught up with one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting, which they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bundles of hashish, so they proceeded to take it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" because it did not match the one recorded in the documentation of the van, so the arrested has also been charged with a crime of falsification of a public document.
The police continue the investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as it has been said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to police headquarters to conduct the corresponding duties and will be placed at judicial disposal in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was pumping the gas, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and in reverse gear he passed over his sunglasses several times".
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently hadn't recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear pull up on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because she was "concerned about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented", so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to run a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was ruled out from the outset, although "according to the officers' first-hand observation, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a treatment clinic in Arizona where he was recovering from an anxiety episode and a depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to take over its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making deals of favor to relatives.
"I for these things are very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competencies", said Llamazares on the action that the party should adopt with the one that until now councillor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into irregularities that Silva may have committed: "The IU has always advocated that this type of affairs have the maximum degree of transparency".
The Commission has also adopted a communication on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
'Blood of May', the epic wager of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of interpreters.
Sangre de mayo, with a filming time of more than two and a half hours, is released this Friday in theaters, to become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci says he has fulfilled with this filming "a childhood dream", which he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to surround with the decorated and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a Spain atoll that was wrong of the boss for which to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding like Alatriste or Goya's Ghosts - more than double that of May's Blood - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed along with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated for almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Volver a empezar, has emphasized that his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and whom he does not cast, seems to him "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's office lies in going to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar four times - of which won one-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the blood of may, Seven French billiard tables and finally selected, the blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that should be made known", he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect awards.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're settling for making one more movie", says Garci, who has been in the business for more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville is going to pay tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when he was three years old moved to London with his family.
She was a free-dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had a passionate life, pioneer of women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset which prevented women from free movement.
The life of this woman who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was incredible".
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of your dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic", she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was her student.
"Matilda plays the older Tortola, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that you agreed to play in my play and I'm very honored by it".
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all over Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence in a certain era and now no one knows and much less values her work", says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the granting of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
The "Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is thus coming to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Spock of Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less like it without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The quote is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absent Malice", and it gives the sense of the helplessness of American cinema, and of America as a whole, at the shocking thought that Newman is gone.
Look what they did to give him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
It's still been a rough ride for everyone.
"Sometimes the feeling is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of him".
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or to exaggerate.
A father of cinema and of the nation had died in a particularly dark moment, fearful of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem at its lowest, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When the time is so hard and the men are without virtue and there are few things left to admire, it doesn't take a naked Louis to love Paul Newman.
She embodied for all an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose to his brand of home-cooked, organic food.
A gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The shockwave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not a man died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing more than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us", said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who are trying, and Paul Newman is their example.
He was divorced once but then married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he probably had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why would I go out to eat a hamburger when I have a steak inside?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he's proud that on earth his daughters are matching his fans, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was more proud of him than that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics are held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we prepared?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and in my judgment it was the worst race by far that I've ever been in.
A heap of nonsense which, of course, if you took it as an assessment and I examined it, it would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go over it in parts and start from the beginning.
The mishaps start with the pick-up of the backpack, which makes you have to go earlier.
Which doesn't seem bad, but if they make you go, they'll give you everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, you won't.
Here you only had to go to pick up the backpack (first unnecessary, go only for that) and (after the relevant line), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second unnecessary, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only smaller T-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the day of the race.
Besides having to go early to pick up the chip, the line to get there is 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we had not yet left the backpack, although once we got it, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the waiting of more than 40 minutes, which was joined with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think that 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, won't even show up with the right time in the standings, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn't mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if you were to ask me about the perfect career, this one would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft showed a sneak peek of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of AI that isn't very intelligent but is able to perform some basic tasks, like ordering a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company campus) based on what it hears in conversation.
Using a camera and a face-recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the attendees according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he is not from the group she is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and says he'll be with him shortly.
All without the blue screen.
That was impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of their operating system, Windows.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has found that if computers came loaded with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial junk, they'd go five times faster -- man, Steve, it's for less.
Quite a find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came out, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to understand each other.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true, you know.
It will never go away, but you have to think of the death of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts up just to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windows environment.
What are half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating their online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll give you a little example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee restrooms in Redmond earlier this month.
At the soda machine, a sign asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather throwing in 2010.
At Microsoft, they'll probably be looking for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, is becoming more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to take its toll.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and it is part of the uniform of the gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate stellar appearances, we can trace it back to the image of that pointy-whiskered, heavy-lifting, weight-lifter in a traveling circus.
It is, in essence, nothing more than the typical men's cotton undershirt, strapped and sleeveless.
The 'tank', as the English speakers call it, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, because of her flamboyant name - though she is known colloquially as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport because it is said that she is named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian firm's production doesn't just focus on its tank tops.
Also included are college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear, though.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
Her strong resemblance to her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion business very seriously.
To Monica, they're much more than just pretty, famous girls who bear her name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins at short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we get a lot of references from that.
Then I really like to get lost in a city and watch women how they dress, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and they have a lot of bonds in common.
I've always loved clothes since I was little, and I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closet and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know how dancers like to make our own styles for class and rehearsal, to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you get the costume, that's when you really find the character.
So, it all goes together, that's right, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've just turned 30, have you had a crisis?
What's up.
I've never felt better. I like my 30s.
I find that women are built, have experience and savor life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me to be, and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're holding out for several premieres you shot last year.
I am, and I can't wait for them to see the light.
I, a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can't be.
I'm looking forward to the premieres of "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ".
Let's see what they look like.
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got on a runway to model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a while, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity fashion show for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - were being auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi's.
People don't know that Naomi's got a tender heart.
There's so much talk about her that, knowing her, I'd say a lot of it isn't true.
Besides, I get to keep that nice part where she gets involved.
You asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if you're going to ask me to do the pine, then fine.
For benefiting women in the Third World, whatever it takes.
Repeat offenders should install the 'alcolock'
The interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose of the training is to reintegrate the driver, who will also receive a course of road reeducation.
The experience will involve the Attorney General's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists who have been reported more than once for drunk driving take the car again.
The alcolock would prevent this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow out; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is greater than the permitted.
The cost is more than €1,000 and would be borne by the sanctioned party.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is linked to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, however, the necessary reform by the criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system in school buses, just as it has been done in France.
In Mexico and no 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., the time scheduled in the program, the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed at the presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating, but its rays still forced the hand to be used as a visor to watch the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
I had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Ah, that's very good.
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salute of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, wind-blown, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been informed that a storm was threatening in the DF.
They offer a smile and a brief pause to the photographers before moving on to the waiting room for the official procession.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, a journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The award for the best fashionista
There is perhaps no place in the world more appropriate for presenting a fashion award than Paris and there is perhaps no designer alive more exquisite and well-lived than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It carries a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango showcase at number 54 of the boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it's the second largest store of the firm in Europe and it just opened with 1335 square meters of floor space.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with a desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, made us end up with a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
With a broken heart and a broken heart, for the recent death of his brother, he put on a suit of the House and some ELAH accessories, which cut his breath, and from the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, lord and master of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had borrowed them from two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store in her own-designed pants and shirt and dressed in a long black sexy dress for dinner, was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a 'grand plie' spell.
Inés Sastre didn't stay for the walk around the palace premises, but before that he showed us on his mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to brighten the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry skies of Paris.
Oh there, that's the life.
1001, the stress relief number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 plus one ways to forget the chaos and frenetic everyday life.
And if that's not enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost punitive when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods for combating daily burnout and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has put together a whole 'menu' of possibilities in the pages of a book, adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress book is called 1001 Ways to Relax, and its calm will be coming to bookstores in the hands of Pearson Alhambra and DK Publishers.
If anyone feels that peace of mind cannot be achieved in such areas as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' dispels that belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talking in my sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean these people who wake up very excitedly telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens, you might be a little freaked out, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called somnaloquio.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you has heard that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often associated with other sleep disturbances, such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but this need not be the case.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
It's an understudied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a low voice, use loose words, murmur, or do the opposite (scream, cry, long speech, etc.).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, the child should be observed and a specialist consulted to check whether there is any issue that is causing great anxiety and giving it a way out.
We have said that it is a benign disturbance, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress pattern).
What you can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
So seek out quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who have great difficulty in relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a more restful sleep.
Once the sleepwalking starts, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if he is very anxious during several episodes, it is advisable to consult or find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not the case), do not be tempted to question him to get information from him.
You'll get nothing, because being asleep is not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Besides you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which much care in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell a child that you can interrogate him at night to learn his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path to victory on their home field after a long period of shortage.
Without having played a good game, the team created many scoring opportunities and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very consistent during this encounter in which the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who rammed the squad with a long shot, Illhaeusern was almost to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or also Diebold came to impede Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the midfielder through and left only Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening goal for the Illhousians with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the rejected ball on a first attempt from Diebold (53').
But the Illhousiens goalkeeper will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the dressing room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major scoring, the ball passed very close to the cross-country field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before departing for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour around Brittany.
The President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet his representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the increase in the prices of diesel, which marks a record by reaching 1,14 euros per liter.
According to the spokesman of the Elysee David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of the sailors".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to come to the surface.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Île have not been stopped.
A "filter barrier" has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantic region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday that will take place at the ministry to think about eventual actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials from the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen did not give up" and "they do not want to move towards Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per litre but believe that a ship can reach financial equilibrium only with diesel priced below 0.30 euro per litre.
The great Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of "Two Men and a Fate" has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the legend of cinema and the actor committed, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecast
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered aircraft, reaffirmed the president of Embraer, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell the aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would like to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been bailed out by the US monetary authorities, is planning to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its U.S. retirement insurance, the newspaper said.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to discuss a possible sale, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the company AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times continues.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of having the American authorities take 80 percent of its capital, diluting it to the proper proportion of existing shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris stock exchange
The New York Stock Exchange plunged historically last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss on the stock exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the leading technology index, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis earlier this week, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of a plan to save the banks that would have allowed the markets to regain some stability.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan", added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within days would be "too late".
"If the project is really moribund ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more ", warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
The Commission's proposal is to be amended by the Council, the Council and the Commission.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, triggering emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis", FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell by 3.632 percent, down from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year Treasury yield fell by 4.161 percent, down from 4.357 percent on the day before.
Obama, victor during the first televised duel
The first debate Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another debate to find out who won between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "enough 'brilliant' to allow him to curb his exit in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released last Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out on top with 39% of those polled, while 25% of them award victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow nominee, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts", predicted Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain brought out his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, underscoring the "naivety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first meeting.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that"... he charged on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the know-how to be president", he also asserted.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama emphasized that it represented the future.
Without being puzzled, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already understood", replied, this weekend, a Democratic television commercial that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans.
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for a rally in North Carolina under a pouring rain.
He didn't utter the words "middle class" or "working class". " Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable figure to save the economy that is on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive episode", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration mimbro, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a system of security and health.
McCain wants to build a 45-power plant by 2030.
Both candidates were cautious and avoided questions about the $700 billion bailout plan that Congress passed yesterday afternoon and is extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, "Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating on Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on the central square in Minsk on Sunday afternoon after the polling stations were closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator, he has to resign".
Some acknowledge not having voted: "Why, they will do what they want with my vote", says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime which made a good impression on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if the elections are deemed fair by observers.
Not according to the opposition.
"We were put alongside the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the vote counting", lamented Yuri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change", stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But his entry into parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and drafting of laws".
The opposition must therefore play the political game because 'dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts to Russia, enters into crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
The Commission also considers that the introduction of the euro is a step in the right direction.
"Have you noticed the elections?" he asks the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition members of parliament, those who best suit the power".
The silence of the night returns again in October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are congratulated on their success.
The interview - blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
And most of all, he regained the public's trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service has been contaminated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In view of this tragedy and the public's dissatisfaction, the Canadian government held a public inquiry in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horacio Krever, to clarify the circumstances that had led to this tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not be repeated.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his report, certain provinces then created a committee whose goal was to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all the other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system", recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained the public's trust", he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr Décary, however, points out that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing the emergence in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We are therefore relying on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, namely that when we do not know and when a serious disease can result from this, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we should introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But some years ago, it was proved beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense".
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, rather than the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used up to now were based.
The nucleic acid tests shortened the time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses could be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explained.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We can substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without us knowing and that we won't be able to detect them.
These improvements made it possible to reduce considerably the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in every 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before anyone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission from a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worry", says the head of the Héma-Québec administration.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion. Like West Nile virus, it is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
"The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which comprises on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood".
All healthy people over 18 years of age who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled in a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Misery is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to get people to donate their blood, but especially to keep them and to encourage them to be regular donors.
Since life is so unrestrained today, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood", laments Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for the great burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases like leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the bank placement of our thousandth cord blood sample and are expected to draw over a thousand of these per year.
We should start proposing it for grafts early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL first division elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in the final) against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the winner in the 90th minute of the match.
After the first half without a goal from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances for goals.
Roger Levesque was the one who busted Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the home-and-away series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon at the Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second round to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact are scheduled to face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the series details will be confirmed today.
In short  Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to take on the season.
The unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn cheered the offense in a 3-2 win by the Canadian on the barrier free throw against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec racked up two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor's fourth in six preseason games.
Kovalev scored the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warned the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable".
He tried to play to the maximum in the first half, scored Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a nice ovation".
Charest is dealing with the North.
PM does not rule out launching elections before year end
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ends, Jean Charest went to Juan-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
The Commission's proposal is to be put to the vote in the first half of the year, and the Council's proposal is to be put to the vote in the second half of the year.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc., were displayed.
Big media like during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks the elections will take place this autumn, although he made it appear that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth aspect of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which comprises a labour agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be developed more are: hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to Mr Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice the size of France", "is our home, it's in Quebec.
It's not just our home, but it's in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment in the event of accidents at work is a good one.
"It belongs to us, it is our future", he added, after having paused theatrically to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of Quebec territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government", he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North", he said, referring to the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory to be a duty.
What about the people who live in the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly the young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP for the Ungava party), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a grand cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's coming to power in the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois power station to the Adélard-Godbout reservoir.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future", declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European network of national and regional authorities responsible for the implementation of the Community's energy policy.
"This is between us, but I expect to be there", he told his supporters, to applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" which had no trouble being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular demanded the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for these to have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we greet the outlines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of personal data.
Quebec Democratic Action appeared to support the adoption of a government Plan Nord.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show", commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letras - A country without honor
It is Mr Vic Toews, the former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper government, who last summer allowed himself to say that Louise Arbour was a "shame" on Canada.
To dishonour this woman who fought a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says everything about the relationship between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government which is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, which has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events that are accused of him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The one who's messing with a fake justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
We should recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy" right now, that's the word Harper keeps repeating and it doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far minority wants (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free speech - the Orwellian discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world has filed a six million euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dared to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the case is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal arms, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to bankrupt the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to reexamine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by the exchange of ideas and not by the strokes of the garrote.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the question.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for Noir Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of the public?
The Vice-President said that the word seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, the opponents also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand, or does not want to understand, is that the public who support the authors and editors of Noir Canada do so primarily because they reject the brutal way of the mine.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (persecuting the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada, intimating them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surrealist rhetoric, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of academic pursuit and the pursuit of truth, which are essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be done following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to a reply.
The academic world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive prosecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It's a loss for the academic world, but it's also a loss for the public debate in Canada, and it's high time that governments put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democrat, finally agreed yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a decision on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment and the environment protection, and that the Council should adopt a decision on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets", declared Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to put the economy and ordinary Americans on the hook for the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"It's the bottom line: if we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", Republican Judd Gregg declared.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, but they did not forget to express their discontent at being forced to go to this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one about the salary of the heads of the surviving companies by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, they should not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary", he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that "I'd like to see the details, but I'm hoping to vote".
"The important points I read [shows] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we can move forward.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable".
The $700 billion plan is to use taxpayers' money to buy up the bad debt, risky and unsellable assets of America's financial institutions.
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more common forms of credit (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of elected Republicans who had the first draft deal changed last week.
We believe we've come out of the doldrums since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of struggling companies should only be insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to smooth over the rough patches for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would purport to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 billion more may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get shares in the bailed-out companies that will pay dividends if it makes a profit and that it can sell again when the storm passes.
The Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings concerning housing obtained under this scheme and to set limits on the remuneration and cash compensation paid to managers of firms affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to a vote in the House of Representatives today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this bill yesterday, both Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House finance committee, told his constituents that "by all evidence, Washington does not want to understand".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that involves taking advantage of taxpayers".
Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat who is a small-group cheerleader in Congress, presents the issues in a different way, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to say: we ask the Congress not to rush and to examine carefully the path to take", he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had another proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was refusing to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) during the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money wasted", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we got back a vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain".
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalise another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and the bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes have long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident would have also removed him from the power register that the true sacred monsters have.
What a great back runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last remaining icons of the American film industry of the roaring twenties.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he was very similar and who was considered for a long time as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the explosion of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No egos, the ultimate in quality.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self made man, the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in the theater, in television and soon in the cinema.
This civil rights activist was also the car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 hours of Le Mans, doubled by a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed in 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
And with him, the secret sides of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of the entertainment world that we don't know very well.
He's an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has left movie lovers in a daze this weekend as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of perpetually shifting American seventh art is paraded through it.
Many memories come back to him as the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to Us (1990), we evoke your sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that didn't deliver on all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
The bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's 1961 film The Hustler, he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 out of nine nominations.
This face that changes with age, that was him.
Still him.
Times change during your career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a rather unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as a godfather to the Irish mob in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Unlike many movie legends who abandoned their careers early, Newman stayed in the movie business for a long time, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its glamour and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in 'the underplaying' and that judges its over-supported performances.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallant than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, fucker or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed his true sensitivity to the not-so-well-known.
His 1968 film Raquel, Raquel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, depicted a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
"Among the many tributes unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former partner in arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly, "my life and my country were better off because of his existence".
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the late actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We've seen his face reign over boxes of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than settle for his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained these words: "From the beginning to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for your kindness.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a bright and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the forgery of documents.
According to the prosecution, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public and municipal funds - in total some HUF 65 million - were partly deposited in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly in the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also revealed by the investigators, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were fake.
The stamps were obtained from the Józsefváros District market and the circular stamps were manufactured in the town of Kiskunhalas.
The question of which company was to be the counterfeit invoice was decided, among other things, during the visit to the Upper Balaton region to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for his consumption and these served as a model to make the invoices that they presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Hall of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information wrote the reports needed to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this food centre provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the center's manager, there is not enough room for all of these people at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and no more than ten people could stay there in one night, yet the bill contained one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of fancy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the catering centre Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he already knew that these were fake documents.
"Our company name and the NIF number were wrong on the stamp".
He added that in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
Besides, the bill included meals, and the restaurant hasn't been open for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the chosen travel agency in Budapest organises exclusively trips abroad, so that they foolishly indicated on the cash invoice a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the invoice issuing practice of the agency.
In addition, as was found during the investigation, the document also included VAT, even though travel outside the European Union was exempt from tax.
The VAT measurement was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with 25 but only 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel staff only issued invoices made by machine but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "expedidores" made other mistakes as well, such as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out the transport by road which - it became known during the investigations of the prosecution - is not carried out by the company founded as an investment consultant.
The fact that the invoices were issued for Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont were also found to be false because of formal differences - the invoice was not in the correct format, the stamp was false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued these invoices.
The falsifiers also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group dined there (2001) Nyíregyháza HIB Kft. was in the process of liquidation, which is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously sent the invoices
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are those who were aware that they should issue false invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice in the amount of approximately HUF 4 million in the name of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Zuschlag and its accomplices also collaborated with Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, with no real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to state in their documents to this entity.
The next group of forged invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant against the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio SL, which had a fictitious registered office in Budapest and was engaged in the trade in fuel and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer media, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány in the name of the company, collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies operated effectively because - according to the accused - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, because at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices in the name of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, issued a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a total value of HUF 14,2 million.
The Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained HUF 500 thousand respectively from the tender, but did not use the money for the purposes of the tender.
In order to avoid detection, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the office search that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably tell at the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the forgery of the invoices.
The most interesting thing is the confession of the main accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done so far.
The question is: what is the point of doing so, because perhaps in exchange for the return of the bulk of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi would take all the responsibility.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of very high value, who never returned the money, walk free or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
The psychology of over-simplification: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neuroscientists and economists at NYU have discovered the neurological-economic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in the journal Science, people don't want to lose out on competitions like eBay auctions, so they'd rather pay even an exorbitant price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction, and the active areas of the participants' brains were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called the stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in the stakes is explained as a prevention to avoid provoking an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists in the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and they gambled.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
The third group, on the other hand, received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that one was highlighted for success and the other for failure.
However, testing the hypothesis of the neurologists, members of the "failure" group were willing to bet even more than members of the control and "winner" groups.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For until now, the auction phenomenon has been explained solely by the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now arrive at a third explanation" - stated Andrew Schotter, professor at the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor
Around five hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are receiving treatment because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for a number of liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar, liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are very different.
Pathogen-dependent hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through food (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal fluid, saliva).
Travellers are advised to protect themselves by vaccination against A and B viruses, there are no vaccines against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating the infected food, and are manifested by a bad general condition, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, the urine dark in color, and healing can take up to two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten of those infected receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know they are sick because this pathogenic agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms do not appear until 20 or 30 years later.
So early detection, systematic medical monitoring is very important.
Three groups are far more common: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattoo wearers.
Today, about 200 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be detected with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease is curable if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so that the contagion can be suppressed and the cancer prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by representative organizations of the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic viral liver infections and the importance of early detection.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that was also relieved by the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to examine how religious belief influences human pain, reports Britain's Telegraph newspaper.
In this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were given electric shocks while they all looked at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of investigations in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University participate alongside academics.
The analysis was as follows: a sparkler was attached to the patient's left hand, which was given an electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to fix their gaze on two paintings: the 17th-century Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady of the Snows by Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, who chose the oil of Leonardo because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a calming effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while looking at the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as "protected" persons, "calmed down and had peace in their hearts".
When looking at the religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image that is so impactful, you can get a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality", Wright added.
After these formidable results, only one question remains: What effect would it have on pain regulation if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his stature were shown to the faithful?
Would a vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say you are.
On its 10th birthday, Google can say: You can find it in people's pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they've spent their holidays, which doctors they've visited and what interests they have.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, the skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to fulfill the original goals of Google's founders: "gather all the information in the world in one system!"
According to the head of Google, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world upside down is still in the initial phase of the commitment to be able to process all information.
To the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt answered this: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would suit me best?" - however, software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet browsing, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages they went to when they finished their search are stored with precision.
Thanks to Personalized Search, for example, which debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-consult what they searched before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases it is the potential represented by the company that can be feared rather than remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that they not only keep, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information of its Web page, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
However, netizens who care about people's rights were relieved in May when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved to the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced by any of the constitutional provisions to provide any type of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to obtain under the guise of enforcing the child protection law passed years ago, nearly fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
So there is a contradictory opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy is harmed, their private life by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so its rival, the Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the world, much as both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that has been brought about precisely by one of the most talked about keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the communication channels available, and while the measurement of these varies individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal teenager can have profiles on numerous social media sites, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which lists their music habits, then adds them to a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and has a blog, where the latest photo galleries are automatically displayed, such as those stored on Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases where it becomes clear that for example the bride, by seeing the flow of photos of the next morning of common friends, finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion in his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life has been completely revalued.
A person's online life is what they show about themselves - this is the definition behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google's monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to avoid being found, but you can replace the Google "online" applications, from the text writing software to the image and news reading applications with alternative versions that do not connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public is almost openly waiting for the day when Google shows its true face.
The company's current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while the services that are being introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software companies.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example the top management flatly rejected the employees' protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare, they considered the unlimited number of employee feeding too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it is ready to work, what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years may be able to shake the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear their Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it could provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, the novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwellian fashion that future, in which a man from the data of Google alone can be described alarmingly well.

Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to well-founded suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said the spokesman of the General Commissariat of Public Order of the province of Borsod on Tuesday.
The young women admitted to the crime charged against them, and are currently accused of being advocates of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency, they are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity, they can get up to five years in prison.
The accused in the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared long before to commit the crime, because he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police are analyzing the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for 100 percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
The Polish State holds 99 per cent of the shares and within a few months it wants to sell 60 per cent of them.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the Polish bid was the highest among those bidding for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have all made offers.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that this would lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at between 5 and 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis as seen by the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a 'second 9/11'.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president - The Republic of Rome believes - the president has not been able to even get the support of his own party for the hastily drafted bill, which aims to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett has called it, it is more accurate to speak of a "second 9/11".
According to a section of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, it was the fault of U.S. political leadership that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then have repercussions throughout the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in mid-air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored, says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw a life-belt around a tottering financial institution, saving it from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if the dominoes crumble even more, then the new funds and the new improvisations will no longer be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must put aside their nationalist egotism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The crisis-hit financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, the Viennese newspaper Der Standard reports, adding that there is growing concern that European taxpayers, like the Americans, will have to pay a lot of money to resolve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping across the Old Continent .
The "saviors" will not have to come up with hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than by imitating the obstacle sensors found in nature?
Like the one with the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C robotic car steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space which actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
To replicate the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the laser-beam length measurement system.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor which immediately transforms into a collision avoidance maneuver.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot mimics the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by rotating the wheels to the required extent.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Lab and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should mirror what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process must be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike the bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here only used as a possibility for the robot of the auto the rotary movement and acceleration in addition to the braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life span than lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh says that the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, much less the ability to store it.
This apparatus must process only a few incoming signals every second and react accordingly.
There is no need to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes of memory, you don't need megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, within ten years will be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, bypassing the obstacles in his way.
This precious child has a name
The written version of the law of the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars has been prepared which will be implemented in several phases with the purpose of buying the bad loans of the banks.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to Eastern Time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made important progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the US Congress, saying that all that was left was to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's wheel.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m. Washington time (or before 2 a.m. on Monday, Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
The so-called Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 bill will be voted on Monday first by the U.S. Congress and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy bad credit union securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Treasury will buy bonds, bad-rated credit-fund securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the Federal Reserve Chairman will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit fund securities, in addition other loans of the "poisonous" type as well.
The purchase can be made at auction or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the portfolio finance guarantees the worrying items, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
The law thus secures the necessary financial means, which can reach even 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, whether it be the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We are doing everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks in difficulty and awaiting help from the State will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang calls simply golden parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limits depend on the form of support from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the failed bank's head retires.
By directly buying up bad loans the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that bosses' compensation is not overstated.
In addition to the above, the existing contracts for gold parachutes will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts in order to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that a legal limitation on the income of the CEOs will be in force - said the measure, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, since they may even make a profit from the transaction once the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill, in the next five years the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return to the taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there were reservations on both sides about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have entrusted to us, that is, taxpayers' dollars are not being protected - declared the Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, claimed the measures were urged by the very people responsible for the Wall Street meltdown.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008 the national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the prices of the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared to the prices of the month of August 2007 - reported the Central Statistical Office (KSH).
Industrial export prices increased by 1,1% compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent from the previous month and by 3.2 per cent from the previous year.
Industrial selling prices rose only marginally, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic selling prices in the manufacturing sectors increased slightly by 0.1 percentage points compared with July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices was recorded in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2,8%) primarily due to the increase of 4,6% per month in bags and belts and the increase of 2,5% in footwear.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials production branch (1.6 per cent).
There was a fall in prices in the petrochemical sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9%), and - to a very small extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1%).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
The other sectors of the manufacturing industry recorded price increases of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
The supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which account for a significant proportion of internal trade, increased by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from 1 July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the sectors of the processing industry - the highest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
The metalworking sector saw an increase of 13.2%, while the leading food, beverage and tobacco industry saw an increase of 11%.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5%) and in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3%).
In the other processing sectors the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
During the past year, prices in the processing industry worldwide increased by 10.2 percent.
Prices for electricity, gas, heat and water supplies were 18.7 percent higher than last year.
In August, among the various sectors of domestic trade, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
Prices in the consumer goods sector increased by 0.3%, while prices in the energy sector and in intermediate sectors were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increases compared to the same month of the previous year occurred in the energy and intermediate industry sectors (16.8%).
The consumer goods industries declined by 6.8 per cent and investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1,1% compared to the previous month and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3,9%.
The value of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year, you won't need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, to the Hungarians living there.
In his view, "virtually everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time, he warned that the new system will eliminate the entry requirement, but tourists will have to register before leaving the country of origin.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, presenting him with the Medal of Merit with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and hold negotiations with the international policy advisors to the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the financial rescue package for the banks.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two major American parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million bank aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Finance Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, announced early Sunday that a principled agreement had been reached on the financial rescue package for the banks.
The financial package to solve the Wall Street crisis and unfreeze the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, by putting economic issues in the foreground, Obama regained some advantage and McCain's advantage disappeared after the Republican convention with the candidacy of Sarah Palin for vice president.
At a campaign rally in Detroit last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal included those points of consumer protection which he himself supported.
"We must act now and responsibly (...) jobs, your savings, whole industries and the stability of the whole economy are at stake" - he told a crowd of 35 000 people.
He took the opportunity to call McCain's economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that "we're all going to have a hard time swallowing this . . . but doing nothing is simply not a viable path".
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of finance and the limitation of the executives' compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the most conscious voters have become - Der Spiegel says about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule Austria to prevent a black-and-white coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de) is a German newspaper.
In the electronic edition of the German leftist magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Parents" he discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
The socialists have been developing Bavaria for decades - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been anticipated for almost ten years was brought to an end: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU won 47.7 percent, the first time it had been below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU into the province devouring its progenitors .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but the pace was very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of Northern Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the voters became more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was the conventional groups of citizens who were the most distant from the CSU: the self-employed, the small industrialists, those with a bachelor's degree and the graduates.
The support for the CSU has thus fallen to less than 40%.
The press (diepresse.com) is the official
The conservative Vienna daily: "Who with whom?" in its article entitled "The party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confused situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, but the Greens are not yet ready to consult on the coalition.
The elections have been held, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely let their cards show.
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He said that they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era in any case.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would surely not be successful if Faymann attempted to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or will enter the coalition, these issues should be discussed without any doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of the government" - said Haider.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities has started in Paris today, hosted by France, which is also this year's acting President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of Parliament for the European People's Party (Fidesz), in her speech to the plenary, as one of the main speakers at this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations of Roma children and also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, the European social partners and representatives of the most important European organizations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, the Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The majority of young Roma have not completed secondary education and, because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible proportion can obtain a university diploma".
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in ensuring that other human rights prevail.
Investment in educating Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment against the adverse effects of certain substances on the environment is a very important one.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more chances he has to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and the abolition of segregated and low-quality education", Lívia Járóka said.
The Commissioner for Education, Mr Jean-Claude Pompidou, said that the Commission had already taken the initiative to set up a European network of schools and colleges.
'We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the chance to be part of a democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,' Járóka said.
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting to mark the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October , a decision will be made on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo .
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut in the Bavarian CSU leadership, and the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the moment.
Erwin Huber, party chairman and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary party congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo gave a hint: they don't hold on to their positions as much.
This was intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organisation, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union achieved 60.7 per cent, whereas now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they have only achieved 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although in the Southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a place in the small intelligence group that is starting negotiations with the FDP and the liberal Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange part of fate is that on the list of Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies in stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who had been the ruler of the country in the background, described 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor if they are not able to jointly promote the CSU which played a crucial role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the defeat, the CSU losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110 to 0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Lukashenko guarantees in the country, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million people, comprised of one hundred and ten deputies, has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF) hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his mandate for the fourth time after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the modification of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some opposition deputies into the parliament.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas imports and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow entry to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians because of a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed more emphasis on the positive phenomena rather than on the mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, Monday's OSCE primary report criticized even the campaign itself - in which the opposition candidates were not allowed to appear in the press - and especially that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the vote count.
The opposition feels that the political climate has improved: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, refusing to recognize the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has considered the two regions as independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said our newspaper Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime is afraid to allow even one opposition member into this weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning to organize protest demonstrations when they see the results, but rather try to get their message to the voters about the need to make economic reforms.
- This of course causes us a lot of problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see more and more those who support the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, not even the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime, consider it adequate.
The country's debt and growing trade deficit are only a matter of time before the social security system "looks like a graveyard of silence", Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but a testimony to the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you'll have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entrance and exit of staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against whoever signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This new feature was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services".
"A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening up.
This is reformism", says Brunetta again.
With the Chigi Palace, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, 'the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view'.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European network of experts to help the Member States in the fight against fraud.
In short, no more breakfast on duty; no more coffee and peanuts.
Brunetta's word, who suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a convention at the School of Public Administration
The Commission has also proposed that the Council of Ministers should be given the task of drawing up a report on the implementation of the European Union's policy on health and safety at work.
The Commission is also proposing to make the public administration more efficient.
"The Italian government has been very active in the fight against unemployment, and its main objective is to promote the economic development of the country.
By now millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the Brunetta decree's provisions by joining the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism due to illness  writes the association of consumers  the population of 'void workers' is continuously increasing.
There are actually millions in Italy of honest and productive public employees who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree".
In particular, the Council was opposed to the exclusion of economic treatment for sickness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions sought by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: 'Prevention is crucial'
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that the white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
The figures bear witness to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this tragic issue, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents in all the provinces of Italy, instituted on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of the mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment of the association to prevention at the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"There is a 'basta' that is sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, while everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work are particularly significant.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon under constant attention, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
The House's President Gianfranco Fini stressed that the phenomenon of white deaths was an absolute social emergency, which offended the conscience of each of us and required all institutions to make a determined effort to put an end to it as a matter of urgency.
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of non-fatal accidents is not as impressive", said the president of the Association, Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this 'declining trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention declines that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that, in general, too little is being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
The Commission's proposal is to be incorporated in the new Treaty, which will be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
'It is worth a further effort,' he added, 'in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it is a matter of a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli denounced 'the progressive deterioration in the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work' and 'the shift towards assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years'.
"The objective is to return the guarantee of insurance to the worker - he added  because the fate of the accident does not have to depend on the donation arranged by the legislator every time".
MP3 readers under indictment, putting at risk the hearing
Listening to music at a high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent damage to hearing.
The European Commission, in a statement released in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
"From this scientific opinion  it is read in footnote  it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than one hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high volume may unconsciously damage their ears irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence  follows the responsibility of the EU - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep up with the new technology.'
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to look into the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise that they cause.
The European Commission is now considering, together with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and related devices.
There is now a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concern is growing as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damages by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure time.
In its view, the Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable musical equipment listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week they exceed the currently applicable limit for the maximum noise permitted in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
The Commission's approach to Rome, Germany, is a key factor in the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bull" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas  tends to emphasise German  It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome on which the political decision-makers, the junta and the municipal council, can then rely.
There is no position of role, only the will to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March the work will be finished, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June, the intendant announced, 'we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome'.
The Commission is accused of being useless because its opinions are not binding, but Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission is able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is to be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics almost always gets crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn around and around manifest themselves.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and into the long term, into a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The Mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a trifle: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the citizens of Rome and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that express the capital".
For Alemanno, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which we absolutely need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
The Commission is also proposing to set up a European network of information centres to help the European Union and the Member States to develop their own information systems.
The first anti-American president.
He has written a famous American politician who is interested in passing as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, whose decisions reduced the US economy and its relations (as does also today the private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he won the highest office in the nation that has had two black governors and five black senators!"
They're attacks that don't really say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case too, there are those who speak to the heart but not to the brain.
An editorial in a newspaper in Mississippi, deep in the heart of the southern United States, said: 'Once we are in the voting booth, we will know for sure who the American patriot will vote for.'
It's a side of the American mind that's covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether it's on Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
things never said before now, that it seems almost certain the black candidate will succeed.
Yet despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people, what were the mistakes Bush made during his presidency? 89 percent said, Iraq.
He changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Iraq, too, for most has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes over for George W will have a huge job to do.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: newspapers are in a time of cutbacks, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of print.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
But today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Also, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the paper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today about the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printing against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are opening a gap in the Internet, seen by many as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has increased by 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "will do some good" for journalism.
The biggest rift today in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers -- the editors -- and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationally are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this is about "job security".
The number of executives who expect to lose their jobs in three years is 47% nationally.
For the news staff, it's 30%.
The "safe job" thing at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors are almost always paid well, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning gets complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his own admission, get "sick" often during the year.
It's all about the weather.
The Court of Rome, DANILO COPPOLA, is in the Great Hall of the Fathers.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation contract.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge , last week, he obtained the domiciliary release, transforming it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence accusing him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
We have confirmation from yesterday's New York Times reporting that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, ever more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, supportive of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to those in Washington and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become arrogant with the voice of the one who spoke in the beginning.
The above is just one example of the changes, the great changes, that the economic earthquake now taking place is bringing about, not only in the United States but throughout the West, and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe, the crisis has long acted as an accelerator of incubation phenomena which, with the new climate, solidify and emerge.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one which immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the hardship and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis is global economically but it is national politically and exclusively.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the question or they have little to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different state strategies and is unable to decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidization of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values which under certain circumstances no market and no organisation will probably ever be able to dispose of in the same measure.
This new emphasis on the nation state in the crisis is in perfect harmony with the greater importance that the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the web of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future would instead have to do more and more with the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly holds many more cards than whoever is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I get to the second novelty, but it's a sign of a fracture.
Who says territory, state, government, inevitably says politics and leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting of the existing leadership, of economically inadequate relief with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in growing numbers.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that rather than their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in the boom, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, is feeding underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in an "electoral revolt" or in the sudden shifts in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also coincides with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do).
It seems to me that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, some would say, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent what is now taking shape in the deep layers of Western society and which the economic crisis is renewing, increasing and potentially shaking to the limit.
In the face of all this, to speak of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on walls
Defy the laws of gravity with a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spider-Man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come pretty close.
With a glue of only one square inch, scientists have been able to stick a 300-pound body to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal's perfect grip.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the reptile's legs and at the same time it "easily falls off the walls", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitory adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Capes for walking on walls exactly like Spider-Man? Capes, yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
Further research - Also at the University of California, Berkeley, the search for a new adhesive is under way.
In an article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of hairlike micro-fibers that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juice
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the use of the European Union's financial instruments, including the European Regional Development Fund, to provide information on the use of the European Regional Development Fund and to draw up a report on the use of the European Regional Development Fund.
Grapefruit juice had already been under indictment because it was held responsible for raising to toxic levels certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine, and neurological medicines.
RISKY DRUGS  The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink if you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY APPLE  Experts say that orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
This is why Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan, said: "These discoveries are generally reported to the various international and national drug agencies who eventually provide information notes.
The Commission has also decided to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'pharmaceutical' in the wording of the directive.
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel prize for economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, in those days that broke Enron, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy and was blamed on economics for several years, but which has now been proven to be accurate.
I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has so quickly disappeared from public attention, Krugman had stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value" but also a "publicist with a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism".
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that looks to attract more and more users, from the home to the office to the public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are guarded by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the less coarse interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to the multi-functioning with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
On this front, "hybrid PDF" documents can be created, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud), and the final results should be in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the topic of free can be a hook for the dissemination in the homes, it is in the business field that Open Office suite test, tries the big bet, being able to already count with several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of companies offering training, consultancy and support services, which are ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises and which could open up business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows to work in the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl also tested positive. It's the fourth doping case.
A new case of the disease has been confirmed in the Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third in the standings and winner of the best climber's jersey.
The news is coming from the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth third-generation Epo driver to test positive, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in the last few weeks in the laboratory at Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-test confirms that he's positive, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will go against the two-year canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's positive doping test on third-generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has taken the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the best climber shirt.
Immigrants: New York Times is asking, is Italy racist?
Italy, a country of emigrants, has only recently become a favoured destination for immigrants, who are being received with hostility.
This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article devoted to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case demonstrates what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at once those that register "the most integration and the most work" but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
As proof of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightening the brake on immigration and facilitating the expulsion of the clandestine is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has called for the State and the Church to work together to combat racism".
Students hit by high rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The market for college rentals is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain" explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani  in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to such an extent to trigger a process of generalized increase even for residents".
Except that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, no limit of canon, sub rentals linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are necessary so that prices can be regulated by means of a review of taxation.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they serve about 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, they range from 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome in the central areas near the University ((San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) they ask you about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower prices (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save money only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the area of Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you get 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting to students and non-EU nationals is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively captures what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in the provincial towns.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the big meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono salles in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
"It's as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom you shared a piece of space and so much emotion", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the Oscar and the grand prize of the jury at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the main association of the merchants, Anec, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the biggest losers are all the cinemas in the main cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 fewer in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the multiplex avenue is responsible for its disappearance, it is precisely these three Italian regions that have registered the greatest number of new cinema screens: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian exercise has developed irrationally observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of the merchants: the previous state debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
The sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about the closures, decided to take care of it by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the single-screen cinema in the historic center as well as in the periphery.
The rules include tax relief measures for managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking fees.
'It is an initiative that I like,' observes Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example and put other measures in place.
It is true that to counter the extra power of the meticones, traditional theatres have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had already thought of 10 years ago.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale on Via Nazionale, which are now closed, where I've shared so many emotions, I turn around to avoid seeing the posters blackened by the dust.
The link between politics and the 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to unify the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cause".
The charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested are Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the boss's namesake, who has already been convicted of mafia association and must pay 10 million euros in damages.
"Despising any legal and moral norms, and of good sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family - the judges write - would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality's interior, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "there are a lot of agreements between organized crime" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep clean".
The arrests this morning add to those last July after the police announced the beheading of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been removed from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Udc's mayor at the time of dissolution, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
I exploded a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
I called in question the vice-minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3 highway.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families".
When energy is born from waves, the great ones come on stage
It's an extinct deposit that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and it's being discovered now by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that the big guys like Chevron are looking at.
The possibility of harvesting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put on the backburner, but now that environmental issues and the new oil surge are giving the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that by 2007, 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by implants that exploit the movement of ocean waves.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants today.
And then there'd be the currents and the tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in the north of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies those who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology", a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is looking into the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US energy commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a rather important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to drill for new oil.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicates a rising interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a huge environmental impact.
So far, impacts like the Portuguese or the Scottish are small and don't seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, you have to use a technology with a greater environmental impact.
And there are a number of options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected together.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside the boas.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
The electricity is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
There are currently four implants of this type under development, awaiting federal approval alone, aside from the energy, it could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using subsea turbines on New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides, causes the turbine blades to spin, creating a rotational motion that powers the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, say the Institute for the Development of Electric Power, is the potential of tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It's mainly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that are approaching the coast, have invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are planning an investment of 35 million for 2009.
