Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well established, but it also provides details that fossils are not usually able to provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feather color was a warm-toned brown on top with a pale cartenoid hue on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a developed plumage, called the checker, but have other features of feathers - fins and eyelashes - the researchers concluded that the checker was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal rather than a plumage of a chick.
The researchers have suggested that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows plumage from an adult rather than a chick.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It's found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The amount of light and the spin are used together to determine a star's Ross number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the number of Rossbys, the less active the planet is in terms of magnetic reversals.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The impact the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides to ebb and flow, the milky way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter in the galaxy's environment is around the galaxy in a kind of shadow, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally an experience of simple technology: voters are isolated in a booth and put a pre-printed paper in an envelope indicating the candidate they are voting for.
After the officials verify his identity, the voter sends the envelope to the ballot box and stamps the ballot box.

Candidates can send representatives to serve as witnesses at any stage of the process. In the evening hours votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Police Major Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adakoya has since appeared in court in Edinboro and has been charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting conviction and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be flawed since her photo went public.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and courts have seen the publication of images as something that could cause bias.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that it seems that journalists are indeed willing to take risks if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Justice Department, which handles all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be given until at least conviction.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border conflict, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
It was determined that the additional pesticide trial shootings should be under the close supervision of foresters, as the experiment is under supervision and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
"In partnership with the Parks and Wildlife Service and the New South Wales Sporting Rifle Association, we are recruiting qualified volunteers for the Sporting Rifle Association's hunting program".
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting attempt received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli yesterday appointed a new nine-member provisional election committee (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth C.E.P. in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the previous provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime crackdown that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, flared up over the non-existence of elections, which were due to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated have been reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of global warming, which the company had deemed non-serious".
"The firm responded by calling Apple's rejection of the report "very unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Unit has confirmed that no injuries have been reported in the state.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the cameramen took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research the subject of premature birth in his spare time.
His study showed that taking a hormone would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
"Singapore News Agency reported that government investigators found black box flight recorders on Wednesday".
Fellow fighters also shared his honor with Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first queen of the Hacks, my first manager, Luna died on the night of two moons, unique just like her, a strong woman".
"Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was a freak like me... maybe even more so... I love her and I miss her...
Of the 1,400 people who responded to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the British Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome his pain because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
And a few people confirmed the discovery using various materials and software in early February, and the message went out on Tuesday.
It could be that comets were a source of water reaching Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed the bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as chatter and political nonsense".
Speculating he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA is charging that will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older, more land-based technology, to allow flight controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information".
No vehicles will be added and trains will not stop in Wombley, and parking and ride facilities are not available on the premises.
Concerns over lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will be held behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer, due to the crossing of an endemic Darwin's gecko (Geospiza fortes) with the giant migratory cactus gecko (Geospiza conirostris).
You can shape gold into all sorts of shapes. You can roll it into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin thread, which can be twisted and folded. It can be ground or flattened into strands.
"It could be made very thin and glued to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts".
It's called the pH of a chemical.
Carbose juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH was determined by the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet, clean hands, make a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange feeling and a kind of peeling.
In the Arapa√≠ and Muangodara villages, there was a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and the centurions of Greece.
Baths were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, the baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and mirrors.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is to give us a much lighter and faster means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much larger smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a nest, a special role each cat fulfils that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males, along with no less than 30 females and pups.
The females are usually closely related, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave very similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other large cats), and as such are particularly lethal to their prey.
Being highly athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (the panther type) as the lion, the tiger and the jaguar. These four cats are the only ones who can bark.
The roar of the tiger is not like the mighty care of a lion, it is more like a sentence of words shouted in eagerness.
Octopuses love to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, almost all of which are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that otters find prey and track it by scent, by smelling the ground they've passed.
They can see perfectly well in the dark through night vision, and they can also sneak around silently.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
In this new environment there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than those that were previously required to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations they had before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means creating a new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Moosaurus was the supreme predator of his time, so he feared nothing, except other moosaurs.
Its long jaws were pierced by more than 70 sharp teeth, and a second set of teeth at the top of its mouth meant that anyone caught in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mussels, and he may have even been a cannibal.
Plus, it attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't resist it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have some odd or unusual items to celebrate, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called the neman.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to host a banquet where they were rubbed on the side while they ate their meals.
It's impossible that ancient Roman meals included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, a temple that was considered the house of the god.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner temple into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple to the Lord.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was of little consequence.
Most of the Jewish family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open windows facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his travels westward he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each of the countries was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen a national treasure movie, you might think that a treasure map is painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days, the large card document (29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was scrolling for storage.
So, it's likely that the additional mark is simply a label.
The Normandy invasion landings and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, who were Frenchmen who had collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and had sided with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines in some way the size of society.
Cities are the breadwinners of nations. Civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge between several generations, a cultural footprint and a relatively large distribution.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as real civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, because it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
And it had no authority to circumvent the tax laws and customs between states.
A regulation must be unanimously approved by all the states before an amendment could be added, and the states treated the central government with such ease that their representatives were largely absent.
"The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion".
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honsh≈´), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of the archipelago of Japan, it is often defined as an archipelago from a geographical point of view".
"The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilya Formosa, or Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which caused a change of traditional grain cultivation practices and the employment of Chinese workers in its rice and sugar mills.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1912-1644) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was reclaimed and the recovery continues to this day.
"For example, the world's most common still film format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era".
It's still made today, but more importantly, its height-to-width ratio was inherited from digital camera image formats.
"The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high".
Therefore the ratio of the width to the height of this format (twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family) are equal to or close to this latitude-to-length ratio.
The Rule of Thirds, which has absorbed the seeds of ridicule and abuse, is a simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective place for the central subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertically and horizontally triangles (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, was under intense criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Its penetrating power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the central beliefs in Christianity is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle had been preserved.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, and it blocked vital military and civilian supplies, although this siege violated the accepted international laws enshrined in a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has been mining international waters to keep ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
In the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to submarine warfare due to its lack of borders.
During the 1920s, the prevailing position of most citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horror and horrors of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
"In 1884, Tesla moved to Arabia to take a job with the Edison Company in New York".
"He came to America with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China had its own way of representing different time periods; each stage in Chinese history or each ruling family was a unique dynasty.
Also, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between the dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this time, there was a fierce war among many nobles who fought for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted them, allowing the ambitious and the most successful to succeed.
That's true of the military because instead of ranks based on rank, they were now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He would often command a cave known as the Ka'ra on the Mount of Noor (light) to immerse himself in a deeper contemplation".
The cave itself, which has survived through history, provides a very rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all even if you know it exists.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
"The upper rainbow mark looks like a V and the lower rainbow mark like a pin from the trigger or a square without its lower rib".
Up means to start at the end and push the bow, and down means to start at the bow and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the notes are there for a musical purpose, so stick to them generally.
On 6 October 1789, the panicked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Th√©r√®se aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly transported to Versailles by a mob of showy ladies.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open wide the windows of their chariot.
At one point, a man in the crowd blows his head off a royal guard soldier killed in Versailles in front of a frightened queen.
The war costs of the American imperialist conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a substantial part of the expenses and interest on debt securities raised in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period of time in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The peak of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technology-driven or technological dictation to a heightened sense that human destiny is based on reasoning derived from the laws of nature and their reflection in technology.
"Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology develops in a way that is not heavily influenced by culture or politics, and that technology has effects on societies that are intuitive, not socially conditioned".
For example, we can say that the car is necessarily leading to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide network of roads is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed in an effort to lower the cost of car ownership.
The proliferation of private cars also increases the frequency of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health field to repair bodily damage.
The Romantic movement included a large element of cultural determinism inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pieta and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures associated with this geography arose, and these, thanks to their harmony with the place of society, were preferred to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its publication as a luxury incense began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
His status declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk cloth and spices that were priced higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress was deeply influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow-moving media, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the countries of Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Sustainable agriculture is agriculture designed to produce enough food to meet the exact needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses seeds preserved from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Throughout history, most farmers have been farmers for a living, and that's still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures cluster together people with similar views who feel discarded by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures generally mark their membership with unique use of symbols in a style that includes fashion, gardening, and slang.
One of the most common ways to emphasize the importance of socialization is to learn from the isolated, sad cases of children who, because of neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, did not experience socialization by adults while growing up.
"Some of the children of the wild were confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred because of the refusal of the parents to accept severe mental or physical damage to the child".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were bred by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
When raised by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (with physical limitations) almost identical to those of the animal that has been raised, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the Pygmy method goes one step further.
Pygmies are not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The pajamas can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of pajamas but also the little paper trigger in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Pygmas are embedded in software and are designed to ask, respond to, and explain challenging processes that students may have difficulty coping with on their own.
Children are sent to foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We think of the foster system as a safety zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health services.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken in the past.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that learning and socialization are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal engagement and long-term relationships were also identified as new motivational factors by Amy and Corde (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites".
The use of video photography has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that attract a few milliseconds.
And in particular, it's claimed that you can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, noted how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior are common to animals like domesticated dogs.
Studies from the 20th century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection erases it from the already marked diversity pool.
Segregation and recombination mix the differences back and forth between the two reservoirs with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most common plant resources were the available proteins in oils and peanuts, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, it should not be surprising if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same ways that chimpanzees use in the savanna today".
Sleep apnea is a process of deliberately falling asleep during your normal sleep time and going to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on the biorhythm of time involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known urinary) before bedtime, which forces the former to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is.
The only thing that separates him from our goals are our tensions and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but this has been expanded by the MahƒÅyƒÅna's way of love and by many techniques from Hindu yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the Kundalini, yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is evoked through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and the imagination.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the divine being. Through visual thought of various divine beings the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, the contradictions of systems, processes and cultures led to a rift between the countries".
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
"It took place over the next 40 years and the actual fighting was carried out by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places".
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, as more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep moving your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first seen domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for convenient access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were in many cases children or adolescents, similar to the better known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were constructed from only parallel wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the more rugged roads of the period.
The cross braces were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it gradually became clear that the rails would be more effective if they had a steel bar across the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron further hammered the carts' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first tracks made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of mobility was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as frequently as they did.
The ability to walk on two legs was found in Australopithecus fossils from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although the coelacanth may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's exactly like symptomatic therapy, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that problems have been compounded by humanity's overpopulation and dispersed lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Sleeves".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
Sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap scrolls still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T. Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one or two values, i.e., 0 or 1, these numbers are treated as binary numbers  or bits, depending on the professional computer language.
Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open medicine can or or open bottles of household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this toxin.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted to a great extent to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both bed bugs and mealworms are nest-builders who have adapted to living in their host's nest or home.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), so it's still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Trachoma is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have a common cold.
A couple may decide that it's not in their best interest, or their child's, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to have an adoption plan for their baby.
When you adopt, the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, underpins most scientific research.
But it's not the only one -- an experiment, and an experiment is a test that's used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and performing observations also conducts scientific research.
"Naturalistic philosophers and naturalists focused on the classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible".
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior that are often critically dependent on the presence of internal circuits, and are produced by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining timers that will continue for a certain period in constant cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They did two experiments where we labeled the DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in cells from the germ layer can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to work and pass other people who think that's where they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is in some way connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same amount of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems suffer such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the field that studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to stay within a consistent range of logic; therefore, the traffic flow generally has a logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To represent a flow of motion better, we have correlated the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide from the crazies.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterflies and the hummingbirds.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite was true; that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with eight times more water flowing through it than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows through the Earth's tunnels into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
"The central Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no structure has ever surpassed the Giza pyramids in size and constructional excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populated country.
The Vatican City Council uses Italian in its legislation and in its official media.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, developed the theory that everything was composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also argued that they were transformed into new materials to create what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and calcium are considered metals.
You can also get an alloy that contains small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, when it came into use, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil's status and use declined.
People are now writing messages on computers, and they never have to go near the edge.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
The fission of the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no push.
The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
"The thickness of the film is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side".
It's thinner under the surface and thicker under the surface.
There may be more lunar bodies on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding the same factor that motivates or spells people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are instilled as they grow older.
These theories examine what it is in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can break out when people become the managers of their former colleagues.
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make him theirs.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups are required to the same professional standards as regular groups, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as liaisons with their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understandable to their local management.
"The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The invisible team is the management team to which all team members are subordinate. The invisible team sets the benchmark for each team member".
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an organization for learning?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and productivity can emerge.
As a result, a process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, so it narrows the field and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build blood models that help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI evokes strong connotations of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and cognitive adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence includes the development of machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been implemented in several home computer programs and video games.
Tours play a big role in every classroom. Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or marvel at fine art while sitting next to their classmates.
Sharing a virtual shared trip is also a great way to look at the trip and share future classes in experiences.
For example, every year, students from the North Carolina Bennett School build a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year the site is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a memorial book.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy and sloppy spelling, audience presence usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to aspire to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Equally, using blogs may empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' writing, as well as shape their own perspective on certain issues (Oraver, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a variety of galleries and museums representing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the home of the pristine natural beauty of the Muscova region and beyond.
All of these and more make Ontario seem like an outsider to a typical Canadian city.
Large areas to the north of there are relatively sparsely populated and some are barely populated wilderness areas.
"A comparison that surprises many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadians".
East Africa is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of the great apes, and a continent unto itself in all things wild.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or linked to France, and are known as luxury coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it bought a large hold on the Comoros and Miot.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery by Portuguese explorers Vasco da Gama of the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It's also advisable to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would see as harassment, and that it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their arms, and so on.
There have been attacks on male rejection, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourselves (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
"The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the tenth century BC, and used the Phoenicians, Romans and Maronites as a strategic port called Anapa".
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida and it received the name of Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the Old Country it's easy to find places that sell traditional handicrafts, such as tadpoles, pottery, leather goods, carpets, and a whole range of small items, but all for the benefit of tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo far to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Niranjangou, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the downtown.
Goma may be relatively safe, but any visitor outside Goma should check to understand the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Mount Nirongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest trails in Africa following the mountain gorge.
You can use a bod-bod (motorcycle taxi) to get around the dome. The usual (local) price is about 500 Konglese francs for a short trip.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to serve as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling city, though it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and its airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
"It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates special on PBS's Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
"The park spans 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different wildlife".
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are two daily park maintenance and entrance fees.
You may also want to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to select parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where Rabin tourists refer to as a major focus.
The line of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a sparkling bar chart that is revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour Water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon coastline opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in developed land along the northern coast.
It's where the British settlers saw their place, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
"The Sundarbans is the largest free-ranging mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast 80 kilometers (50 miles) into the interior of Bangladesh and India".
"The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park".
But the forests are not just untamed swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
"The Sundarbans forest covers 3,850 km, of which about a third is covered by water areas or grasslands".
The Sundarbans has been a haven for wildlife since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave the Interprovincial (cross-river) bus station during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and Jaker/Bomtang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-county buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese NGL) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese NGL).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint Georges de l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters and two lanes of three and a half meters wide.
The bridge has a minimum clearance of 15 metres (49 ft) and was completed in August 2011, and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian Customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guaran√≠ were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and the Paijua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"The 16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the vast province of the Indians, was born as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players who are some of the best in the world.
The big tournament of the year was held in December at the polo courts of Las Canitas.
You can also see tournaments and smaller games here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, look to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is defined as equal to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound will be accepted everywhere in the islands and inside Stanley often credit cards and US dollars will be accepted as well.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, although British and U.S. money may be accepted. Check in advance with the owner to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so they exchange money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer in the northern hemisphere, it's winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than it looks.
"There are no defined wet and dry seasons: rainfall remains constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
No matter how comfortable they appear, bison, Canadian deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance properly.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so do not wear scented clothing, do not cook smelly foods, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Aipia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
"The harbour was the site of a famous naval dispute from 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour".
All but one British scout ship was sunk, and nearly 200 Germans and Englishmen lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mao movement, a peaceful mob in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Topua Tamasse for the Third Election.
There are many beaches, as Oakland stretches across two islands. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
North Shore Beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by the pohotokawa trees.
The banks of the Tamaki Drift are in the WaitamatƒÅ Reservoir, on the expensive shores of Mission Bay and St. Hilarus in central Oakland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a great variety of shops along the beach.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The additional local beer is called Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more resistant to travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are thirsty, bottled mineral water is very easy to find.
To Australians, the concept of a flat white coffee is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino comes with plenty of cream, and tea is served without milk.
Belgian standard hot cocoa, expensive but excellent fruit juice.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these factors are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cuban jellyfish appear near the coast and in the river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can be found occasionally outside of these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being in the headwaters north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace and security of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the invitation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay on site, and most attendees see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you'll need to get in early to find a campsite in the backyard near the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage may have ended, there may still be areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cell, as ice crossing causes quite a noise in the cells most exposed to it.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements.
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood and to keep them in the area.
Some places offer alcohol on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy dirt roads, friction is low and you can't drive as you would on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, enough snow to make you freeze can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or blowing wind, or by haze or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
The Soli safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a headline for many travellers.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow them to be observed comfortably.
Lions, cheetahs and tigers are sometimes shy and can be seen better through binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called bushwalking, backpacking safari, or jogging) consists of a few hours or days of walking".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and overnights before the cancellation was announced, you may have run into a problem.
There are a variety of cancellation policies, but since late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover until July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with most tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing moisture-laden clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have a freezer and ironing board available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there's no ironing available, or if you don't mind ironing socks, you could try using a hair dryer, if it's available.
Be careful not to overheat the skin (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, a burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of different filters is not constant, and if you have any concerns, you might consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown to them from their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually defined as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are tax-free and exempt in certain places.
Travelers who come to countries with high taxation can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Upper Pittsburgh Freeway, and it often passes through desolate and isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are many steep steps, narrow paths, and sharp bends along the way.
"The posted speed limits are substantially lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) - and adherence to them is even more important than usual".
Strangely, the cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other sections of the trail, like the wilderness areas of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common. Apple pies can be found all year round while cherries and plums come in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually especially suited for a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what we call according to the different regions Berliner, Pannochen or Karpfenn.
Curry is a dish based on spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
Curry can be dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the mainland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curry preparations; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
But when used without further explanation, the term refers to food that originates in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, and the prominent flavors that Javanese people love are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
Riding frames provide support for the rider's legs hanging from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot becoming entangled in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the saddle, he can be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with smooth, stiff heels and soles.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rear-facing rider.
Cocochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and large granite cliffs.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly building new trails within the infinite potential of the walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating down a snow-covered surface using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major outdoor activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bells, who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5000 BC!
"Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened in Norfolk, Australia".
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski tourism, or ski trips.
It is related to but usually not included alpine-style skiing or mountain-climbing, the latter performed on steep terrain and requiring much harder boots and skis.
Think of the ski trail as a trail similar to a nature walk.
In good conditions you can cover greater distances than by walking - but very rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on trails trained for it.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries requires going through the visa and passport check process many times.
The Shangan region, on the other hand, is acting a bit like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in the area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, so we save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what goods are considered antique. Certain taxing bodies define goods as being over a hundred years old.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be considered antiques, though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The cultivation of northern elephants is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people and the surrounding culture. This hand-loom is also important to many other occupations.
But even traditionally, not all the Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they were fishing, hunting and things like that, and they kept reindeer mainly as beasts of burden.
Today many Sami people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami Sami region.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word gypsy is often considered offensive because of the associations it raises with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people".
If the country you are visiting receives a travel warning, this may affect your health insurance or your airline insurance.
You should consult the governments of other countries, but their advice is for their own citizens.
As one example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a particular country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and overly abstract compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous climatic phenomenon that may cause damage, serious disruption of social order, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can survive anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and raging fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, tidal waves, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal effects of severe weather are strong winds, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of severe weather affecting the area as it may interfere with travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be defined as a war zone should receive professional training.
"Searching the Internet for a hostile environment course will likely yield an address for a local company".
A regular course will include all the topics discussed here in more detail, usually alongside practical experience.
The course will typically last between two and five days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender labels or documents that have been updated to fit the desired gender and gender varies.
The difference in the willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as great.
Security checkpoints have also become much more invasive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people before surgery shouldn't expect to be able to pass through the scans without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Retreating currents are the flow that returns from breaking waves on the shore, often in a reef and so on.
Because of the underwater topology the re-current is concentrated in a few deeper segments, and a fast current to deeper water may form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue, due to trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head for a place where you won't get caught again, or according to your skills, if you're spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it lasts less than a honeymoon), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a hard time adjusting back to the culture they were born into.
When you come home after living in a foreign country, you've adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrived in a foreign country, people were apparently patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in new countries need to adapt.
People may not expect that it will take as much patience and understanding from travelers returning home.
The light-sound show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the voices of the tourists and the vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The sphinx serves as a background and as a number of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, is claimed by several countries and has the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located about 120 kilometres (77 mi) north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estr√≠as.
The others include Livingston Island and Dispensation, where the lava-laden crater of a still-active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula merges into the plain, then re-emerges to form the 200-mile chain of the Ellsworth River, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which rises to an elevation of 4,892 m (1,980 ft) and is Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as research missions that require remote data communication and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should provide you with additional information about subscribing to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a vacation is to travel and study.
It's especially popular with high school seniors, and it allows them to take a year off before college, without compromising their education.
"In many cases, enrolling in a course during a bridge year in the sand may actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education in your home country".
A tuition fee is usually charged upon enrollment in such study programmes.
"Finland is a great sailing destination. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands, lakes and archipelagos along the coast".
In the archipelago and the lagoons, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelagos of the largest coastal areas and lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
It's similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but beyond that it's unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most special Baltic Sea cruises include extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It means you can visit the historic city for a few full days and go back to sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only arrive at the coast by boat, you will not need a separate visa (valid for 2009).
Some cruise liners have Berlin, Germany, marked on their billboards. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they've never flown or experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fear or aversion that many people feel about other things.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight may help overcome the fear that is based on uncertainty and lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Time is often a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some of the routes the larger companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they were airlifting, on some routes unloading and clearing customs could take days.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as registered cargo.
The obvious way to fly business or first class is to pay a large sum for the privilege (or better, to have your workplace pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay for business class up to four times the usual fare in tourist class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there's no point even looking for discounted seats in business or first class on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destinations quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
"In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment and declaration of independence of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states".
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Samarra, today it is a modern, thriving commercial center, surrounded by a mighty bay and mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldresvik has views of the nearby island of Estroy and has an unusually rich church.
In the churchyard there's a statue of a pigeon over some graves.
A stroll through the village of curiosity is worth half an hour.
A short distance to the north you will find the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which was made known to strangers by Lord Byron's glowing description of its beauty.
Scouthorse bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo de Roca.
To the north, you can visit the great residence of Our Lady of Fatima, where the world-famous apparitions of Mary took place.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, and also a site that has almost unfathomable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or enslaved to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the respect, seriousness and dignity it deserves.
Do not deface the site by signage or graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost all know Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan because it is legally designated as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular messages in the metro are delivered in Catalan only, but unplanned outages are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, insolent and conceited.
"Although often it is just an inaccurate stereotype, still the best way to get along in Paris is to behave like a model, like someone who is bien √®lev√® (well-educated). It is very easy to get around the city".
The Parisian's cheeky exterior will evaporate quickly if you introduce basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly by ash, ash-wood and ash-wood, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an especially wide variety of plant communities, due to its diverse microclimates, soil types and water levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, deer, owl, moose, wildcat and giant squid can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide cover for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the door.
In the same spirit, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
Again, you can ask the store at the entrance to the lounge, the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Moorish cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Middle East, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A popular and simple dinner, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, pumpkin and any available additives such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All noun phrases, including the word sie in the meaning of you, always begin with a consonant, even in the middle of a sentence".
It's an important way to distinguish between a number of verbs and nouns.
This is arguably easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used as a noun complicates the writing a little.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, because the pitch changes with the movement that follows.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: stealthily means expensive, and carro is a car.
Persian has a relatively easy and usually consistent grammar.
So reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Of course, those who know a Romanian language will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people with little knowledge of Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it would not be necessary to learn it separately.
Today's postmodern observatories are generally outdated, left as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as nami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
Japan hosted the cherry blossom parties for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial court.
"Plants look their best in their natural environment, so they managed to pick even one flower".
"When you visit a formal garden, the sampling will cause you to be removed from the premises without a hearing".
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and very quiet to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
"But when you're located in the tropics a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less often)".
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering traveling on goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Keret Four.
Inland waterways can be a good base to base a vacation around.
For example, a visit to the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or a cruise along the Irish Channel.
In addition, they set up routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it symbolizes the birth of Jesus.
Many of the customs associated with the holiday have been adopted by unbelievers in Christian countries as well as by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter without sleeping in a bare spot to watch the dawn.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very possible that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Sunday services on the Saturday of the Easter weekend, and congregations often break out at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been brought to the island, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in winter, you'll experience a polar night, which means that the sun never rises above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the skies will be more or less dark throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, so light pollution is usually not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that of ordinary Westerners.
Suits are standard business attire, and co-workers call each other by their last names or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, and the emphasis is on team effort rather than individual praise for individual accomplishments.
Employees often have to get their superiors' approval for decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
