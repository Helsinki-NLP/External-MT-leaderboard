As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the COVID-19 case count reported in every country worldwide, obtained from official sources only such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities as well as WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 am.
The data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare the data with Italy.
As a proxy for the active spread of COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the latest 14 days cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, therefore taking into account the natural route of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, during the period 1 January 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to the number of cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend in the latest 14 days of cumulative incidents of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Region (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative incidences of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (Additional Subsection).
This is largely driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, however all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar upward trend for cumulative incidents of COVID-19 (Additional Content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
The Commission will also review the progress made in the implementation of the new rules on the protection of personal data and the protection of personal data.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.

Although countries are at different levels, diversity in national public health responses and possible case definitions vary by country as well as different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 validation, including follow-up testing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).
The data should be collected in a systematic manner to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of well-treated and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
11 = 12.5 beds of care and intermediate care for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010.
The modeling scenario related to healthcare capacity deficit, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK for the spread of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with > 90% risk exceeding the orderly treatment bed capacity, is provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment on COVID-19 by ECDC.
As cases have so far formed clusters in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally handle a clear area population concentration, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided in Tatanama for regional units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the progressive community outbreak scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 infected patients requiring healthcare, especially intensive care, as is happening in affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized in recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is important to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, moving from a containment approach to mitigation, as the expectation of a rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their responses appropriately if not implemented earlier.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health care measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity where countries have the possibility to continue to improve their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the stress on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA national healthcare systems will face an increase in patients requiring thorough treatment in the coming days or weeks.
2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in disaster for humans.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and has the potential to be more powerful than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on 7 January 2020 that identified the target of the virus isolated from some patients.

We'll also discuss what we've learned so far about prevention and prognosis and some other important questions.
CoV has traditionally been considered a harmless pathogen to humans, usually responsible for about 15% of common cold 4.

COVID-19 is the third recorded COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.

As the situation is developing rapidly, the end scope and severity of the disease have not been established.
As of 11 February 2020, a cross-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided more up-to-date illustrations of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 individuals were infected under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average braking period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of massive movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large, sheltered viruses containing a single strand of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, cth., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among all the alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to the cellular receptors of angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) and peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
Virus RNA genus is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of virus genus, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then attach to the plasma membrane to release the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of beta-CoV with over 99.98% genetic identity in 10 reference samples taken from the disease's origin site, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and protein overcodes encoded by orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and have an IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of human ACE2 is fully at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which has open and closed validation, has been combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for co-protein scattering and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Ji, et al., suggested that snakes be a carrier of the virus from bats to humans involving a homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the ant-eating long-horned mammal - which has always been used in traditional Chinese medicine - is a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in CoV found in the ant and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the 1% difference scattered across the two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, the final decision to place concrete evidence is awaited (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SRAS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 45 days below 20 °C and humidity 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.

So we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, after a virus invades a host, the virus is initially identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as type C lectin, Tol-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Although different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation and type I interferon cystesis (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigen macrofacts.

T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus and CD8+ T cells continue to kill cells infected with the virus.
Helper T cells produce pro-radical cytokines to aid the immune system.
Covid can inhibit T cell function by causing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity including supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infection.

The average estimated shrinkage period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, typically 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
Nevertheless, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as stated above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.

Febrile is usually the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied without any other symptoms or symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately escalates to acute respiratory syndrome, septic epilepsy, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.

A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed breathing assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from spread from asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.

Switches (26%) and sore throats (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are major symptoms and respiratory aid has been required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.

Previous studies reported that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged between 2 and 4.
Comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and disease RO is shown in Table Table 1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to transmit than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less fatal than the two diseases.

The patient has a normal or decreased number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aminotransferase aspartate levels and viremia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.

In severe cases, the level of D-dimer, the degradation product of fibrin in the blood, has increased, and the lymphocyte count has decreased significantly.
Abnormalities in chest x-rays are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by bilateral cluster shadows or soil glass congestion in the lungs.
The patient usually has atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid fluid buildup and fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytosis dysfunction decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, while reducing the lung's ability to develop and increasing the risk of lung failure.

On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte squamousness, formation of the hialin membrane and penetration of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleated synthesium cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to the pathology of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through transcription-reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate, which may have exacerbated the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory testing and radiological discovery is important and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.

Hopefully, the new technique will significantly increase sensitivity and convenience if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with novel CoV, doctors can generally provide supportive treatment to COVID-19 patients, while attempting various therapies that have been used or previously suggested for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Even plasma from patients who have recovered is also recommended for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs in the initial stages and may also attack, at a lower level, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.

Respiratory support is therefore essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives as well as include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary imaging technique used for the treatment of cardiac or respiratory failure.

Cytokine bubble is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
The cytokine triggers immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine thunderstorms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine thunderstorms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF restriction; JAK sequencing; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC sequencing.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.

Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Based on these observations, Gilead has given the mixture to China to run a pair of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Switches, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be closely monitored.

True, patients who have recovered usually have relatively high levels of antibodies to pathogens in their blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralizes them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 patients who were in serious condition.

TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends heavily on the combination of various components in different formulae according to the diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or blurred as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combination.
Today, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe levels.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in some provinces in China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatment.
They found that the time needed to recover from body temperature, loss of symptoms and hospital treatment was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still awaiting more controlled trials on a larger scale and at more centers.

Mandatory contact detection and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel more worried and guilty about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people in contact with them as well as the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with constant and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human areas to susceptible hosts and usually complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine to generate long-term and effective neutralizing and/or immunizing antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
Directly debilitating vaccine has been tested in animal models for SARS.
The efficacy of these vaccine candidates in vivo in elderly individuals and their risky challenge models as well as their protection against zoonotic viral infections should be determined before clinical trials can begin.

In contrast, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East as well as spread to other regions due to persistent zoonotic resources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particles such as viruses and recombinant protein subunits as well as some have been tested in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgently needed task and is essential to control the ongoing epidemic.

As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without re-infection.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Building a prognosis model for the disease is therefore important for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 usually occurs in the age group of 30-65 years with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 years old in a study of 8,866 cases mentioned above.
Patients who require thorough treatment are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who do not (at median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Genital: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as stated above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require thorough treatment are more likely to experience acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiovascular problems are also a cause of death in SARS patients.

Abnormal laboratory findings: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been suggested as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy and final cure.
Relation of CRP levels to severity and COVID-19 prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.

Clinical key symptoms: Chest radiography and clinical symptom progression over time should be considered alongside other issues to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs commonly used as adjunct therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Considering that high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients suffered from extreme stress as they often faced long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessed the deaths of close family members and friends of patients.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.

Apart from doubling in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can double efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common cold.

Although the measures have significantly damaged the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases has declined, marking the end of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates are that the epidemic will end at the end of March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the central turbinate swab and the throat of patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a recurrent influenza-like episode.

Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.

As with SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes weaker and eventually ends up or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.

A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be due to nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 healthcare workers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of seizures is by wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected individuals from spreading through ventilation or adhering to the surface of the material, which can then spread to others.
None of the two types of virus is known to penetrate the N95 mask. However, only N95 type masks (series #1860s) can protect against small virion inhalation of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion penetrating the N95 type mask; SARS-CoV-2 is almost identical to SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are about 85 nm in size.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In addition to face masks, health workers must wear protective equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also infect individuals through the eyes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Healthcare workers should also wear a protective face mask or safety glasses when dealing with patients.
For the public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is advised that all residents wash their hands with disinfectant soap frequently, stay at home and reduce contact with potentially infected individuals.

The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that started in late December 2019.

As the virus is almost identical to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also almost identical to SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created the sentiment that the SARS outbreak has recurred.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
COVID-19 affects older individuals than younger individuals and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are higher among older people than among adolescents.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in sick conditions, which results in difficulty in curbing COVID-19 transmission compared to SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.

Although 96% of genetic homologs have been found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as bats SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 also originated in bats.
Are animals the intermediate species that transmit the virus from the household, for example, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively determine transmission, and epidemics can recur at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how can the virus actually enter airway cells and subsequently cause pathological changes?

HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs come from non-pathogenic bats.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for human disease prevention.

In this study, we presented an overview of the existing knowledge related to seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The epidemic of COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful hos exchange and implications for the evolution of the virus against the severity of the disease were also emphasized.
The coronavirus (CoV) is from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a single, positively impaired, enveloped RNA virus group.
The length of this genome is between 26 and 32 kilobases and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share the same layout.

Based on the protein sequence differences, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-Cov genera comprise most HCoVs and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Filogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rats act as the gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-coVs.
Over the course of thousands of years, CoV has outpaced the resistance of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The other five beta-CoVs are included in HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with moderate symptoms, such as flu and/or diarrhea.

Different alveolar damage, epithelial cell growth and increase in macrophage were also observed in SARS patients.

In addition to infections in the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storm, which can cause death especially in immunocompromised patients.
Virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative to an index patient travelling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.

Generally speaking, when HCoVs acquire the ability to spread efficiently and to persist in the human body, the virus also becomes less harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have these symptoms.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly escalate to acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide target homology of 82%, the virus clusters into different branches on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid spread worldwide.

First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms was between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (cth. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).

In other words, both of them may have survived the previous HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that have severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
To allow this to happen, HCoVs must multiply in humans to a sufficient level to allow for the accumulation of matching mutations that fight host restriction factors.
The longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.

Virus must remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoir and seek opportunities to spread to susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate hosts and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-infected HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The virus is more pathogenic than community-infected HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Time will determine whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and spread among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.

An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close hereditary group that shares a high homology at the nucleotide target level.
The hereditary viruses usually adapt well and are not pathogenic in these hosts.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In both cases, the host is usually naturally infected and is the natural host for HCoV or its virion.
Conversely, if a new HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to the new and usually pathogenic host.
The intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as a breeding host by allowing the virus to temporarily multiply and then spread the virus to humans to strengthen the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become deadly if they cannot maintain their infectiveness in intermediate hosts.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create long-term infectiousness.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal in a restrospective manner that SARS index cases have a history of contact with game animals.

WIV1 obtained from a sample of bat feces has been shown to use bats, mosquitoes and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.

WIV1 represents the closest lineage to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide orientation homology.
Although there is a high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV.
Filogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, diluted peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in the beta-CoV of bats identified from Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and the closest family CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the homology of nucleotide targeting.

Conversely, studies in the Middle East show that the Arab camel has a positive effect on the specific MERS-CoV neutralization antibodies, similar to camels in the Middle East that come from various African countries.
MERS-CoV live-like viruses found in humans have been isolated through the nasal swab of the Arab camel, further indicating that camels serve as pure MERS-CoV reservoir hosts.

In particular, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the mouthways, which are also the pathways for the virus to be released from bats.
The question remains, however, since many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before symptoms begin, possibly linked to human-to-human transmission pathways or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homologue with the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the deviation of focus between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine a maternal relationship.

A number of recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small, endangered mammals known as the hornet (Manis javanica) may also store the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The genome of this co-living coal mill shares 85-92% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.

They are grouped into two subdescendants of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in pilogenetic trees, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RDB) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In apparent differences, RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more distorted, despite having a higher degree of genome-wide homology.
Previous studies of infected mosquitoes also reported detection of viral conjunctivitis from lung samples, which were later found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a method of assembling and selecting a manual sequence to generate a partial genome sequence that comprises about 86.3% of the full virus genome.

The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, crustaceans and other mammals remains to be determined.
While the highest homology sequence has been found in RBD between SARS-COV-2 and the strain, beta-CoV is related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the highest genome-wide homology.
Strong speculation suggests that high-level similarities between RBDs from beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 strain and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by selective focused evolution.
One response suggests in favor of a recombination between beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2 ganglion and RaTG13 in a third wildlife species.
As a driving force of evolution, re-inserting occurs widely in beta-CoV.

In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Filogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoV bats, while virons HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 have been found in mice.

HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while camelid has also been suspected as an intermediate host.
For more details, current knowledge of animal origin for known HCoVs is formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Filogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the occurrence of HCoV transmission between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.

Among them is alpha-CoV alpaca.

First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Conversely, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, the alpaca alpacaCoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non-pathogenic in the alpaca, whereas the alpaca alpacaCoV causes respiratory disease in the animals expected
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca has not been found in wildlife.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas get HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
The fact is that bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies, Ebola, Nipah and Hendra viruses.

Alternatively, although the bat alpha-CoV is the root of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and camels may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of species-to-species transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
MERS-CoVs were first identified in the early stages of the disease and have been confirmed by subsequent discoveries.

Longevity, dense cramp colonies, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all conditions that encourage bats to be ideal 'viral transmitters'.

It adapts well to these camels who have switched from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.

Different from camel function in the spread of MERS-CoV, the function of the caterpillar, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV of the jawbone is highly pathogenic in the jawbone.
They may be the end hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, similar to the fox in SARS-CoV cases.
Several possibilities for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be accepted or rejected in future studies.

A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
As mentioned above, re-synthesis and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that had contact with both bats and squirrels.

In addition to the different types of hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating the CoV to cross species barriers.
First, their mutation rates are relatively high in RNA duplication.
Compared to single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated CoV mutation rate can be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average exchange rate of ~10-4 exchanges per year per 2 sites, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to the novel host.
CoV has a prof reading exoribonucleus, its extinguishing causes extremely high susceptibility and weakness or possibly even lack of vitality.
Interestingly, Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV multiplication through this exoribonuclease sequencing and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.


Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high degree of adaptation to humans.

Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic mutations will render vaccines and antiviruses against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses additional plasticity in genomic changes for mutation and reassembly, while increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.

Third, CoVs change templates randomly and frequently during RNA duplication through a unique "sort-to-select" mechanism.
In hoses that function as mixing vessels, a fluid exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous, full-genome RNAs can be reconstituted to produce new CoVs.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural combination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interactions with host receptors are another major factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV reintegration is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of human and mouse SARS-CoV sequencing, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD on S protein.

In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid at the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as the common receptor for virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, foxes, rats and raccoon dogs, allowing the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 remaining amino acids are observed to differ from human and mouse viral compression in RBD and 4 of them are located within the receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the association of spike protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be essential for the virus's adaptation to humans.

30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV within the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the binding relationship of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM research shows a linkage of this bond that is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors may be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

There are many other HCoV receptors in existence, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and acetylated sialic acid 9-O for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its host.
In addition to cellular receptors, the effects of interspecies transmission of HCoV also depend on host dependence and other barrier factors.
The difference in this host protein between humans and HCoVs in natural reservoir hosts such as bats, camels and rodents may create barriers to transmission between species.
HCoVs need to capture host dependence factors and subvert host restriction factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the critical areas of interaction of these viruses-hoses have not yet been identified and characterized.

The emergence of novel HCoVs: back to the beginning
The diversity of bats' CoVs provides a wide opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this respect, the bat CoV acts as a pool of HCoV genes.

For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein coding genes has the potential to drastically alter the phenotype of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated but have been found to encode the inhibitory ORF8 protein.
The extinction characteristic of nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the beginning of human epidemics.
The extinguishments separate ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and are considered to be adaptation mutations that promote host exchange.

The re-combination location is also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and part of nsp14.

In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, which have seen HCoVs reintegrate with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.

While ORF4 strength can be seen in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca displays a single nucleotide insertion, which results in skeletal dislocation.
Eventually, the evolution of novel HCoVs was also driven by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Only asymptomatic or mild symptoms have been detected when bats are infected with CoV, signaling a co-adjustment between CoV and bats.

In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been disproportionate from the CoV multiplication.
The same strategies that respond to the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type 1 interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.

For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory sequencing with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoVs of bats that share 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also CoVs of bats that share 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although foxes and other animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.

The study of CoV in bats and other animals has drastically changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
For the same reason, the squirrel must be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple squirrel beta-CoV descendants closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

To prevent the re-transmission of MERS epidemic, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, new genotypes may be emerging to cause the epidemic.
Varieties of CoVs are widespread in the forest.
In particular, the CoV of bats with zoonotic potential is highly diverse.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and reintegrate, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily contagious and/or can kill in humans in the future.
The culture of wild animal feeding in some parts of China must be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans must be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
The virus remains in the natural reservoir until there is a chance of infection.
Although bats have many characteristics that facilitate the spread of the virus, the chances of humans having contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if communities are educated to avoid the animals.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
Conclusion The most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is by keeping humans away from the natural ecological reservoir for zoonotic viruses.

Second, if bats play a more pivotal role in transmitting to humans, we need to determine how humans get in contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and crustaceans needs to be explained.
Finally, given that many mammals including exotic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and infection experimentally should be conducted.
Whether it is bats, snails or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar parent virus will be identified in the natural host in the future.
Continued research in this area will explain the evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.

We recognize their important efforts and thank you.
However, their efforts also require updates in accordance with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition of trials) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires the combination of any one item of epidemiological historical characteristics with two items of clinical manifestation to produce a comprehensive analysis, or must meet three items of clinical manifestation if no clear epidemiological history is present:
Epidemiological history: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days of onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 case infection (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported within 14 days of onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed case clusters ((> 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occur within 2 weeks in small areas, such as homes, offices, classrooms at school, etc.).

Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery", and labelled the demand as "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales rose in "abrupt increases" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock for the Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to add stock but local council restrictions on truck deliveries made it difficult.
He expects product costs to rise, when suppliers try to meet demand, and little special.

In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill up stocks every night.
He told me that the toilet paper was a big deal, leading to a low quantity on the stock, and, when it sold out, leaving the vast empty shelf space, reinforcing the sense of want.
Coles and Woolworths have the view that if there are a lot of things on the shelves, if products like toiletries and toiletries are available and have quantity, you'll probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap Wednesday They ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent, insist that they work 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toiletries to first bidders at a auction session in Melbourne, when a small auction was held due to buyers facing a holiday during the long Labor Day holiday.
Thursday edition of the NT News, a daily printing in Darwin, included eight additional pages of paper intended to be cut and used as toilet cloth.

We're very concerned about both the level of transmission and the level of severity of the concern and the level of non-action of the concern.
Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the pandemic "has never happened before".
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from emergence to ongoing worldwide transmission".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a coronavirus-induced pandemic before".
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the pandemic an international public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "in short, things are going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Public Health Emergency at International Level on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing approximately 97,000 deaths.

There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population must be infected before effective group immunity can be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those who only have mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source for 79% of recorded cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March estimates that the number of infections in Italy is higher than the reported cases.

The numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate for cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed dying from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which describes the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from the disease.

A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate for this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies that analyze the impact of the test on the CFR estimate.
WHO affirms that the pandemic is controllable.
The peak and peak periods of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University observed, "Leaved unchecked, the infectious outbreak usually slows down and then starts to deteriorate when the disease runs out of available shelter.
"But it's almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions right now about when that's going to happen".

On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread, perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical training and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that the coronavirus is so contagious that it's gone completely" and it "may be a seasonal disease, coming back every year".
The damage to the reappearance will depend on the group's immunity and the level of mutation.

The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unprotected coughs cause ai drops to move up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).

There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.

Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus clusters genetically with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (descendants B) together with two bat-derived fungi.
The virus is 96% similar at full genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).

The total genome variation so far has found that at most 92% of genetic material is shared between the coronavirus ganglion and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove ganglion as an intermediate host.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although verification is ultimately through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first being released on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).

As of 6 April 2020, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The imaging features on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) for symptomatic oang include asymmetrical lateral glazed soil and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Association is assembling an online database of interviews to find imaging for confirmed cases.
As a result of resistance to other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-verified imaging has limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although imaging was less specific to infection, the method was faster and more sensitive, suggesting considering the method as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
A circular neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect viral imaging with both X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies for preventing the spread of disease include maintaining good overall self-hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on tissue and then putting the tissue straight into a garbage can.

CDC recommends that the public wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the detonator for stainless steel surfaces), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate croxidin, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility such as an office or day care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people, should be decommissioned.
The health organization recommends that people close their mouths and noses with bent arms or tissue during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance travelled by the dispersed breathing drops during speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene care".Masks have also been recommended for use by those caring for someone who may have the disease.
WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.

Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or suggested self-quarantine to all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in the high-risk group.

The strategy in control of the epidemic is to contain or suppress, and to reduce.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected and introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are then shifted to the planning stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and society.

The pressure requires more drastic measures to slow down the pandemic by reducing the number of basic breeding to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of health services becoming overburdened and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage transmission include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-targeted physical confinement measures such as closing schools and cancelling mass rally events; community involvement to encourage admission and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.

South Korea introduced massive screening and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who self-quarantine and imposes high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined the emphasis on medical supplies.Simulation for Great Britain and the United States showed that reduction (slowing down but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) posed major challenges.
Optimal reduction policies may reduce peak health care demands to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system becomes overwhelmed.
Action can be optional but should be maintained as long as the virus spreads in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that comes first), as the spread will quickly bounce back when prevention measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.

COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The National Health Agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely linked to a gathering in Daegu from a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji followers who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the source of the infection.

All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed that three military personnel tested positive for the virus.
South Korea introduced what is considered the world's most widespread and well-organized program to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected individuals and track and quarantine people who come into contact with them.
Filtering methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile apps, past viral testing with results available the next day, and improved testing capabilities that allow up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's programme was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Most Koreans signed a petition either demanding Moon's dismissal over what they accused of being government mismanagement of the epidemic, or praising his response.

WHO has praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and controlling the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when the Chinese government was accused of secrecy to the point of undermining prevention and control efforts, and the current crisis that saw the central government "provide regular updates to avoid panic before the Chinese New Year holiday".

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC is the result of "a global risk of transmission especially to low- and middle-income countries without a robust health system.
In response to the passage of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that needlessly suspend international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tedros went on to make a statement declaring that "we are the strongest of our weakest chains" and urging the international community to "invest today or pay later". On February 11, WHO in a press conference designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
The same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to give "the entire UN system power in response".
As a result, a UN Crisis Management team has been activated, enabling the overall coordination of the UN response, which WHO says will allow them to "focus on health responses while other agencies can bring their expertise to bear the broader adverse social, economic and development impacts of the pandemic".

In response to the ongoing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "highest" to "highest", the highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergency health program, warned in his statement that "This is a reality check for every government on the planet: Wake up.

Ryan further stated that current data do not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, as a declaration means "we basically accept that all humans on this planet will be exposed to the virus".

Director-General WHO said that "the WHO is deeply concerned by both the levels of contagion and the levels of severity of concern, and the levels of inactivity of concern". WHO has faced significant criticism for what it sees as unfair pandemic control, including delayed health declarations as a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The Daily Beast acquired a U.S. government channel that outlined communications fraud with clear origins in the National Security Council, with the strategy being referred to as "Everything is about China.
We are advised to try and ensure that this message is revealed in any way, including media conferences and television appearances."Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda effort to influence the world.

By mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their workers to a government-subsidized short-term employee scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
Short-term work compensation schemes were implemented by France and Britain.

Organizations of the arts and culture sector attempt to enhance their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the community, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 202, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, event and performance events have been cancelled and postponed indefinitely.
In response, there have been intensive measures to provide alternative services via digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly sinking drop from the pandemic has been the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology seminars, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Sunday in Rome, which took place during the last week of Lent of the Christian penitential season, had been canceled.
Many bishops have suggested that older Christians sit at home rather than attend Church Services on Sundays; some churches have held church services via radio, live streams online or television while others offer guided worship.
With the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome closing down the small churches and churches and the plains of St. Peter being emptied from the Christian congregation, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and pantheons.

The pandemic has caused a very significant disruption to the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 201920 UEFA Champions League, 201920 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 201920 NBA season and 201920 NHL season.
The outbreak affected plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not beyond summer 2021". Casinos and gambling locations around the world have been closed as well as live poker matches have either been postponed or canceled.
This has led many gambling leg to switch to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration rates.The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling touring concerts.
Many theatres such as Broadway have suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing works via the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their work.

Tests are used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody testing shows the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or asymptomatic.
The exact disease-related mortality rate and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
As a result of limited testing, as of March 2020 no country has data that can be expected on virus prevalence in their population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a great diversity in the number of tests that were done across countries.

Using reverse polymerase chain reaction transcription (rRT-PCR) real-time testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests with a throat swab are only reliable in the first week of disease.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For those infected tested in the second dose, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airway or injected catheter or sputum causing material can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse polymerase response transcription (rRT-PCR), and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed a test by January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kid, a clinical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the RT-PCR 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the older version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results due to a damaged reagent, and a bottleneck test at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Testing using two components cannot be guaranteed to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and prior to that state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.

On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since these tests do not require a series of temperature cycles, this method can give a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.

In March 2020 a written review concluded that "breast radiographs have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the discovery of CT [computed tomography] may have been present even before symptoms began".
Typical features of CT include a multilobar glass surface with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior dispersion.
Subpleural dominance, mad opening and fusion are formed as disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the current pandemic origin point has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many of its imaging features acting on the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.

High-voltage automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this assessment but availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although a single specimen of the serum can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCTs a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by injection into the skin.
Unlike PCR, pre-assessment scheduling measures are not required. As of March 26, 2020, the FDA has named 29 entities that provide the agency with information as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Test capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection begins.In early April, the UK found no antibody test kit was purchased that was good enough to use.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme that sees suspected patients staying at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a specimen tube", they spit into the tube, send it back and get test results shortly afterwards. NHS British has announced that it is pioneering a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of patients infecting others if they go to hospital or need to sanction an ambulance if used. In a driving test for COVID-19 for suspected cases, a healthcare worker takes a sample using appropriate precautionary measures.
The guidance centre has helped South Korea to conduct some of the fastest, most comprehensive tests in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Professionals said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
Health insurance covers expenses when a medical examination is required.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.

Wuhan Laboratory was immediately followed by Hou Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020 the total daily total is 50,000 tests per day.Open source, multiplex designs issued by Origami Assays have been released that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using just 93 ratings.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient amount of reagents had made it difficult for large-scale testing in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE was testing more of its citizens for Coronavirus per capita than any other country, and was on track to increase the scale of testing levels to reach the majority of the population.

Testing capacity, mostly in private sector labs, built in a few years by the South Korean government.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had a "weakness"; the government later issued bureaucratic restrictions that had prevented private testing. The Spanish nation purchased the test kit from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the decision incorrect.
The firm explains that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or use the kit properly.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the kit be thrown into the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kit purchased by Turkey from China had a "high sense of guilt" and did not "use it".
Testing, followed by quarantining those who tested positive and detecting those in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of testing across a population of nearly 3,400 people, over a ten-day period.
Nearly half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.

With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved more slowly than other developing countries, but without any strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to stay home on March 28, but schools will reopen in time after a break on March 23.

WHO recommends that countries that do not have the testing capacity and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send the first five positive samples and the ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for verification testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "Positive as % test" is influenced by national test policy.

Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hands with the aim of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap at a certain "critical time" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and mumps, that spread through the mouth through the mouth.
Individuals may also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (cth., mucous membrane).
The five critical times during the day that witness hand washing with soap are important: before and after flushing, after cleaning a child's back or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.

After changing the diapers or cleaning the kids who used the bathroom.


Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before handling medicines or taking medicines can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.

A 2013 study showed that well-integrated handwashing practices would lead to a small increase in the high growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the childhood mortality rate associated with respiratory illnesses and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.

Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program.
Washing hands can also protect against impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
The minor side effect of washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage from dryness on the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, scaly skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Pretty often washing hands is also seen as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the infection to the mouth: after using the toilet (washing, pickling), after cleaning the back of the child (changing diapers), before bribing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal filth or handling animals; and after handling garbage.

The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are organic soil components, are insoluble in water.

Due to its reusable properties, soap soap may store bacteria acquired from previous use.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated soap have found that transfer is unlikely to occur because bacteria are discarded when washed with foam.
CDC website still states "liquid soap that is removed without hand use is better".
Antibacterial soap gets a high promotion from people who care about health.
There is no evidence so far that using antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended to select antibiotic-resistant organisms.
Antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a broad list of resistance to organism strains.
So even if antibody resistant strains aren't selected by antibacterial soap, they might not be as effective as they're marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, these advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin remedies (aloe vera, vitamins, peppers, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the Faculty of Public Health at the University of Oregon shows that ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Water is not too hot to wash hands It's not hot enough to kill bacteria
The bacteria reproduce more rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that using hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial content of the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rubbing was becoming popular as a non-water-based hand sanitizer agent (also known as alcohol-based rubbing, antiseptic hand rubbing, or hand sanitizer).
Most are based on isopropyl alcohols or ethanol formulated with thickening agents such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymers) into gels, or humektanes such as glycerin into liquids, or foams for ease of use and to reduce the drying effects of alcohol.

Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.

The effects of alcohol on the body can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolens to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused a significant reduction in skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial detergent.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or other substances in alcoholic hand rubbing is rare.

Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
There is concern if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase rather than reduce the spread of disease.
Ash is also a disinfectant agent like soap because it forms an alkali solution if it comes into contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is unavailable.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of disease which include the following measures:
hands wet with running water hot or cold.

In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, compared the level of hygiene when using paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria found in the lower extremities increased on average by 194% and in the palms by 254%.
Drying with jet air dryers causes an increase in the number of bacteria on the lower extremities of the finger on average by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the tip is thus reduced on average by up to 76% and at the palm of the hand up to 77%.
Jet air dryers, which blow air out of the unit at a charge of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 bsj), are capable of blowing out microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment by up to 2 metres.

There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels for drying.
Washing hands using hand sanitizer is an alternative when traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands for medical purposes was long an obligation when Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis of Hungary discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing illness in hospital settings.
There's an electronic device that warns hospital staff to wash their hands when they're forgotten.

Wash your hands medically for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to soften and rub each hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with the fingers that are inserted intently.
If there is dirt under the nails, a fur brush can be used to dispose of it.

Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application of occupational health and safety methodology for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard control depends on the workplace and work tasks, based on risk assessment for exposure sources, severity of illness in the community, and risk factors for each employee who may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal workplace contact with civilians and other colleagues, where basic infection prevention measures are proposed including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and maintaining routine hygiene and disinfection in the workplace.
Occupations with moderate exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to an ongoing community outbreak or international travel.
Included are workers who have contact with the public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and some retail environments with high volume.
Risk management for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing guards, and having self-protective equipment in case of encounter with COVID-19 infected people.
OSHA considers health care and mortuary workers exposed to people known or suspected of having COVID-19 to have a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if the employee performs aerosol manufacturing procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from people known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.

The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects in the workplace.

The prevalence of disease in the community where the business is located affects the response taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Engineering control involves isolating workers from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in labour policy or procedure that requires action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control but may help prevent some exposure.
All PPE types must be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed according to suitability (cth respirator), properly worn consistently, constantly inspected, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure jobs have minimal employment contact with civilians and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics including closing when coughing and sneezing, providing towels and garbage cans, preparing for telework or shift work if necessary, not encouraging employees to use other people's tools or equipment, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Identification and early isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respiratory symptoms stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing medication or other symptom-modifying medication, and a flexible sick leave policy, allowing workers to stay home to care for sick family members, and employees to know about this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community outbreaks occurring around a business location, or because the individual has recently travelled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 outbreaks.
Included are workers with contact with the public such as in schools, work environments with high population density and some high volume retail environments. Engineering controls for these groups and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneezing protectors and installing passing driver windows for customer service. Administrative controls for these groups and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to sit at home, replacing face-to-face desktops with virtual work communication, creating a phased shift of equipment, stopping unnecessary travel to locations with the COVID-19 outbreak occurring, developing emergency communication including education forums to respond to concerns, providing employees with training and updates on risk factors and behavioral tasks, training employees to use protective clothing and protective equipment and providing a environment that encourages personal protective equipment, including hand-to-hand or face protection, and at least some measures to protect the public face and face, including COVID-19 exposure, and providing employees with training and training on how to use protective clothing and protective equipment and how to use personal protective equipment, providing a means of protective hand and protective equipment that encourages the use of hand, or at least some measures to protect the use of hand and protective equipment that customers may be used to protect their hands, or use face masks, and face mask, and face mask, etc.
Workers in this risk group rarely require respirators.
If someone falls ill on a plane, proper controls to protect the staff and other passengers include isolating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to care for the sick person, and giving the sick a face mask or having the sick person cover their mouths and noses with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick travelers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may have additional self-protective equipment if sick travelers experience fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazardous bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel when ill, isolation and informing the on-board medical center immediately if someone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Preferably, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantine person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the community's spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community spread, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and choir classes or eating in cafeterias, increasing the space between tables, incremental arrival and return times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with symptoms such as flu.
When there is a high prevalence in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures may be considered.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
If close contact occurs during capture, workers should clean and detox their belt and work equipment before reusing with a household spray or cleaning pad, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of the PPE used and for placing and washing clothes.
OSHA considers health care workers and mortuary workers to be in a high or very high category for exposure risk.
High-risk exposed jobs include delivery of healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

Aerosol manufacturing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimens collection.
High-risk mortuary work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of their death; it is extremely high exposure risk if they perform autopsies.
Aerial ventilation with a specific negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care facilities and mortuaries.

WHO recommends only surgical masks for entry inspection staff.
WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protection, or facials, protective clothing and gloves for those who collect, treat, or transport respiratory specimens from, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol manufacturing procedure.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
As global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE via telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter COVID-19 patient rooms, using only PPE needed for specific tasks, continuing the same respirator use without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for symptomatic individuals.

Alignment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next day and month.
In that discussion, we assumed what we thought would be the response to what we were facing and the best way to ensure that this organization survived the present moment.
Together, we want to relieve stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to slow down a little, that's fine.
To all staff, contractors and contracted workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't announce leave - if you can work on normal hours, the mission can use you.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

What we do can be so satisfying, especially in times like these.
Once again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager so we can know what to expect and adjust it accordingly.

There are some things we must keep going.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional assistance.
We're going to start a process with all departments to assess our current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what's important to our mission.
There's so much to do for all of us, we're just gonna focus on the most important projects.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
️We don't plan to go "double-in to catch up" once the pandemic is over.

We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will endeavour to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What happened to the APP?
To adjust to the real realities and expectations of our daily working hours, we would like to align our 2020-2021 Annual Plan delivery timeline.
Our intention is to recommend a 2019-2020 extension plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for their loved ones while helping those who need or want to work with reduced working hours for the next few weeks.
Duration of timelines greatly reduces workload and current planning stress throughout the organization.
We will present our recommendations to the Board next week and will inform the representatives and teams of the next steps once we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this matter.

Now, please-- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and others on the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 is subject to activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (---) making it an expected targeted drug for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry center into cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc containing a metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endotelium and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the renal amino acid transporter domain of C-terminal colectin.
ACE2 is a single-way membrane protein of type 1, with its active enzyme domain expressed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is attached to the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually collected into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is expressed in the cell membranes of most alveolus type II lung cells, small intestinal entrocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial soft muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.

ACE binds the hormone angiotensin I to the narrowing of the angiotensin II vessel.
ACE2 on the other hand attaches phenylalanine to the carboxylic-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also bind to a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the distribution of the SLC6A19 amino acid-neutral transporter membrane and has been shown in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point into cells for some coronavirus including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causing virus).
In particular, binding to the S1 peptic protein for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the enzyme domain on the ACE2 of the cell surface results in endosytosis and translocation of the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located between cells.
The insertion process also requires the enrichment of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serine prosthesis, a marker under current study as a potential therapeutic.

A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% significant decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
"The risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who are at higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.

Human ACE2 (rhACE2) recombination is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute lipopolysaccharide respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour action (tempoh).
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a drug to be expected for those with intolerance to classical renin angiotensin system boosters (RAS boosters) or in diseases surrounding angiotensin II enhanced.

Phase I-II trials perform initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, controlled and multi-site placebo, while determining the effective dose more accurately.
Stage III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of testing on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidates for vaccines in active development (separated as of early April 2020), 74 are still undergoing human evaluation and are still in "preclinical" research.

Early research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific animal models of COVID-19 such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for tier 3 bio-security restrictive measures to control live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
As MERS spreads widely, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media coverage promotes conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 is known and a vaccine is already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic referencing and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.

Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus is particularly prevalent among humans during close contact, often through tiny droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced during inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface rather than becoming contagious for long distances.

Inkumbiacy period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in transmission is still not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of disease.

The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Talking loudly gives off more drops than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that does not close its mouth can cause a drop moving up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although viruses are not inherently so, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that possible bioaerosol transfer and air-gathering in positions in hallways outside public rooms indicate positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion to become aerosol and subsequently cause innate spread.
Although there is concern that it spreads through the stool, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when people are asymptomatic; although spread is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects two to three people in general.
In particular, viruses were found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.

Sapone and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products weaken the protective layer of viral fat, suck it up and free it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine (surgical disinfectant) were less effective.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.

The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 as the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), the most abundant in type II alveolus cells in the lungs.
Virus uses a special surface of glycoprotein called "pepaku" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter host cells.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of those infected who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China and more often in severe illnesses.
High rates of cardiovascular symptoms, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disease during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2 expression epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-expressing T cells have been shown to correlate with the intake of inflammatory monocyte expressing IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic breakdowns were also reported during the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on breathing samples obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs; however, a nasal swab or a salivary sample may also be used.
The decision is generally available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the decision has little immediate value.

Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the shoulder when no tissue is present.
Proper hand washing after any cough or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face masks in public places, in part to limit movement by asymptomatic individuals. Social confinement strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups through the closure of schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The guidelines for incarceration also include for people to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.

In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other important affected organs.
CDC recommends that anyone suspecting they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.

Conservative measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Infectious Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and in-person precautions.
Recommended equipment are: PPE dresses, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved by industry regulations but the FDA has already approved the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

Type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospital patients with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-resistance nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two provide the same benefits to critically ill people is unknown.
Some doctors choose to remain with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canulae.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle the sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that require hospital admission.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

High PEEP may not be available on the ventilator for longer.
Research for a potential treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to develop, some drugs under test have already been approved for other uses and are already undergoing further testing.
Antivirus medicines may be tested on people who have a serious illness.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in potential efficacy and safety trials of treatment. FDA grants temporary approval for recovery plasma as an experimental treatment in cases for their serious or life-threatening.

Individuals may experience stress as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic downturns are the perfect thousand that endanger people's mental health and well-being".
The disease will cause mild effects with little or no symptoms, similar to a common upper respiratory illness such as a common cold.

In most severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly degenerate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal freezing and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal freezing, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, has been observed in as many as 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function was observed in 4% of this group.

The same report estimates that the median time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days left for hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median time of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In early case studies, the median time from initial symptom identification to death was 14 days, with full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, males had a mortality rate of 2.8% while females had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of a post-mortem lung sample showed diffuse alveolus damage with exudated cellular fibromisoids in both lungs.
Virus cytopathy changes are observed in the pneumocytes.

In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed with increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospital with existing health conditions, the availability of medical resources and the region's socioeconomic might also affect mortality rates.
The estimates of the mortality rate from the conditions differed because of their regional differences, but also because of the methodological difficulties.
A low count of mild cases can cause overestimates for mortality rates.
The fact that deaths are caused by past infections can mean that the current mortality rate is overestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are at least 2.4 times more likely to require proper care or die than non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This can also lead to post-rehabilitation syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behaviours, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for coronavirus on a previously reported date.

Virus are considered natural and derived from animals, through the infection of the spleen.
The exact origin is unknown but as of December 2019 the total transmission of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.

The number varies by region. Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
Statistics are not time-bound and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.

69 (0.004% of the population) confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates differ for men and women.
The mortality rate was higher for men in the study was conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women only closing at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviations CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for time of epidemic were identified for the first time: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to a particular geographic location (cth. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international naming regulations aimed at avoiding stigma.
WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19") in public communication.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the early spread in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV as temporary names for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guidelines on the use of location for disease and virus names.
