Butler once again praised the young warrior, Tyler-hero who is responsible for the future of hits, "the way of thinking is not rookie".
Heat screaming (practice match) The first game was against the Kings.
In this game, which was a quick 104-98 win, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points for Team High, Tyler Hero followed that up with 15 points and a backcourt performance.
Robinson, the league's top-ranked shooter, of course, will be a key factor in the heats as the rookie, hero, and stepping-up of the entire draft's 13 nominees.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to a leg injury, and the last game of the March 12 comeback against the Hornets, which ended the season with a long hiatus.
The hero says that "it was time enough to get back to 100% condition, the best feeling I ever had", but that the performance in the scream was more convincing than words.
The delay in the merger of the forward point guard Kendrick Nunn has increased the hero's playtime, and the way he has lived up to that opportunity.
The 15 points on a different role and a great performance are valuable.
Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the hero of his favorite series once again.
"He can handle, score, defend, he can do anything for the team, he can play any position, because the thinking is not rookie's, he is watching videos, researching, and hitting his head on where his teammates move and how they become free, and what he should do about it".
Since the season opener, Butler has been enjoying the hero's rookie-like, unwavering strength and stingy attitude toward basketball.
That's why I've been inviting you to practice, starting at 4 a.m. and training together.
Butler once said that "he does not give his opinion to anyone, he does not withdraw; such a struggle is respectable".
The butler is always the type to say what he thinks is right for the team, and he will face tough opinions knowing that a conflict will occur.
This has also led to deteriorating relationships with teammates in the past.
Butler is probably overshadowing himself as a hero.
The character of the batter, sometimes too harsh for a teammate, can be a good guide for those with enough guts to come up with.
If the relationship between two students who respect each other spreads to the whole team, the Heat should become a team that can even go higher.

It may not be as compassionate as it is, but it is proof of a serious struggle.
Matsunpu is convinced that "from now on the level of the opposing bettor will rise; I will come to the end with the intention of taking the runner home".
Saitō, who threw six shots, did not step even two in a good throw, but he kept his three-year goal to a close.
The number 10 is a well-intentioned take on the idea that "two years of going out will stimulate three more years, if it leads to victory".
The team that is aiming to finish fourth for the third consecutive year in the Shikoku Conference up to last year will not be able to remember the rest of the games.
The world of singing with the people of the prefecture is full of 16 musicians from the prefecture of Fukushima.
I want to bring the lively vocals of the Hamama-Matsu-ji-Zin to the world.
Sixteen musicians from the various districts of Fukushima Prefecture have come together and created a message song.
The lyrics are written in the direction of the recovery from the devastating earthquake in East Japan and the Tokyo Electric Fukushima I nuclear accident, and the ferocious appearance of Fukushima Prefecture fighting a new type of coronavirus.
The prefectural people will be singing, and the "full version" will be finished by next summer, the tenth anniversary of the earthquake.

The positive attitude of the people is to "report from Fukushima" in a bright and lively melody.

When the project began in March of the coronavirus pandemic, singer-songwriters from Fukushima City, MANAMI, and 野潤, respectively, were in succession to congratulate and the circle spread in an instant.
"I've become a fancy face that you wouldn't think of in normal times. I want to take advantage of this opportunity".
As a precaution against infection, 16 people were not allowed to gather, each recorded live in a house or home.
In an effort to push the project forward, the city's painter, Jayav, drew an image of the character.

Two new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Sendai City (TBC East North Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
In Sendai, a new man in his 50s and 60s was found to be infected with the new coronavirus.
The infection was confirmed in men in their 50s and 60s who were both businessmen living in Sendai.
According to Sendai City, the men in their 60s were close contacts of female contractors in their 20s who were confirmed infected on 23rd of this month and were working for the same company.

The Internet information instantly detects a crisis and determines dementia.
"I want to know as soon as possible where what kind of disaster or accident happened!"
This is not only needed by media outlets such as TV and newspapers, but also by many social infrastructure companies and municipalities.
The service to answer this is Spectee's Spectrum, which is AI-powered information analytics.
 Photos Alert from the Spectre to a team of experts to determine the authenticity of social media information
The first means for people to know about disasters and accidents is now beginning to shift from television to online information, social media.
Social media such as Twitter has become an important means of communicating information immediately after disasters or accidents occur.
It's just that keeping an eye on the information that's coming out and extracting useful information from it is hard for humans.
Specetti has the ability to detect and analyze natural disasters and accidents from social media streams such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other sources of information, and then use it to distribute to businesses to determine the truth of the information.
"The broadly positioning of events with a negative impact that will stop/stagnate social activity as a 'crisis' (Murae Jianji's representative CEO) is a crisis management support service that visualizes the various crises that are occurring at home and abroad".
The NHK, which was the first major use case of the spectrum during the Kumbon earthquake in April 2016, has since spread rapidly among businesses.
It is said that more than 350 national companies, including not only television stations and news agencies, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local authorities across the country, are now using Spectrum.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of "crisis".
Specetti distributes information through four steps: "gathering information", "analysis and classification of content", "titling", and "false determination".
Companies using the information must specify in advance the areas where the information is collected (e.g. metropolitan areas, city districts, towns, etc.), the categories of crisis (e.g. disasters and accidents).
Specetti collects posts that fall under its designation using the API provided by social media.
Then, they analyze and classify the text, images, and videos in the collected posts.
For example, if a video shows a fire truck, black smoke rising from a building, or an orange flame coming from a room, it is classified as "fire".
Also, if images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents" or if images of roads covered in water, they are classified as "road wreckage".
Specetti also makes estimates of the location of disasters and accidents.
"I often don't know where from the post, so I guess by combining different information", says the CEO of the village.
For example, if images or videos display road signs or signs, extract geographic information from them, compare them with a database of geographic names and identify the location.
Angel, the opening game was a loss to Sayonaura... Grand Valley was 1 of 5, 9 times full of 3 balls and 3 shots.
○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <local time July 24th, Oakland-Colossum> Angels' great-great-grandfather shining on the field of play.
Although he first pitched in the starting lineup this season, the next four starts were all-time wins, 5 sacks and 1 triple-double.
The Grand Valley has fought Montana three times, once and for all.
Five third-place games, in which he played 1-1 against second-half right-hander Petit, also ended in a draw.
In eight fourth-place games, which he led 2-1 and 1-point, he faced fifth-left-arm Dickman as a starter.
The two balls returned to the opposite direction at a straight-line angle, but fell to the left of the shot rather than fence over.
Angel's eight laps of the 1-point lead, the rescue right-arm battery, which lost two points, allowed for a reversal, the nine laps left, the newly added catcher, No. 7, Castro, who is the team's No. 1 this season, to the right-wing seat.
They followed up with a 3-3 mark on the ground.
Then, two deaths one, two deaths and the order of the order of the numbers is two-thirds.
The Athletics bench here declares the trout outright, and has chosen the Big Valley match with two deadly losses.
The great valley was expected to be won and overrun, but the athletics were bowled out for 3 goals and 3 shots ahead of the athletics' guardian god Hendrix.
The game was not decided in nine games, and entered an extended period starting with the exceptional undefeated second half of the season.
Big Valley was the last nine-time runner-up, as well as the second-most-reviewed runner-up.
Angel made 10 appearances, leading the way with a painful goal from Walsh, and the first-ever goal from the side was a good catch from Orson, who sent the ball to the third team.
The Grand Valley, which was caught between two and three rounds, was a touchdown.
Angel then, after two deadly rounds, finally fell to two goals for the eighth-seeded Simons.
Behind that, Angel pitched a dead-two, three-run pinch, with a rolling roll of the ball and a kick-off.
Here, the new manager, Madden, is making a shift to five innings, but Roberts has already let number four Davis walk on four balls.
The left-arm replacement, Milner, carried the full ball that would be the sajonara to 5th Olson to the right-wing seat and the game was decided.
Once again in isolation...Jo木村33 households56 people are threatened with heavy rainfall in the southern center of the province on the 26th day after the flood caused the temporary bridge to flow.
In Nagano Prefecture, heavy rain is expected to fall in the southern half of the country on the 26th, and the central and southern parts of the country need to be alert to the sandstorm.
In Jo-Mura, the prefecture's roadblock has been blocked, once again isolating the inhabitants.
The rivers that are flooded are fed and flooded by mud or temporary bridges.
At just after 3 a.m., a surveillance camera installed by the prefectural Idaho Construction Office in Jojimura was found.
This was a new circuit built on the riverbed, replacing the prefectural road that had been blocked by landslides, and for 17 days was restricted to residents' cars.
With this, 33 households in the 56-person area of Osaka are once again isolated, and the Idaho Construction Office wants to get involved in water reclamation work as the water drains.

"Zul shuffle" is not a "Moment" ... ?
I heard the people of Chihuahua "words I didn't really think were dialect" (ねとらぼ) - Yahoo! News
The people of Chiba Prefecture, near the city, are from Tokyo.
He has lived in the same province for less than 30 years since his birth.
"Zul shuffle", which means "passage", was used in a conversation with a university friend in Tokyo, and was instantly taken for granted.
I was able to understand the meaning of the flow and the sense of the language, but I was told by the people of Tokyo, 玉 prefecture, "Don't use it".
― Surely "to be a whore and a whore?"
Since it is connected to the other, the meaning can be guessed in some way.
And then another one.
This is not something that was pointed out and noticed, but the expression "my home" was a dialect when I was an adult, reading books or not at all, asking friends or not.
- "We are" is... was it?
I also use it locally, but I didn't realize that I'd grown up and naturally lost it.
The Japanese "cool Chinese" is not a Chinese joke ... ?
"Cold cuisine" is not a popular term in modern business. - Yahoo! News
In China, it is cold, while in China it is "Japanese cold".
As I mentioned at the beginning, cold Chinese is a Chinese cuisine (Japanese Chinese) that originated in Japan, conceived on the basis of Chinese "涼面" (リャンバンミエン/冷やし混ぜそば) ".
Thus, originally it did not exist in China, but due to the diversity of food, it began to be found in Japanese food stores in summer.
Also recently, the Japanese system kitchen has featured arrangements with the labels 'Japanese rice cold face/Japanese rice cold face/Chinese rice cold face/Siechuan chicken cold face/Chinese rice cold face'.
On the other hand, pushed by popular punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan and Hunan, Japanese Chinese is not as popular in China at all.
Of course, the taste of Japanese Chinese is often familiar to Chinese too.
So, while not unpleasant, it tends to be criticized as lacking in impact.
"Cold China" is no exception, and China still has a minor presence.
For this reason, the Chinese name for cooling in China is "Japanese cooling".
For the Chinese, it is recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines.
The summer's theme is "Kuripi (Ryanpi) "
Is not the Chinese cuisine that feels like summer "涼皮 (リャンピー) "?
Although many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, the涼皮 is a flat-bottomed dough made from wheat flour, rice flour, denpon, and other ingredients that originated in the Shanxi province.
It is said to have a 2,000-year history.
The price of the B-grade snack, which is also sold in the stalls, is very affordable, both in front and behind.
The word "cool" is in it, but it never gets cold in Japanese or Chinese, like ice cream.
Rather, the normal temperature is basic.
On top of the onion, chopped onions, onions, and tomatoes, top your favorite ingredients, and add spices such as patty, cinnamon, raisins, and onions.
Finally, mixed with a specialised seasoning, including olive oil, garlic, oats, peanut butter, and other spices.
The more often the throat is swollen, the more often the sour and sour and thick, bitter tares are entangled, the more often the summertime is swollen, and the more often the appetite is lost.
Also, because it is widespread throughout China, there are various toppings and flavors, and variations are also a feature of the cooler skin, one of the funniest.
 Expert commentary!
"Cold water shower" benefits the body and mind. - Yahoo! News
It helps to control inflammation such as muscle pain.
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy found that both physical and mental healing effects can be expected.
By taking cold water after exercise, you can reduce the effects of muscle pain and other inflammation.
According to Professor Douglas Kasa, who teaches at the University of Connecticut and is the head of the Korean Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine, "it is important to exercise and take a cold shower without wasting as much time as possible.By lowering body temperature immediately after exercise, recovery from exercise-induced inflammation and fatigue is quicker".
 Reduce fatigue 
Exercising at high temperatures usually requires more blood flow to the heart, muscles, and skin.
"When exercising, the heart rate increases blood flow to the heart, muscle flow increases because it requires energy to contract muscles, and when it comes to the skin, there is a lot of blood flow to regulate body temperature", says Professor Kassa.
"A cold shower can reduce blood flow to the skin by lowering the temperature of the skin; instead, it can flow to the intestines, such as the stomach and intestines, making moisture and nutrition easier to consume after exercise; as a result, it can reduce the fatigue after exercise".
Looking forward to the Hormistice Effect.
Drosefsky also explains that by pouring cold water, one can expect the "Holmistic effect" to start.
The Hormistic Effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances or stress than nothing at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, fasting, and cold-water showers are exemplary of the health-promoting effects of the homicide that can be expected. By doing cold-water showers, hormones and neurotransmitters can be stimulated, and physical and physical strength and resilience can be enhanced".

Osaka-sama-san, two battles of the war!
矢野 director "watching and style" (サンケイスポーツ) - Yahoo!News
(Se-liga, 中日2-5 Osaka-神, 7 rounds, Osaka-神4 wins 3 losses, 24 days, NagoyaD) 4th round is going on forever.
The ball, which was danced high and high, was shot into the middle of the left-wing seat.
The mountain has two consecutive battle arches, a diamond for a week.
When he returned to the bench, he had his teeth whitened.
"While I was good at swinging, I was able to narrow the target ball and deliberately swing".
Four 0-2s, he took the lead and took the seat.
He was actively swinging from the first ball, the second after Fowler.
He didn't miss the 134kg slide that was sweeping him.
The ball in the center was a perfect shot, enough to convince the player that he was standing at the moment.
A two-match series following the Battle of Hiroshima on 23rd of the previous day was a blow to the counterattack.
It was also a valuable piece of paper that was struck by someone who was struggling.
Against the O's on the 17th against the O's on the 17th against the O's on the 9th with 4 points and 4 assists.
But, as far as Nagaodao is concerned, the previous 12-game schedule allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold, and it had been plagued by seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013, when it was drawn.
From such a difficult opponent, the Nagao-Dome did not pass the game, taking away the 23 innings (the score on the way down was also counted in the first innings) with a fast pass.
Director Yayoi Yano also said, "It's a high level to keep the sweet ball tight, look and style, play time and atmosphere in the foul, and I think you'll still be able to play".
He once pitched right-handed, marking six straight games and three consecutive multiple games.
The start was a slow start, but seven shots, 16 points, and 16 points are already working out as a team leader and fourth.
For the sake of victory, we will continue to leave the results behind.

岩HC"United for a medal" Rugby sevens men, four months of cohabitation - Yahoo! news
The head coach of Japan's rugby sevens men's national team, HC, said in response to an online press interview on 25th, that he was determined to "unite and work together towards the medal goal" for the Tokyo Five, which was postponed to next year.
After the five-round draw was postponed, the 2016 Rio de Janeiro World Championships head coach San Watering (Rio de Janeiro) Hirotsuchi and the Fukuoka-san, who also represented the 15-man World Cup in the same tournament, withdrew from the team.
The commander added, "Of course the impact is great, and players who can fight together are moving forward".
From this date, the team is divided into Tokyo and will begin to represent the candidate accommodation.
Accommodation with accommodation will be available from March until 28th, but no contact training will be conducted as a precautionary measure to prevent infection with the new coronavirus.
Although the relegation of the top group, which can play the entire seven-man World Series from next season, has been decided, and the organisation of the World Series itself, which is going to turn the world around, is not transparent, the HHC has revealed that it is negotiating a narrowing of the number of opponents in the country that allows the entry of its representatives, and a strengthened match.
Medical workers were infected in Nagano Prefecture for the first time in 40 years of women visiting the Red Cross Hospital to perform PCR testing on all contacts.
A woman in her 40s in Yangon Prefecture's city of Yangon has been found to be infected with the new coronavirus.

This means that four people in a family of "intense contact" with mild symptoms have no symptoms.
The women worked until the 16th, and no confirmed visits outside the prefecture were made in the two weeks before the onset.
The pathways of infection are currently under investigation.
The Red Cross Hospital, the first hospital for women to report infection, announced that staff were infected 24 hours a day.

The Macao casino regulatory authorities are monitoring the implementation of the epidemic prevention measures in the casino facilities... the new coronavirus negative certificate suggestion at the time of entry must be adapted.
Forty casino facilities in Macau have been closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19, following the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection, and are reopening operations after February 20 to take strict prevention measures.
The DICJ requires operating companies to ensure maximum protection of the health of employees and guests during reopening, to ensure distance between gaming tables, to accommodate the need for seats to be empty at table games (e.g. a three- to four-person buckle table at a time), to operate one or two slot machines at a time, and to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Decomposition of gaming items such as chips has also been intensified.
Guests are also required to provide a warning of wearing a mask, testing, valid health code at the time of entry (whether there is a recent history of stay, a history of contact with new coronavirus patients, symptoms such as fever or cough, etc.) generated by entering a contact.
From 0:00 a.m. on July 15, the notice of a new coronavirus nucleic acid test negative certificate (except for those issued during the validity period by an approved facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was also added to the condition.
In the context of the newly mandated negative certificate, which will be issued from 6 a.m. on 15 May, there will be a relaxation of the water level measures between Macau and Guangdong Province (with the abolition of the 14-day quarantine period, subject to conditions) and a precautionary measure to be taken.
DICJ received a change in the conditions of entry from July 18, and announced that the same agency's directors had reviewed the implementation of the epidemic prevention measures in the casino facilities, held a meeting with security representatives from the casino operators, and called on the board to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the entrance of guests.
The DICJ has stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities, and will have the opportunity to meet with the operating company and its staff regularly to assess the situation and assess the situation, and will also appropriately adjust the casino's prevention measures in line with the guidelines of the government's health department.
The casino facility was also visited by the directors of the Health Department's Lin松 Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who were accompanied by instructors on how to disinfect gaming chips on the spot and how to take safe distances between the seats of electronic casino machines.
Due to the sharp decline in inbound travelers due to the prevention measures, including entry restrictions, the casino sales for January-June this year have remained at a 77.4% decrease from the same period of the previous year, at 337.2 billion yen.
The water flows from the hot spring to the light of the moon, and the moon is turned into a feast of bliss.
With the new coronavirus affecting the annual "Festival of the Waterfall" being cancelled, the annual "Festival of the Waterfall" will begin with a waterfall commemorating support messages to healthcare professionals from August 1.

The festival is an event that recreates the festival featured in the anime "Flowers of the Rainbow", which is modeled after the hot spring, and is organized by the Hot Spring Tourism Association.
The anime began airing in 2011 and is visited by a large number of anime fans from all over the country every year.
Every day, from the lighting ceremony in July to the October of this festival, the water of the sumptuous waterfall is lit by lighting the stairs leading up to the lighthouse.

So far, about 50 children in the local watershed have been asked to write one-by-one illustrated messages, and more than 100 applications have been submitted from across the country.
The message paper can be purchased from the association's homepage, filled in, returned to the association in a credit envelope and sent to the association, where it can be hung in a tray and received a photo of the light.
At 1 set of 16 thousand yen, applications are accepted until the total number of applications reaches about 350k.
The lights are scheduled to be turned on until the end of November.
Shinsuke, who is the festival's first executive chairman, said: "Reading the message will encourage us too. Next year we want to celebrate the festival, which will be the tenth edition of the festival".

In any case, in the amateur era, the master will have experience and a double sense of responsibility.
Taking over as captain from Sakanakawa at the age of four, Kanzaki, who is a "captain who pulls the team with words because Sakanakawa is good at talking anyway; on the contrary, I am a mouth-watering vice-captain, so the type who talks is the type who leaves the conversation behind, and who is behind", said that each of them has their own personality while supporting the newly-formed Gen. Sakanakawa, the new player chairman's forest.
The director said, "Sooneda's safety? that's not a sign. But, it's a 'can do it' idea. His friendship was a great band.
All four are now struggling with a batting rate of 20 percent, but they are supporting the team with wisdom to win without even playing.

Embape, who was injured after being tacked by a bad guy, will be leaving the venue in a clawed stick. - Yahoo! News
Paris Saint-Germain, who beat Saint-Étienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final at the Stade de France on 24 July, clocked their 13th win in two years.
PSG have won two domestic titles.
Neymar's goal in the first half, which knocked down Saint-Étienne in the final, was the final, while PSG, who have won two domestic titles following League One, are in a situation of concern for the Champions League in August.
Kilian Embape, who had earlier appeared in the same match, was injured by a bad sliding tackle by his opponent CBroyck Peran.
The young French star, who fell in the first half to the point of being stuck in his right leg, turned his face in pain.
The players of both teams during this game became a flashback, a fight-or-flight riot.
Embape, who appears to have hit his right leg, is unlikely to continue playing.
Perran was presented with a red card.
After the game, Embape, who had fixed his right leg, set foot behind the stadium with a pine cane.
PSG will play the final of the Coupe de la Ligue against Lyon at 4:10 pm Japanese time on 1 August, but it will definitely be impossible to use Embape in this match.
You will have to wait for the club's medical report, but you may be able to miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona is "Near Art" online museum "HASARD" 野さん (80s) launched by the Delhi-based East-West News Agency (DNT) - Yahoo! news
There is a museum where anyone can get free access to art whenever they want.
The collection includes a wide range of works, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustave Klimt, to unknown domestic artists.
The online museum "HASARD (Azhar) " has received even more attention since its "opening" in April 2019 from its convenience and novelty to capture users' hearts, and from the new lifestyle created by the coronavirus pandemic.
A representative of the site, 野真之介 from the city of 八戸, who launched the site, says, "Everyone wanted to create a service that could easily enjoy art.
When visiting Azad, you will be amazed at the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of 24 January, the company has launched 14 exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and project exhibitions, attracting audiences to ultra-high-resolution works that not only touch color but also pen texture.
There is no registration fee or admission fee, and the exhibition is free of charge for the viewer and the artist who wants to open the exhibition.
Online presentations also attract attention.
Moving a painting is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It's Moving Again", he has been digitally transformed to make clouds, flowers, meadows, and so on move.
"I want to get people who are not interested in art involved" (野代表) makes me feel like I'm in a painting.
The representative and the artist came together in elementary school.
When he and his family visited the then-recently completed Aosun Prefectural Museum, he was shocked by the urgency of seeing three huge paintings of Mark Shaggar's "Aleko".
From the next day, art classes turned into fun times, and after college, I started to fly, and then to go to galleries and so on.
I felt that many people had little opportunity to experience art from various points of view, such as the fact that museums were not nearby, large project exhibitions were just taking place in the capital region, and parenting was difficult.
So, after working for an IT company, I spent about two months on the Internet, where I started a website where I could view art.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone could see art at any time, in a free way, and enjoy it -
The Azeri goal has been accepted by more people, even though the coronavirus pandemic has not.
The representative of 野 emphasizes that art viewing enriches the imagination about the meaning of art.
"As your imagination becomes rich, you will be able to reach out to those in need.
By drawing closer to art, we want it to be a better society.'"
The simple reason why China's quality era is over, and Japan's quality era is coming is that modern business is coming.
A pandemic shift in values has been reported.
There are many predictions and debates about a post-pandemic world.
In business terms, the changes described in the July 8 article "The jobs of managers are starting to disappear in Japan now ... !that cruel reality" and the July 4 article "In a post-coronavirus world, the Japanese manufacturing industry is likely to have a major resurgence !".
Photo The true nature of "Japan's strength" that only the Japanese know about... the unexpected reality seen in Asia
Also, in a spiritual sense, the June 26 article "The 'True Burning Mind' given to those who have become aware of the end of life with corona" and the June 10 article "Coron, riot-filled right now, let us review the effectiveness of 'God's Prayer in the Time of Trouble' seem to be becoming mainstream".
And what seems to be clearly visible to our eyes as the combination of these two "materials" and "spirits" is the great flow of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, it is annoying to have a bad or flawed T-shirt or digital camera, but the life of the buyer is no different.
In contrast, the recent high-quality Chinese-made masks and respirators, which have been the subject of much discussion, are deadly in products that directly link life and safety.
Such goods cannot be bought, however cheap.
At a reasonable price, they will seek products of "Japanese quality".
This flow of people is not just happening in Japan, of course.
Western countries, which are facing a difficult situation due to lack of masks and medical equipment, are still very bad at "Chinese quality" and have repeatedly "returned" their goods.
More security than safety.
Also, goods such as automobiles are also goods that can be defective and fatal (accident death).
The reason why, no matter how many countries start off with the "good or bad" sales strategy, the Japanese manufacturer is ultimately unable to overcome the situation, is that the June 16 article "Are the world's automakers still going to win alone, are the world's automakers going to bow to Toyota?" makes the situation similar to the one stated in the June 16 article "Are the world's automakers going to bow to Toyota?" because the automotive product is highly demanded by the "Japanese quality".
And this pandemic, like many other products, has reminded us that "safety and security" is needed.
Also, safety is important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like toilet paper noise, even if the production capacity is adequate, the intermediate flow may be stuck and not reaching the target.
Furthermore, as in the April 17 article "Who are the real culprits of the lack of masks! Don't Forgive the Fireplace Thieves of the Chinese Communist Party's regime", self-sufficiency in Japan was also painfully felt as an important element of "reassurance and security".
When it comes down to it, it is very important that each country prioritizes its own country, so that it can get basic supplies such as masks and food items from its home country.
South Korea's new coronavirus infections have been 115 days in the country with more than 100 people = 86 people coming overseas the most.

98% reflection is required.
The teflon processed flyspan is found to be white painted, heat-disrupted and improve the cooling effect!
What a breakthrough!
This year was a rainy season with unprecedented annual rainfall, but it is clear that the hot summer will be more standardized.
Those days of so much heat that the hot and hot and even the cold room could not function... just imagine, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been shrinking in wisdom about how to get through the hot summer even a little more comfortably.
One way is to wear thin, white clothes.
Well, why don't you wear a black dress that absorbs heat in the summer?
And, applying the same principle to the construction of homes, more and more cases of white painting are occurring.
Whether white can be painted with a characteristic color that reflects more light and absorbs less heat, or whether it is a new field of study, was also a recent area of research.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA, in collaboration with researchers at Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, has discovered a white paint blending method that can best efficiently repress solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
The aim is to implement it early.
The highest reflection rate of sunlight ever was white paint, which used titanium oxide, which reached 85% reflection rate.
White paint, which already uses titanium oxide, is being applied to rooftops in high-temperature buildings, etc. and is used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was recently discovered was a white paint derived from the phosphate resin of polytratrazole peroethylene (PTFE), which is used in some of those tephron-processed flys, etc.
With the white paint that applies this Teflon effect, it is thought to be able to significantly reduce heat by reflecting sunlight to almost 98% of the time.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the accidental white painting using tephron, the interior is easy to pass without being exposed to the heat.
Perhaps such a time is coming soon, isn't it?
It's interesting that the roof of Japanese houses has a lot of dark colors, but from now on, will white house be the mainstream?
When is the annual Amazon sales, this year's event?
On July 21, MCNBC reported that Amazon.com had revealed the extension of the annual large-scale sale "Prime Day".
It is held annually in July, but this year it was reported that the new coronavirus infection was forced to be postponed due to the spread of the virus.
■ PR Officer :" Details will be announced soon" Amazon's PR Officer said in a statement:
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to for the past five years, and this year it will be held later than usual, while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and suppliers".
However, he did not specify a specific date for the event, stating only that "details will be announced soon".
Meanwhile, the Indian event was decided.
He posted a press release on his country's website.
He explained that the implementation will take place on August 6 from 08:00 am to 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year may take unusual measures.
■ Amazon, a large event that will sell 76 billion yen in two days, launched a large sale to this membership in 2015 as a way to promote sales in the summer months, which will reduce sales.
Originally a 24-hour event, it has expanded each year to include 48 hours on July 15 from 08:00 a.m. to 48 hours in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Australia, and many others.
Last year, the company reported that two days of sales exceeded previous sales records for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The event also contributed to the new membership of Premium, with last year's first-day registrations being the highest in a single day, followed by the next day.
Last year, it also sold 175 million items worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a specialist magazine in the online retail industry, reported that global sales in the two days were $71.76 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Mobile number transfers, a tough eye for excessive withdrawal.
What about the fee and the point payout?
(news) - Yahoo! news
The General Ministry is standardizing the consideration of a review of the same number transfer system (MNP) that will keep the traditional phone number when changing mobile phone companies.
At the 21st meeting of experts, they outlined a policy to amend the MNP guidelines, which were adopted in 2004.
The specific arguments for the MNP hand-counting method and the right to withdraw for those who wish to move are of varying nature.
While feedback from telecommunications companies is also expected, attention is focused on whether it can be linked to promoting healthy market competition.
The original user fee was 2000 yen in 2006, when the black MNP was introduced by telecommunications companies, far from the mobile switchover topic.
The MNP fee revenue of the three largest mobile phone companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen annually.
The General Ministry of Communications on 21st, at a meeting of experts discussing the competitive environment of the telecommunications market, listed the current state of affairs regarding the MNP at the "Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules (WG) ".
The issuance of the MNP reservation number, which is required when a consumer moves to another telecommunications company, is given in the time, time, and manner in which the consumer is required to make the reservation.
Although large telecommunications companies are accepting web-based applications, and for convenience of operating the underlying system, the acceptance timeframe is mainly 9-20 hours.
The WG documentation sets out the principle of day-to-day response as a guideline for future consideration.
For those who wish to transfer to MNP, mobile phone companies are also problematic in trying to hold back points by giving them points.
This is because of the judgement that excessive retention can hinder fair competition.
The North Jun Jun Jun Jun partner of the Yokohama General Research Institute, a member of the WG, suggests that "we will be able to give a brief explanation of the economic benefits offered or to obtain permission from the user, and will promptly issue a number to the unauthorized user and terminate the process.
But, among a series of arguments, the structural problem of the MNP fee is that "the higher the customer, the more difficult it is to get out, the more motivation to actively lower it is difficult to work" (a spokesman for the General Ministry).
There is also concern that if there is an operator who leads the way in lowering the MNP fee, the company will increase the customer flow and the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The General Ministry also points out that many overseas countries do not charge users a user fee for MNP, and it is likely that this will happen in Japan as well.
The General Ministry would like to compile the results of the WG in a report by September-October, and then consider starting the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
The period of time for the amendment to be made is considered to be after 21.
Mobile phone companies are likely to be a source of headaches, including sales and customer support.
China-Japan-Singapore, six times without losing, won, lost, and lost the right to bet - Yahoo! News
中日・勝野慶投手 (23) was 25日, Osaka-神8 is a round of the first round of the Nakayama Dome.
Six of the four games were unbeaten.

The two-way forward, who both made the starting lineup this season and the previous 18-game Osaka-song, suffered from a hammering, and was down four times.
This time, it was a backwater mound of soldiers fighting to survive, without performing their primary role.
This time, the good-looking Tiger attacked the line-up with a strong, emotional ball.
When a 140-kilometer-long straight ball was running, a change ball such as a counting ball could also be used effectively.
Six times he hit the first two shots to the left-center of the lead, but he did not make the big left, he did not score two goals, he did not score two.
In the match against Fujitsu, which I met here, I was chased by two goals, and finally by a fork.
He took three shots and kicked a three-run home run in a three-ball tie.
The winner fielded 83 goals after six, but at the same time as the midfield game ended, he and manager Tenda came off the bench and switched pitchers.
The striker, who scored 108 goals at the same time, was not able to secure the right to win the first game of the season, as he was the first to get off the mound.

A stolen Ferrari found at the bottom of the river 26 years ago is unrecoverable.

Time passed and the police could not solve it, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.

By matching the VIN number to the database of the stolen car, we were able to link this Ferrari to the 1994 event.
The car is handed over to the insurance company, which is the legal owner of the car, and then to the scrapper.
Scrap dealer Lowie van DE Ooyevaar says that "there are still some remaining parts, but they are for the art of decorating. I've already received many requests from people who want to make a table out of a broken-down mondial. I use engine blocks and glass plates".
Meanwhile, no concrete sales are being considered, and scrappers are keeping it as an object.

45% of households with wives holding a wallet!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
"Isn't there a wife who is a bit of a mess this month and is told by her husband that she is not getting enough money?"
The family in which this conversation is established is the family where the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have a wife holding a wallet?
Let's also look at the percentage of "married couples sharing a wallet" that they "manage together".
Who holds the household purse?
The following results are from a survey conducted by the 松井証券株式会社, which surveyed the Internet of "Equity in Couples' Household Management" (published June 2) of a survey of 20 to 30 male and female couples in the country over three years of marriage, and of 400 male and female couples in their 50s to 60s over 30 years of marriage, for a total of 800.
Who holds the household purse?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most recent results were in families where the wife manages household chores.
Whether it's managing or not, there are some overlapping curves to household management, but there seem to be different episodes.
Wife manages household: In case of a child, A child is Arafif's mother-in-law, who has a high school 3-year-old and a high school-graduate daughter.
A son is in charge of the entire household.
The university exams were delayed and the school year was in full swing, and the deficit was increasing for months, so she negotiated a reduction in her husband's allowance, but was resisted.
When he was asked to "show me what balance it is", he showed me his household account book.
Although it should have listed all expenses, looking at the family accounts was not a deficit-sharing balance.
Her husband was about to say, "I've had enough", but her son said, "I understand, I'm not strong enough to manage the household, so please manage everything".
Later, when she interviewed her husband, she said that "although she was unhappy with the way small amounts were handled, she was not really happy with the way the various household items were handled (such as school supplies and PTA fees) but she had no time or energy to manage them".
Husband manages household expenses: In the case of B's son, the son of a single-family wife, B, is paid by her husband for living expenses and is daily cutting through.
Last spring, the fridge part of the fridge broke down and B asked her husband to "buy a fridge".
But the husband hesitated to buy the replacement, saying, "The freezer is not working, but the refrigerator part is still working, so it's okay".
But in the summer, she said, her husband wanted to create an environment where he could always eat ice cream, and she thought, "I'm sure I'll buy a refrigerator".
So, B's son suddenly complained to his friend, "My husband is too boring".
Before the move of the British, Spain was limited to five clubs.
This season, the transfer of the Japanese representative MF久保建英 (MF久保建英) who played for Spain1 division Majorká seems to be gradually being narrowed.
Although Majorka was downgraded to two episodes, Kubo's performance at the end of the season was dramatically upgraded.
However, the same player who has "holding rights" in relation to the non-EU framework will have difficulty returning to Real Madrid and will play for another club next season.
Although offers have already been received from around 30 clubs, Madrid is committed to allowing martial arts practice in its home clubs.
Spanish newspaper Marco reported that, as a precursor to the Kupa move, several clubs in the country, including Real Sociedad, Bialiar, Granada, Hetáfe, Betis, and others, were strong and "five clubs are interested in acquiring Kupa, but Madrid wants clubs above the league average".
In addition, the BRL will have the right to play in next season's Europa League, while Granada will also qualify from the second round of the EL qualifiers and comply with the conditions of the team requested by Madrid.
So what decision will the world's number one big club make about the "Japanese treasure" going?
