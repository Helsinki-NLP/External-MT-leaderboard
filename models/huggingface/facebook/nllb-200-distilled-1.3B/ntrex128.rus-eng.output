Members of the Welsh Assembly don't want to look like Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly are dissatisfied with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (from English Member of the Welsh Parliament  member of the Parliament of Wales).
The problematic solution is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour member, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation  would be shortened to Twp and Pwp.
For our non-Welsh readers: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp cock.
According to a member of the Assembly from the Welsh Party, his organisation was "generally unhappy" and offered other options.
The Conservative Party does not object to the new abbreviation, but notes that MWP is spelled similarly to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, issued the following statement: The final decision on the names of the Assembly Members will, of course, remain with them.
The National Assembly for Wales is authorised to change its name by the Government of Wales Act 2017.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the proposed options, which found that the Parliament of Wales instead of the Assembly had broad support among the local population.
As regards the names of the Assembly members, the Committee has preferred the Members of the Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP) option, while the MWP option has received the most public support.
It seems that the Assembly members are proposing other options, but it will not be easy for the Chairman, Elin Jones, to find a solution that satisfies everyone.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly's work process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the Committee system.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is designed to resolve a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name Republic of Macedonia implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against its northern neighbor's entry into the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will not recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the country's name  is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Harlem parishes: the bells of St. Martin's are silenced forever
"The older people I spoke to in the neighborhood said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", says Adams.
And now there's nothing left of either.
The disappearance of bars can be understood by:
The format of communication has changed.
The bar is no longer the neighborhood's living room, the kind of place you used to go to regularly.
But the worry for the churches is that the proceeds from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter what their leaders hope.
The church site, he added, would be replaced by a multi-apartment building whose residents would be unlikely to support the parishes that remain in the area.
"Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white", Adams says. "And that brings us closer to the day when these churches will be closed for good because the new neighbors will never be their parishioners".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first Methodist parishioners left in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black parish that lived next door.
When St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black community, it was led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping artery, where blacks were refused employment or promotion.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by fire, and during the restoration work, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Johnson's son, who succeeded him as rector of St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "Bells for the Poor".
But an expert who tested the carillon in July called it "cultural heritage" and "unique historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, also noted that the carillon at St. Martin's was the first instrument of its kind in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was invited to play on a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, the St. Martin's Church has yet to find a replacement.
The last few months have been a difficult one around St. Martin's Church with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, in July addressed the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese would "try to shift the cost of the works" to the parish assembly, although the latter had no bearing on the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Officials say a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and injured on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season in California.
The attack happened around 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help about half an hour later, and they went to the scene in a boat and pulled him out.
According to Hummel, he first thought the boy was loudly rejoicing to catch the lobster, but quickly realized he was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
When Hammel swam up to the diver, he noticed that his skin around his clavicle was completely torn.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark!'", says Hummel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is listed as critical.
The shark that attacked the teenager is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a press briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not listed as a threatened species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have sealed off the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure public safety.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury 's planning to take over the UK perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to set up cosmetics and perfume departments at Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with consultant cosmetologists, modeled after luxury department stores.
The UK's £2.8bn perfume and cosmetics market continues to expand, while fashion and home goods sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this coveted market, 11 stores across the country will have spacious cosmetics and perfume departments as an experiment, and if successful, many more stores are expected to follow next year.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill shelves that were previously reserved for TVs, microwaves, and home goods, and investing in the perfume and cosmetics market seems to be a good solution.
According to Sainsbury's, the company plans to double its range of cosmetics to 3,000 items, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, following the pattern of the Booths store.
In addition, the branded product line of Boutique Cosmetics will be reorganized with a shift to vegan products to meet the demands of younger buyers.
Two Sainsbury's stores will feature fragrance kiosks from Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food each day in small shops near the house have forced supermarkets to attract customers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury's, says that outlets will gradually become department stores, and his supermarket chain is fighting for customers in a competition with low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury's supermarkets have Argos outlets, and some of them now have Habitat stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago, leading to increased food sales and revenue from those acquisitions.
Previous attempts to revive the beauty and pharmacy departments have failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sainsbury's and Boots was formed, but later disagreements arose over the distribution of income from the sale of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of Sainsbury's pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Selesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products from La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer: "We have completely redesigned the look and feel of our perfumery and cosmetics departments to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We also have specially trained counselors who are always ready to help with counseling.
Our range of brands, pleasant design and convenient location will attract a lot of visitors looking for cosmetics and perfumes.
Peter Jones has reacted angrily to Holly Willoughby 's exit from an £11m deal .
Star of the show "Log of the Dragon" Peter Jones is "angry" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal she was supposed to make with Peter's lifestyle brand but instead opted for new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint brand of homewear and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host announced her decision on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has drawn the ire of Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Lair.
According to our sources, Jones was "angry" when a television fan favorite admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that after signing new contracts worth up to £1.5m she would not have enough time for their shared brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
Their brand was compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and sales were expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram, while Jones left the UK on a private jet heading to one of her villas.
According to one source, the Truly brand was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would have provided her with a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision stunned all parties to the deal.
Everyone was stunned by Tuesday's launch, as the stamp was only weeks away.
The headquarters in Marlow had a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as a potential delay in launching the line.
It is also a matter of breaking off long-standing friendships.
Raising three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Tara Cappe in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over as the company's board chair in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of the TV production company of Dan Baldwin.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We can't comment on his commercial dealings".
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media's attack on him for his "unworthy president" comment and positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump turn down so many claims?
Said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn't say no to anything.
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step toward reducing North Korea's nuclear stockpile.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying North Korea was still waiting for "appropriate response" from the US after the DPRK's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
During a gathering of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
"North Korea is doing great", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to repair relations with Kim Jong-un have paid off: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been released, and the remaining American troops in North Korea have also returned home.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there was nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
"Being a proper president is so easy, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street rushing into this crowded hall, there would be only 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: devastation in the hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake struck Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is homeless, the government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, so it was not easy", says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palau, but we don't know if a foreign team can work there.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given Indonesia's ongoing seismic instability, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, the city of Palu did not have a warning siren, which is likely to have caused so many casualties.
Transportation between Indonesia's many islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously docked in Lombok to help earthquake victims is heading to Palau, but the journey to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made strengthening Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a major focus of his election campaign and spent vast sums on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for another term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for escalating the sectarian feud between Indonesia's conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced in clashes between Christians and Muslims armed with machetes, arrows and other self-propelled guns.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge compares scores against Chelsea with a goal in the far upper corner of the goal
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from relegation in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Jordon Shakiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and he hit the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and landed in the far top corner of the net.
Goalkeeper Kepa Arrisbalaga jumped towards the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with Liverpool FC.com, Sturridge said: "It was all about getting in that position and getting the ball, players like Shaq always play their best on offense, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible".
I saw Kante coming towards me, I took the ball and, without thinking, I hit the goal.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0, with a goal scored by Belgian Eden Azar in the 25th minute.
Chelsea's centre-forward, passing back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field into half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic made a one-touch play.
He then passed the pass to Azar, who went to the goal.
Azar overtook the defence and hit from the left flank into the corner of the net, bypassing Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play Videotone in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will be held on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
Indonesia 's tsunami death toll has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Management Agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly still trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official with the agency, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was engulfed in the rubble of collapsed houses.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death.
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, and a murder investigation is underway.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Mews complex on John Street.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among the local residents.
This is Detective Inspector O'Hagan: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I strongly urge anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead and may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on video, to contact us with any information that may help the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found in the compound.
This afternoon, alleged victims arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver living in the Grayson Mews complex tried to get into his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he lost his speech.
The residents were told they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the officers told the tenant that the entire area was a crime scene.
One woman started crying.
"What a horror!" she repeated.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses arrived at the scene, and another one remained outside the fenced area.
Several police officers have been placed inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
Anyone with information is asked to send a private message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 (case 247 dated 30 September).
The Cromwell monument in front of the parliament building has sparked a heated debate about " rewriting history "
Cromwell's banishment would be a well-deserved revenge for the barbaric destruction of England's many cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of a statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the anti-icon movement during the English Civil War.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man who many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, saw Cromwell as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether such a view is historically accurate remains a matter of debate.
But it's safe to say that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure who represented one side of that divide.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also highly esteemed and respected.
Chinese farmer bitten to death by a killer pig
A farmer in a market in southwest China has been killed by a pig, local media report.
The bloodied body of the victim (only his last name, Yuán, is mentioned in the media) with a ruptured artery was found near a loaf of bread in a market in the Lupanshū district of Guizhou province in southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Sinin County, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin found Juan's lifeless body, with the door to the neighboring pigsty open.
There was a huge snake in the pigsty with blood on the barrel.
A forensic examination found that a 250-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs were bloodied and maimed", Wu, a relative of the dead man, told the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate pen for the duration of the investigation to prevent further attacks.
Yuan's family is reportedly in talks with the market administration about compensation for the farmer's death.
The number of cases of pig attacks on humans is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., severely injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let him go, only to be scared off by his overgrown wife.
In 2012, a case was reported of a farmer in Oregon, USA, being eaten by his own pigs. A Canadian farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a "trigger mechanism".
Pigs are playful,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to instill in your pets a sense of moderation and respect", he explained.
Hurricane Rose will bring heavy rain to much of the southwest United States .
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves through a cooler water zone toward the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring heavy rain and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
As of Saturday morning, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure area is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and approaching the coast of Southern California, bringing tropical moisture north from Mexico into the southwest United States.
Monday, more than 10 inches of rain is expected in Mexico.
With tropical humidity in the area of low pressure, heavy rain is expected in the southwest.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous downpours, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, the high tropical humidity can cause rainfall to reach 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
In some areas of the southwest, mostly in Arizona, up to 5 inches of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden, rapid flooding due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the current risk of rainfall, walking in the desert can be a serious risk.
Showers can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause gusty winds and dust clouds to rise.
As the low pressure zone emerges, there will be heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause small mudflows and create slippery surfaces on roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
There will be some tropical rain in Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and it will spread to other areas by Monday night and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the downpour will be in the Four Corners area and will continue until Wednesday evening.
Throughout the United States, temperatures will drop sharply in October, due to low Arctic temperatures and high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination causes large temperature changes over a small area.
Such dramatic temperature changes will be especially noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis and De Moines (Iowa) is almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
Over the next few days, the summer heat will build up and spread to other areas.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience warm weather in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees in the region from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
In New York City, Tuesday, the temperature could reach 27 degrees, 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises a high probability of unusually high temperatures on the U.S. East Coast through mid-October.
The Senate hearing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh was watched by over 20 million viewers .
Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew more than 20 million viewers on six television channels on Thursday.
The political standoff over Kavanaugh's nomination took an unexpected turn on Friday when the media broke an urgent story that Republican Jeff Flake had made it a condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the lawyer within a week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, assaulted her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave an emotional statement saying he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, the debate was watched by 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
Also, Nielsen ratings do not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison, we're talking about the average audience watching a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment: the all-day Senate hearing drew an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC  2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, while CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
After the hearings, interest in the case has not diminished.
There was a real drama on Friday with Jeff Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator from Arizona announced his intention to support Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS caught Flake on camera on his way to a Friday morning meeting of the House Judiciary Committee, where he was confronted in the elevator by a group of activists who were critical of the senator.
The whole world saw him get his eyes down and beaten by angry women live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one of them.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
"You are the power, while so many women are powerless".
Flake told activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would speak about it at a committee meeting.
When the Judiciary Committee was hours later preparing to approve Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate bench for a vote, all the channels were broadcasting the hearing live.
However, Flake made one condition: an FBI investigation into the allegations against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority had sought.
Flake claims he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
He made his final decision after talking to Koons and a few other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect, as it was obvious that Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI has opened an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of playing politics around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another interview published on the same page as May's interview, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticized her so-called "Brexit Chess" plan, saying he considered the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU "absolutely ridiculous".
Police arrest Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the murder of a Louisiana State University forward .
Police have arrested a man suspected of killing Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
Baton Rouge police say 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, CBS's regional channel, police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the scene.
During questioning, Simpson admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson's bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Crime Investigation Department, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in the search and arrest.
Joe Alleva, athletic director at Louisiana State University, thanked law enforcement for their "good faith work in catching the criminal".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played for Louisiana State University.
Last season, Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Coach Will Wade made a statement Friday morning saying that the tragic death of Wade Sims was a "shock" and "a real grief" for all the players.
"This is what I've always been afraid of", the coach added.
The volcano has covered Mexico City with ash.
The Popocatepetl volcano has been burning ash in the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention advised people not to go near the volcano, which has been active for 183 days and has produced 183 vapour gas emissions.
The Center's observations suggest that there was frequent rumbling and tremors near the volcano.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimillo, social media users posted photos of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash.
After a 7.1 MW earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The Popocatepetl Volcano (or, for its own sake, Don Goyo) has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of first anniversary of independence referendum
A rally in Barcelona on Saturday, the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalonia's independence from Spain, which split the country into two camps, was marred by clashes between pro-independence supporters and police, with six rioters arrested.
Police officers pushed back pro-independence protesters, while the black-masked protesters threw eggs and powdered paint at the police, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After police fired batons to contain the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For hours, pro-independence protesters chanted: "We will not forget, we will not forgive!" while their opponents responded with: "Long live Spain!"
According to local media, 14 protesters were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
A referendum on Catalonia's independence from Spain was held on October 1 last year, which was declared illegal by the Spanish government but was a milestone for the separatists.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to leave Spain, but turnout was low because the referendum was largely boycotted by opponents of the withdrawal.
According to Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block the referendum at the country's polling stations.
On Friday, separatists spent the night on the declared route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it went down a different route.
68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who attended a separatist rally with his wife, complained that hopes for Catalonia's independence were becoming more and more shaky.
Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents cried for joy when they got the chance to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a suspended state", he says.
In the recent December local elections, Catalan pro-secession parties won a major, though narrow, victory, but this year their movement is losing supporters as many of the movement's prominent leaders are either on the run or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording a rally in support of the police, said the conflict is heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
"The tension is rising", he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders in custody since late last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
Participating in the next European Parliament elections as a candidate  is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,  he says.

Livingston's win over Rangers thanks to a goal by Mengi
Dolly Mengi 's first goal guaranteed a win for Livingston .
Livingston's goal gave him a surprise victory over Rangers, the second defeat for Scottish club manager Steven Gerrard in 18 games.
Dolly Mengi's punch equalised Gary Holt's side with Hibernian in the standings, where they share second place.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premier League this season, and will face group leaders Hartford on Sunday, who are eight points behind Rangers.
On Thursday , Rangers will play in the Europa League against Rapid Austria (Vena).
Livingston continues their unbeaten streak in the division, having played six matches and not losing since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as head coach.
Missed moments for Livingston in a fight with a tough guest.
Holt's coaching staff had to keep score from the start, and the Rangers were clearly not up to the task.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of scrimmage, but the goal from his weak attempt failed.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their defensive line, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed that important goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a pass to Meng, who scored from the centre.
By that point, the Rangers had the upper hand, but the home team's defense was unassailable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second half went on the same way, though Kelly still had to fend off Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor kicked the ball back from Scott Pittman with his foot, and Lithgow made a wide pass from the standard position.
The balls were constantly in Livingston's penalty area, but all attacks were repulsed, and two penalty requests - one for provoking reserve player Glenn Middleton by Halkett and the other for playing with his hand - were not met.
The phenomenal game of Livingston.
From BBC Scotland  Alasdair Lamont, reporting from the stadium  Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the Olympic football.
Their style of play and composition have hardly changed since their rise to the top of the rankings, and it is Coach Holt's great credit that he has mobilized this team from the very beginning.
He had a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a brilliantly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
The Rangers couldn't keep up.
Although they've had some good moments with Coach Gerrard, they didn't live up to our expectations this time.
In the final minutes of the match, they lacked possession of the ball and managed to pass the defence of the host team only once.
Erdogan 's warm welcome during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and both top officials were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to improve relations between the two NATO member countries  the visit, which was already fraught with some conflicts.
The leaders failed to find common ground on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow the 25,000-strong crowd to enter the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters lined up nearby to see their president.
Opponents of the Erdogan regime, including Kurds, gathered in the same place to condemn in full Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposing views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in car crash
In London, a car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident happened near Bethwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of Deptford, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver and the paramedics who arrived at the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile away on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car with the driver fleeing.
London police say they are currently working to identify the deceased and notify his next of kin.
Meanwhile, roads are blocked at the scene and bus routes have been changed, with drivers being asked not to enter the area.
Riots at Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured
According to the Long Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the riots at the men's maximum security prison.
The riots at the Long Lartin maximum security prison for men in Worcestershire have been ongoing since Sunday morning, starting at about 9:30 a.m.
To quell the riots, which involved eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado task force was called.
The officers suffered minor facial soft tissue injuries and were treated at the scene.
According to a prison official, special trained personnel were called in to help resolve the incident at Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our facility, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their detention may be changed for a longer period.
Long Lartin currently houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison authorities were forced to bring in special units to calm angry inmates who were throwing billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rose could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely gets into the path of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it's "lucky": early next week, Hurricane Rosa, making its final jump, is expected to pass over the desert Southwest and bring with it the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of a threat of torrential flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rose is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and spill rain Monday night.
The National Weather Service office in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967), which made landfall 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest forecast from the National Weather Service is for 5 to 10 inches of rain, with up to 15 inches in places on the Mogollon-Rome plateau in Arizona.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, up to 2.5-5 cm of precipitation is possible, and up to 10 cm in some places.
For areas that will be bypassed by the torrential rains, the rain from Hurricane Rosa could be a blessing, as the region has long suffered from drought.
While torrential flooding can be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the drought that is not happening in the Southwest.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought (second-severity category) ,  reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, with a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta-Euchenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 km/h.
The hurricane has moved into a cooler water zone on the Pacific coast and is losing its strength.
The hurricane will reach Mexico this afternoon as a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some parts of Mexico, with flooding threatening.
From Southern California to northwestern Sonora, up to 7 inches of rain could fall, with up to 25 inches in some places, weather.com reports.
Rose will move north through Mexico and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical cyclone, and from Arizona it will move into southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
The main potential risk from Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is heavy rainfall in Southern California, northwestern Sonora and the desert regions of the southwest United States, the National Weather Service reports.
The rainfall is expected to cause dangerous downpours, mudslides in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Four suspects in the Midsomer Norton attack arrested in connection with attempted murder .
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was stabbed to death, and three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attempted murder was found with serious injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4am on Saturday.
After being hospitalized, his condition is assessed as stable.
Four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area on the same evening, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime who have any video footage of the incident on their cell phones.
Donald Trump: "All the hate, all the rage of the Democrats has fallen on Kavanaugh".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democrats", Trump said at a rally of his fellow Democrats in Wheeling, West Virginia.
In Trump's opinion, the process of nominating Kavanaugh has brought down all the hatred, all the malice, of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress, in an emotional statement categorically rejecting Christina Blaze Ford's accusation that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified at her arraignment.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that it was the day that the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unblemished public service record", the president announced to a crowd of his fellow justices in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president touched on the issue of Kavanaugh's nomination, speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in Congress and the House of Representatives.
We're only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not in them, but I'm in the race in a different way", he said.
I'm running like hell for our top candidates.
Trump believes the Democrats have set themselves the task of "resisting us with all their might".
The first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy is scheduled for Friday, according to an aide to a senior Republican official.
Indonesia earthquake kills hundreds, death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many washed away by giant waves that washed up on the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first casualties were hundreds of guests at a beach festival in the city of Palu, where a six-meter-high wave swept the coast at sunset on Friday, killing many of those present.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach holiday instead of running for shelter immediately and lost their lives,  said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, official of Indonesia's National Disaster Management Authority, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"There were no tsunamis, the water flooded cars, logs, entire houses, the elements destroyed everything in their path", explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its force.
Some of those present climbed trees, saving their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photos of the disaster response department show destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
The coastal city was still shaken by tremors on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a territory with a population of 2.4 million.
A statement by the Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said that the earthquake produced about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected because of the city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage "massive", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that casualties and damage could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Pala, in the town of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter.
Communications from Dungale were completely destroyed, no information was received.
 The Dungala area has over 300,000 inhabitants,  the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, with staff and volunteers already on the way to the disaster zone.
"A tragedy has occurred, but it is not over", the statement said.
On Saturday, the Bureau was heavily criticized for not giving a timely warning of the tsunami in Palu, but authorities believe the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in effect.
An amateur video has appeared on social media showing a man on the top floor of a building screaming about the coming tsunami, desperately trying to get people's attention on the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water falls on the shore, washing away entire houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused major power outages, cutting off communications in Palo, and making rescue operations difficult.
Military transport planes have been dispatched from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian aid, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, government sources say.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision volunteers arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where staff found shelter in canvas tents in the courtyard of their office building, and Doseba Sinai said they saw a horrific picture of complete destruction on the way.
"They saw a lot of destroyed houses", he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have started to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that international NGOs have not been able to reach Pala.
Indonesian law only allows foreign organizations to attract funding, humanitarian aid and staff after a disaster has been declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
It is believed to be a local disaster,  said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government declares a national disaster, we can accept foreign aid, but for now the status remains unchanged".
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Pala, friends and relatives of the missing are still hoping for a miraculous rescue that will restore hope to the population.
A little boy was rescued Saturday from a sewer hatch.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble who had been there for two days, near her mother's lifeless body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has been training two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I'm not the last man standing in this sport, and emotionally it's hard to deal with", he said.
Hendon recalls how, after learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel from other paragliders, he spent the next few hours desperately trying to get in touch via WhatsApp with his fellow Paluans who were vacationing at a beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray checkmark, not two blue ones.
"It means that the messages were not delivered", he says.
A brazen theft of $26,750 from an ATM in Newport-on-Livie .
On Friday morning, $26,750 was stolen from Brink's, an ATM operator in Newport-on-Livie, according to a news release from Newport Police.
According to Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minivan was taking cash from an ATM at the amusement park and was about to fill it with new bills.
At this time, a man ran up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of cash to fill the ATM.
Witnesses reported several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many were involved.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Twitter on Saturday: "Personality, formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long used the alias and even used it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news comes ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will co-host the show in place of Ariana, who canceled her appearance due to "emotional issues", according to the show's creator.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also carries religious meaning.
Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ty, вы, , so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us.
First there was Kanye, which means "the only one", and now I'm just Ye, which is the reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to understand who we are.
Kanye is not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pee Dee Dee or just Dee Dee, asked this year to call himself Love or Braza Love.
West's fellow rapper Jay-Z also changed the spelling of his name several times: with and without a hyphen, uppercase or lowercase.
The President of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador vowed "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
On this site, on October 2, 1968, during a peaceful student demonstration, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into the criminal world.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for AI development.
China and its efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) should not be underestimated  The US should double its investment in its research, says Li Kaifu, an AI investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier, several US ministries have made statements about working on AI, although the US as a whole does not have a clear strategy for AI development.
At the same time, China unveiled its own plan last year: to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in AI", says Li.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book "Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest-ranking player in American Othello, and then he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee mentioned previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with unconventional thinking.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
It's not China that's taking academic leaders, it's corporations, Lee believes.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university luminaries to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee believes that changing immigration policies can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence", he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to scientists similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced it was investing $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in this direction for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a long-running dispute with Greece that has blocked its applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Georgy Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was: Do you support NATO and EU membership if a treaty with Greece is accepted?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay the price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, a Skopje resident.
A sufficient number of MPs have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it decisive, even though it is not legally binding.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The State Election Commission said that as of 13:00 there were no reports of violations.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", says 62-year-old Yosse Taniewski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko vote in a referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, paving the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament building in Skopje, setting up chairs in front of tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with our heads held high, not by crawling on the threshold of the officials' offices", Kavadarkov says.
"Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-worth.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be "the key to our prosperous future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, but that is below the required turnout.
A separate poll by the Macedonian Telecom-TV showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those say they'll vote yes.
For the referendum to take place, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City bypasses Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling dealt a blow to Brighton's defence, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored in the 65th minute, it seemed like he had no problem.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He slid between three Brighton defenders before breaking out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green shirts.
He passed one defender and passed several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then passed the ball to Sterling from the left.
The English striker, in the penalty area, returned Aguero's ball in one touch, which drilled right-footed into goalkeeper Matthew Ryan's right corner.
Aguero has some sort of leg problem, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their initial lead in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero got the ball from deep in Brighton.
He threw a perfect left-footer pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before handing Sterling the pass to the long reel.
The Sky Blue forward scored the ball into the goal just before he went out of bounds.
Manchester City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Nekar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is going to take the points away from the Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to rush things.
But tireless Scherzer is hoping to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, start to struggle in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already clinched at least a seventh or eighth seed, but they still hope to secure a division title.
And while we're playing it cool, at least we can hold our ground, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the fans and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How could I miss this?
The Nationals have not yet named a pitcher for Sunday, but the latest reports suggest they're inclined to put Scherzer in the role.
Scherzer, who is about to go to his 34th game, pitched Thursday on the pitching court, and on Sunday, his day off, he's going to pitch.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running in West Virginia .
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, the president's nominee for the Supreme Court.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, although I'm really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we see the mean and the disgusting.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, which is what they want -- power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he argues, have set themselves the goal of "resisting and obstructing".
"And you've seen that for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "evil, mean, nasty and lying".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused loud cheers from the room.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the contents of this document?
Um... um... what document?
No, no, body language betrayed her, I've never seen body language so much as disprove words.
The Labour Party is no longer an organisation with a different view.
She has no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a no-confidence vote against me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour MP who has not been told that we are not welcome to speak our mind.
I have a similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn by a vote of no confidence.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe -- ironically, these are issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting notice on Friday said we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were just like that.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with those many meetings, and the promise of a "more humane and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that there is no difference of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more apparent, and each opinion is evaluated on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues whose political outlook I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with  whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I make a public speech - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a barrage of insults on social media calling for the election to be annulled, condemning the policies of the Centre, or saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments about me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a barrage of sexual and racist attacks every day, but never back down.
What's most disappointing about this policy is that so many insults have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the "broad church", and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of the election, a party is already there.
Over the last two years, I've had a lot of advice to sit down and talk a little less, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, as a schoolboy outraged by the Thatcher government's disdain that literally broke up my school class, I have been committed to advocating for the highest standard of public services for those who need them most -- whether it's the job of a local MP or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, nor did I in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is so hard pressed to get to Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and public damage, and I don't understand the willingness of some to waste their time and energy on questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of election results being overturned or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I deem necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for the constituency of Nottingham East
Er 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Er comes in first place
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that the ER deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennant Premier League match.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was all thanks to their excellent defense and their ability to pick the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Mercy every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested all this time and we are still unbeatable, so I have no reason to be sad", Peter Merchy commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth giving credit to ER, they tried harder than we did".
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, by Fraser Klimo, took the lead, but a yellow card for Warriors' Scottish player Rory Hughes gave Melrose the lead and Jason Baggott grabbed the uncapped try.
Klimo increased the gap to the penalty spot before, right in the middle of the game, scoring a point, and then in the break he made a solitary try, making the score 17-5 in favour of Er.
But the Melrose started the second half well, and a Patrick Anderson shot by Baggott cut the gap to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who received a stretch, and after re-entering, Er moved on thanks to a try by Stafford McDowell, implemented by Klimo.
The current captain of the team, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and the Melrose again had to pay for the failure of Bruce Colvin's attempt at the end of the period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts came back, and when Strawan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind the attacking mole Er.
Klimo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the very repeat exit, after Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong and sent out the end striker Gregor Henry on the home team's fifth attempt.
The Still Game star is about to start a new career in the restaurant business .
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to start working in the hotel industry: it has been revealed that he has been appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he also writes and stars in alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the show's last, and it seems that Kearnan is planning a life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kearnan was planning to take part in a "thriving restaurant business" in Glasgow.
Our Sea: landlocked Bolivia hopes court reopens way to Pacific Ocean
Sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flown over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right".
It's our duty to bring him back.
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict over resources is still alive and eager to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the boldest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has energy, unity and a sense of balance and, of course, they are waiting for a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to back Bolivia's claim that after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia who is fighting a difficult re-election battle next year, is also eagerly awaiting a decision to be made on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he claimed in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will make little difference.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already said it will not influence the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision came only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was "not complicated", says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, the Bolivian case has not been moving forward, but rather has been delayed.
"The current administration in Bolivia has exploited the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes", says Zarate.
According to her, Morales' bellicose rhetoric has destroyed the last of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to have discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court's decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements for the mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the naval issue as a political trump card.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he said.
The court's decision is an opportunity to prove once again that we need to step beyond our past.
North Korea says it won't denuclearize until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go nuclear unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of their countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slowly returns to a path of deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri argues that the dream that prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes substantial steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show is showcasing the latest line of massive headgear that promises to be sold in bulk and worn right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or to completely protect yourself from the sun, there's no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a slew of unusual headwear that are part of their SS19 collection and dazzled visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely unpractical hats have gained popularity among Instagram followers, and designers have decided to put their stunning creations on the catwalk.
A unique example of Valentino: a beige headpiece decorated with wide feather-like fields was painted on the models' heads.
Other massive accessories included watermelons decorated with precious stones, a wizard's hat and even pineapples, but all these headgear were not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of fancy masks, which was very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had a mouthpiece sewn over them, and they looked more like a portrait of Hannibal Lecter than a couture creation.
One of the samples was a tube-and-glasses underwater swimming kit, and the other was a melted ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of making it into the mass market  right at you.
The huge hats follow the heels of La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The iconic label that produced this highly impractical hat, which has become so popular on social media, has created and sent out another huge accessory on the catwalk  a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model herself carrying the bag.
An orange burnt-out raffin bag with a white leather handle and raffin fringe became the highlight of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will be on sale next summer, and with the designer having made such a splash with his work, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories".
John Edward: Language is of great importance to the citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools continue the tradition of excellence in education, which was confirmed once again in 2018 with outstanding test scores demonstrating individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other socially relevant disciplines.
The schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which has over 30,000 pupils across Scotland and is committed to providing the highest standards of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their status as world citizens.
As part of the education sector that is responsible for designing and implementing individual school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are appealing to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you are speaking to his heart.
This is a powerful demonstration that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with citizens of other countries.
In the last exams this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league table and have the highest test scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade of A.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored A in Mandarin (a dialect of Chinese), while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also scored A.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly seen as vital for children and young people in the future.
Today, language subjects are as in demand as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers had difficulty filling job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly becoming a key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession a student chooses, learning a second language will give him a real advantage in the future, as he will have another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to sustain a conversation, with French being the only language with a double-digit percentage  spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That's why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
There is a fairly wide variation in the languages taught in schools in Scotland  each school has its own set of languages.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in light of the country's future development to 2020  such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teachers who are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating learning environments that prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what their future holds.
It is now undeniable that in a global business environment, languages are still vital to the future development of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and benefits to Scotland's young people.
You gotta do it right.
John Edwards, Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego .
The long wait for fans to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we're still waiting to see how much time he has to make up.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six preseason games in the Lakers schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the season", replies the player.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to win support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 pm Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at a hearing this week on the nomination of his nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for the Supreme Court, a nomination that has drawn a backlash since Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual harassment and a Senate vote that was scheduled to be held this week will be delayed by up to a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans who are running in the November election get ahead of the campaign.
President Trump's campaign is thus aiming to see these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help to "activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House", Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible as we enter a hectic campaign season", said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named, Reuters reported.
The event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump's visit to West Virginia this Saturday is his second visit to the state in the last month, as he has gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the polls.
"The fact that the president has to come in for Morrissey to start out ahead of his polling rivals is a bad sign for Morrissey himself", says Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University (quoted by Reuters).
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows readiness and hope as they head to pair on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transitional initiative  is an exceptional, fictional sporting concept, but it is what the players believe in, and it is particularly evident in competitions like this.
So who's got the initiative?
"They had a six-point lead, now they have four, so I guess it's a little bit of a move for us", Jordan Speight said as he left.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead, and 12 more to go.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel the wind in their sails, and they have reasons to keep their spirits up, not least because of the form Spit and Justin Thomas have been playing with all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleep was steady from ti to grin, as his personal example showed.
The victory cheers grew louder as his round went on, driving the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas were down two to two.
His shot that gave them the game-winning shot on the 15th hole was met with similar applause, one that speaks to his belief in a chance for the American team.
"You have to put your whole body together and focus on your game", Spit said.
That's all the players have left.
Go 18 holes and be the winner.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly made Ryder Cup history.
A strange but charming couple from Europe, they've got four out of four, and they don't seem to know mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple not to score a goddess on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided goddess on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
This series and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the furious fans, reinforces the belief that they will not be beaten on Sunday and when the sun goes down behind the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player to secure a potential European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both in different holes at the same time.
But it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took out Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Boggs and the two double-gods on the first nine holes dug a hole for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they never came out.
So no one's gonna help you out of your hole on Sunday.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball and four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they exchange that they deliberately withhold, and how strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has made a significant breakthrough on the final day, but this four-man session also showed that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight back, which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup , Europe leads 10-6 .
Europe will have a clear advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's four-ball and four-way matches ended with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari duo led the fight with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, eager to reclaim the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the mistaken American team in the morning four-ball game, winning 3-1.
The U.S. put up more of a fight in the fourth quarter, winning two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed by four balls, they then teamed up brilliantly to defeat the dispirited Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who had two games on Saturday, showed periodic flashes, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games to four goals and four assists for seven straight.
Justin Rose, resting before the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the fourth, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka 2-1, the world's number one and number three.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk on a refreshing day to the southwest of Paris.
The two points earned by three-time champions Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas on Saturday were a benchmark for the Americans.
They earned a decisive 2/1 win over Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and returned later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come out of a four-point gap, going out on their own, given that the hosts, as Ferrick's team, needed to play a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, Sunday's counterattack looks like it's beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are fueling mistrust of the United States and that his country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "substantial goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and pledging not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles and develop nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing a symmetrical response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there can be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally take the lead in disarmament".
While Ri echoed North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; at that time Kim promised to begin moving towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists that "denuclearization must be done first" and increases pressure through sanctions to force its way through, even objecting to "declaring the war over", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream for people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are reinforcing our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If South Korea, not the United States, had been on the side of this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a deadlock".
However, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile attack on the US mainland was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he was not setting a timeline for the process: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should give Pyongyang a boost for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be active and binding until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization".
The Security Council has been unanimously tightening sanctions on North Korea since 2006, seeking to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and announced after the meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea denounced him for "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was talking about were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to relax in special courses .
A new course introduced this year at Harvard University helped all elementary school students learn to sleep more and to combat the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine consumption to stay awake through the night.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a clinical specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was inspired to introduce such a course, preliminarily presenting a paper on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'I'm sorry I only found out about this when I'm about to graduate.'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me - he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered to students for the first time this year, explores how a healthy sleeping habit contributes to academic and athletic performance and how it improves overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Health Service, says the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, and students complete a series of interactive tasks.
One of the sections of the class features a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines, and books to learn how each of these activities and substances - coffee, light, and sleep deprivation - affect athletic performance and how important it is to get enough sleep each day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages course participants to reflect on their daily lives.
We realize that these classes won't change students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know, as any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health", added Professor Chesler.
He says the false sense of pride that one can "walk all night" is still quite common, and modern technology, as well as the increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He says that getting enough good quality sleep is a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a fasting state, causing it to feel hungry all the time.
Raymond Seo, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop the course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread the word across campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students set an alarm clock to warn them when to go to bed and when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which disrupt the human biorhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng's goal brings the win over Gerrard's team
Rangers suffered another disappointing away game as Dolly Meng's goal led Steven Gerrard's untied team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Aybrooks' team had hoped to win their first away game since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side suffered only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind, with an easy win over Harts, the Scottish Premier League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers, who had lost their spirit, didn't seem to want to even the score.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston have moved up to third, trailing only Hibernian in goals scored.
And the Rangers could be in for a bit of trouble after linebacker Callum Spence had to heal a head wound after an object was thrown from the visitors' sector.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in the team that went through to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same strategy as Livy 11, which increased the gap with Hartz last week, and he would have been happy to see his well-coached lineup squeeze the opponents in every turn.
The Rangers may have been leading in sword possession, but the Livingstons were pushing a lot harder when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes when Menger's first pass to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage.
Keegan Jacobs hit a penalty to team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to only send the ball towards the away bat.
The Rangers were in control, but in the last third, it seemed there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident he should have hit a 45th-minute penalty when he and Stephen Lawless faced off, but referee Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
Rangers had just two hits in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned with Lassan Kulibaly's head kick and a weak Ovi Edgario.
Although Livy's first goal in the 34th minute may not have been the match, no one can deny that they earned it solely through their own efforts.
But again, the Rangers failed to take Jacobs' game from the standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who struggled to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard started to act in the break when he replaced Kulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the substitution almost immediately paid off when the end-half passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But the Livingstons kept bringing the guests into their own game of Lithgow and Halkett, making long passes all the time.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Lithgow passed from the corner of the field.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty after he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the Sunday morning page of our almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity  an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, the Geiger counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Coronado Bell, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the seemingly unlike scientists in the lead roles:
Man: What is that thing?
It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.
Now you can hear it!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days short of his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see abnormal cells .
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see abnormally growing cells and kill them .
Part of the vaccine's therapeutic effect is to train the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in a laboratory setting .
As a result of this change, the cells get the ability to see the type of protein that is common to many cancers, and then the cells have to be re-injected.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
In one patient who received this vaccine and whose immune system learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory setting, after which the altered cells can "see" the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then the altered cells are re-injected into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says, "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine".
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 "stimulates the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
A similar technique has been successfully used in the treatment of leukemia, which involves taking immune cells from patients and training them on how to target cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It went badly.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a concert on Saturday, where he spoke in defense of US President Donald Trump, claiming he would re-take office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", which he wore a "Make America Great Again" hat to, the singer made a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
I talk to white people a lot, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump when he's a racist?"
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", the singer said.
SNL made a parody show starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christina Blasey Ford's sexual harassment claims.
The crowd was not shown on television, but the video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if the Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his hat was being ridiculed backstage.
They were making fun of me backstage.
They say you don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, "And they said my position wasn't cool".
West goes on, "You want to know what's not cool? Wear a Superman cape so no one can tell you what to do.
Then you need love.
His comments at least twice caught the audience's attention, SNL cast members seemed confused, and one person told the publication, "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candice Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest men: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE MANY".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
However, I do not want to support anyone (by buying their music, clothes or otherwise supporting their art) who I believe shares and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
"So are we", she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg originally had the name Snoop Lion, and another example is of course the recently legendary artist Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and then to the artist's name, formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is attacking toxic masculinity .
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as sword wielding John Snow in the HBO horror-fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor recently sharply criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such characters often instill in young people the idea that to be respected, you have to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he felt "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" co-star Rose Leslie, a woman his age, admitted that he was "not indifferent" to the problem.
"I personally take this question rather seriously: Where did we go wrong with our perception of masculinity?"
Why do we teach our kids growing up that we have this problem today?
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge in toxic masculinity due to overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it about the media and the streets that makes young men feel that they should only display one particular aspect of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change this?
Because there's something really wrong with young people today.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ended next summer, stating that he was "done with the battles and the horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's reboot True West, which follows the film's producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
"I met my wife on the show, so he gave me my family and my future", the actor says.
Rose played the Game of Thrones character Keith John Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at their family estate Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country have these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, suggesting a change in the patterns of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, this approach has brought HIV infections to near zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, transmission of disease is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of information on the fault of Republican senators, complaining of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that one of her staffers posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims the lawsuits were fabricated by far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more vile lies", Waters tweeted.
The information released reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, of Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and released information about Waters' employees, Hill reports.
"This unfounded claim is completely false", Waters says.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent activities was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete lie.
Waters' statement prompted immediate criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial", writes Fleischer.
It means the author has a temperament not suited to congressional work.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why get angry?
And you don't have to make excuses.
And you shouldn't go looking for the prosecutors' motives.
You have to stay calm and cool.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very important", he writes.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement of the fraudulent activity.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found", she writes, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees".
Johnny English strikes again, a faint parody of the spy Rowan Atkinson.
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that features Britain in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise Agent Johnny English, which began production back in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film Agent Johnny English: Reboot.
Will the self-deprecating "Obviously we're all shit" painting become another attempt at national export?
Anyway, the rubber-faced, bulging-eyed, profane Johnny English has won his right to chaos for a second time  his name is the most obvious hint that he is a big screen comic for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his fancy claims of glamorous smooch, got a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean features and a portion of this guy who contributed a single note to the tune of Chariots of Fire in London 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, the character was based on the traveler and mysterious international Atkinson, who had once starred in the now-forgotten television advert Barclaycard, in which the character leaves behind a complete chaos.
There's one or two nice moments in this latest issue of JE.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the blades are crawling down his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift for physically performing comedic scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and oddly redundant, especially since such "serious" film rehearsals as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible" now confidently offer comedy as an element.
I feel like humor is for kids, not adults, and I find Johnny English's whimsical misadventures less inventive and relevant than Atkinson's pranks in the Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all the British agents on the ground, much to the horror of agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately has an occasional role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and pushy figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can for the quasi-Theresa May character, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to pull someone out.
And here comes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who is now a schoolteacher at some high-end institution, but also gives informal lessons in covert ops: there are some good jokes here, because English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of rok.
English returns back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his formerly unlucky buddy Buffy, again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, subordinate to the commander of a submarine  the role of a "fun hockey stick" in which Vicky Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because of some terrible mistakes in Her Majesty's Secret Service, and they are faced with the beautiful, fateful woman Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems  the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Buffy begin their odyssey of farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves onto a luxury yacht owned by Walt; English generates a complete anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality headset to explore the interior of Walt's house.
All these scenes, of course, are all sweet and silly fiction, but there's something very childish about it.
It's a moderate thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matched his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan to reduce the British workweek to four days for five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give away the savings made by the AI revolution to their employees by giving them extra time off.
This would allow employees to enjoy three days off for the same pay.
Sources said the idea "fits" into the party's economic agenda and will help the country's population side with the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions has approved a four-day workweek so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is our goal, which is consistent with the Party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in favour of workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this is not currently supported by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to articulate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from the "faceless directors" and "speculators" of the utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current waterworks shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government can make "deductions" based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private sector firms' capital to workers who would be able to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for chief justice for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could prompt any Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham to see if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I told you I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
I called him after it happened, when this information came up, I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was firm, definite, and unequivocal.
But Graham's vote was unwavering.
"I'm firmly committed to Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by an argument with dynamite as its force", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing for sure: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
This story's been going on for 36 years.
And I didn't see anything new in her.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival  is an annual music event featuring an impressive all-star cast with an equally impressive mission  to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Citizens of the World Festival draws tens of thousands of people to the large lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to talk about the event's real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of a global anti-poverty project by an international group of human rights defenders that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or email a world leader, make a phone call, or do any other meaningful action to help raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the World Citizens Festival been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert attendance really convincing citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "collectivism" where people believe they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen organizers say that since 2011, the festival has seen more than 19 million registered actions by supporters who pursue a variety of causes.
The report notes that through these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has announced 390 commitments and announcements that have been made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds have directly benefited nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a UK partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to helping children reach their full potential pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the region, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens participants.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about malnutrition a thing of the past", said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the 'Power of Nutrition' project, which will reach 5 million women and children through actions designed to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the festival's website: Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global citizen responds: "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moné are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could use blockade to prevent Russian energy exports: Interior Minister
US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe", he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability to work with our navy to keep the sea lanes open and blockade them if necessary to keep their energy out of the market", the minister said.
Zinke addressed the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He then compares Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
The economic strategy of Iran and Russia  is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,  says the minister, calling Russia  a pony with one trick, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration set a goal of increasing its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which should double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"When a third country interferes in our energy supply, it creates a serious problem", Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will be closely considering running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top", Warren told The Hill.
After November 6th, I will be considering a run for president.
Warren said President Donald Trump's actions during the meeting "lead this district in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to my core about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course we need to have an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "likely" voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The poll showed that the population is more supportive of former governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent support his possible participation in the election, while 48 percent are against it.
Other prominent Democratic names that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump voters.
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the Army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"My son, who has come home, is now experiencing the same thing as other families who have suffered from PTSD and have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries", she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a slap in the face and said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back hardened, wondering if their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military are being treated with the same respect they have shown their country".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman by getting involved in a violent situation and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims of runaway or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a court adviser's analytical note in Washington on Friday supporting an asylum seeker challenging the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the suit Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not being released.
The woman claims that her civilian husband and his sons, who belong to a criminal group, mistreated her, but on July 20, US officials rejected her asylum request.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing high numbers of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates that principle", the legal counsel said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country is hurting the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
"Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never intended to solve all the problems, even the most serious problems, that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very difficult right now", says 35-year-old mother Reza Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulance is bringing in injured people every minute.
Clean water is in great short supply.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig through wet things and try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude quake are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwy Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near the Palau Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the premises due to the continuing strong tremors.
He cries as he recalls how a powerful earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor that he rented with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save.
I think I was squeezed into the debris", Harris told The Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're safe and sound now.
US Ambassador accuses China of "attacks" carried out through "propaganda advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper, as a paid supplement, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a confirmation of what US officials told Reuters: a new phase in Washington's intensifying campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, with them equalizing tariffs on their countries' imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, argues that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an article published in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "is now doubling down on this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of our cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by paying for and placing ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
But in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices or see the true diversity of opinions that Chinese people can experience when they learn about China's troubling economic policies, because local media are under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party, he writes.
He also added that one of China's most prominent newspapers, lovko, had withdrawn from the offer to publish his article, though he did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: Republicans are pushing away women voters with Kavanaugh 's spanking on the eve of the midterm elections .
Many senior Republicans have chosen to stay away and support Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy despite several allegations of sexual assault, which analysts warn is a backlash, especially from women, that could affect the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the situation have been heated to extremes, and most Republicans have officially said they want to continue the vote.
"These are things that can't be returned", says Grant Rier, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) last-minute attempt to conduct an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, they will not forget in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November on!" outside the Senate as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the bounds", said nonpartisan political scientist Stu Rothenberg on a news website.
People say things are getting pretty bad, and they are.
But things can get worse, especially for women voters in the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Court nominee, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts speculated that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could spark a backlash.
"It's already a mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, but how Republicans are handling it, how they're treating her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe - Ford or Kavanaugh - and are leaning slightly more toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents either believe Ford's testimony or are likely to believe it, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh's testimony or are likely to believe it.
Additionally, 38 percent believe Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser  Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that's competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he says of his startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own personal online data warehouses or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, business, as well as a calendar, music library, and other personal and professional data tools.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify  all can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data store is that it is completely user-managed, which can access any information it needs.
The company calls this principle "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers with whom it has a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make sweeping changes that would completely change their entire business model overnight.
We're not asking them for permission.
In his Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial power and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate over net neutrality.
Even if he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era", says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Church official, awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one priest-warrior was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglish and Leucore.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received Britain's highest military award.
A monument to the event was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Cant's Canal in a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he threw himself into the line of fire and with "great courage" led the group forward, then with one hand threw a field gun, shooting down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918  just over a month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said he was unlikely to have acted as heroically, but it was comforting.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid wreaths at the end of the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for me to be part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be shown by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 but instead they were shown Peppa Pig.
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch the full Bellator 206 but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San Jose schedule featured 13 fights, including six main schedule fights, broadcast live all night on Channel 5 UK.
At 6am, as Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald prepared for the match, UK fans were stunned to see Peppa Pig on the screens.
Some fans were not impressed, for they stayed up until the morning to watch the fight.
One fan on Twitter called the change to a children's cartoon "a sick joke".
"The state has issued a decree that says that content is inappropriate for 6am, so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why.
Yes, Peppa Pig, you are.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they plan to schedule the fight in a way that future UK viewers can also watch.
"As for the re-shows, I think we can solve this", says Coker.
But it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't solve this until Sunday, our time, and for them it's already Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there were a bunch of text messages, and they were all far from friendly.
We tried to fix it right away, thinking it was some kind of technical glitch.
Turns out it wasn't, it was a matter of state concern.
I promise, it won't happen again.
We're gonna reduce the number of fights to five instead of six as we normally do, and for the fans, we're trying to increase that number, but it's too much.
Yeah, it didn't work out so well.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation .
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first ever Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics became less of a concern after he had a child.
The longtime host of the show Kirsty Young took a few months off due to illness.
Daly, who was the main guest on Laverne's show, said he felt "less than anyone else in my age group" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both boys and girls.
He says: "Until now, these feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy have been very real, but they have given me strength and have helped me to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something" so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and in a speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said his feelings for a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised him".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that age difference has never been a problem.
If so much happens in your life at such a young age, he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find a peer who has had the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal", the athlete says.
But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept that he was dying and one of his last requests was front row tickets to the 2012 London Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be around and you can't sit in the front row,'" says Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", says the athlete.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming about all my life - diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song  Proud by Heather Small  which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still does.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 BST. This is the first time I've heard of this.
Mickelson, out of shape, spent Saturday on the Ryder Cup bench.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to tighten up his form to avoid a nasty milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennale for a record 12th time, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for four balls and four fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as is often the case in the United States, the five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what was bothering him.
Never having possessed the most direct shot, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal candidate for the hard Le Golf National, where the long raft usually penalizes for inaccurate shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have lost by four points in 12 singles, get off to a strong start, Mickelson's match could be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though what else could he say.
"He fully understood the role he was given today, and he patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Ferik said.
He's pretty sure of himself, too.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's done so much for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Foldo's record for most Ryder Cup games.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferrick said his presence has brought the team considerable benefit.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to pick on people, and he's a great guy to be with", he explained.
I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to watch.
His game is much more than a game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage could soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead in the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into a disadvantage.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderram, where the team led by Severjan Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line just a little ahead with the smallest difference, winning with a score of 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only for now", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018, winning at Le Golf National 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday, giving the score 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the entire team that this is not the end.
You'll be on your best day tomorrow.
Go and do it right.
Until the points are on the board, nothing is over.
We have a goal, and that's a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I was talking about the 12 players on our team, but we know exactly what we're up against.
Pleased with his players' performance on a golf course that was uncomfortable for them, Bjorn added: "I would never have surpassed myself in that.
We have another test tomorrow.
The one-man shows start tomorrow, and that's a whole other thing.
It's always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're just trying your hand at golf.
That's what you need to instill in the players so that they can play hard tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind, and he has to do his best too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will perform better individually than with partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points out of four.
Ferrick himself has been through this whole carousel of the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ultimately losing when Europe performed the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word about it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, rallied his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to get it over with, like Brooklyn, like Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've got our game plan in place and we've got the guys set up the way we thought was right, okay?
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance, meeting Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
"I chose this group of guys, and in this order, because I think they will cover all the possible shortcomings", Bjorn said, commenting on his selection of individual players.
The commissioning of Germany 's new warship has been postponed again .
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it won't happen at least next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost increases, local media reports.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reports, citing a military official.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods  the ability to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant delay in commissioning means that the most advanced warships that are said to allow Germany to expand its power abroad will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless in combat.
The software deficiencies were particularly critical as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors  only half the manpower on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to implement upgrades in the future.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping the latest frigates at anchor are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings about the decline of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "de facto running out of ships capable of deployment".
The official said that the problem had worsened over time because the old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been taken into service by the navy.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret lives of bats .
A new study at a farmhouse in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
Hopefully, the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique winged mammals and help in future conservation efforts.
The study, organised by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will examine the common bats, the soprano bats, and the brown long-haired bats and Dobanton night herons, which inhabit Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys of the area using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the cries as well as the activities that the different groups of these animals are responsible for.
Then a habitat map will be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes these results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify major areas of habitat management, such as grassland development, and ways to maintain forest areas in optimal conditions for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect their habitat and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can be dangerous, as can tape for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, and hunting of domestic cats.
Bat is not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to pinpoint obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which oversees more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat populations very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, field inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, it's a great place for bats", he says.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He reminds us of the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance on private property, since the accidental destruction of a single nest can result in the death of up to 400 females and young, and possibly even the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, and killing, harassing or destroying their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's officer of the Bat Foundation, is calling for public assistance.
She says: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their individual species live".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape charges against him, calling them "fake news" and claiming that people just "want to make a name for themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel for publishing the charges against the footballer.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga, allegedly in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to speak about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video that has 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the news "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they've told us today is all fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They just want to make a name for themselves using my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
"I'm a happy man, and everything is going great", the athlete adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for what they say is "unacceptable information about suspected privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player intends to claim compensation for "moral damage in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal fashion, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was 99 percent a good guy, but one percent consistent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she contacted the police and had her injuries photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fearful of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to move because she continues to experience traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was due to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'regrets carmakers lost for good'
Business and Entrepreneurship Secretary Greg Clark said Britain would "regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He also commented on reports that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", says Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker has said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The Bernaston plant produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped", says Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to carmakers, if there is no Brexit deal, supply chains will be put at great risk.
Toyota's production line is running on time, and parts for custom-built cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and spare parts shortages.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store supplies at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU, announced at Chequers, was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We want a better deal that will allow us, I repeat, not only to succeed now, but to take advantage of this opportunity in the future", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are saying that we should be able to maintain successful supply chains".
Toyota was unable to specify for how long the production would be halted, but in the longer term, it warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory union, says the concern among the union members is growing: "In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can't get them back".
A government spokesman says: We have developed a clear and robust plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller's work investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a matter of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using wires to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies that information.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House supposedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, on Thursday.
Trump said he "would have preferred not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints about Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "The date of this meeting has not yet been set, it may be this week, and it may be postponed for another week given all the other developments in the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings is not due to "contempt for the community" of television reporters, though she added: "I won't deny they play in public".
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"The president has more meetings with journalists than any president before him", she added, without giving exact figures.
Sanders assured me that the briefings would continue, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions from outside the White House, participating in public meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Press conferences are rare.
The president's frivolous and sometimes bizarre behavior in front of a gathering of reporters in New York this week may be the answer to why.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter about concerns over Brexit
The Minister of Health has addressed EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express his gratitude on behalf of the whole country and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to staff less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applying for status for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "The UK and EU have been negotiating on the withdrawal issue for the summer and an expected decision is due this autumn.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
So right now, I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie had emergency surgery for a head injury .
Michael Organ of Tennessee reports that Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He went to the sideline and just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to the hospital for a medical examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "we don't have any details yet on the type/degree of injury" and Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, a sophomore, it was his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before being sent off, he successfully intercepted five goals, making 18 goals in a season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
This move would nullify Corbyn 's efforts to attract young voters .
An increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay UK tax
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless  Theresa May will announce today.
The move would undermine Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters who promise to make housing more affordable and raise incomes.
The higher stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms not paying UK tax, and the additional funds raised should stimulate the government's efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surcharge on the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago on secondary and rental housing, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London properties are bought by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to improve their living conditions later.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country after buying a home here.
The new policy was developed weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of driving up property prices by buying land but not actually using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix Britain's "disgraceful housing situation".
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include controlling rent and ending unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better for each new generation.
And that means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that for non-UK citizens, as well as for foreign companies, buying property is as affordable as for hardworking Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the threat of being on the street is too real for some.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying a resurgence at the north-eastern club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points clear of the Championship.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the B hat, and that's it", Ross told BBC Sportsound Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland as a child with my father in Hampden, and it always drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers have also included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not afraid of such high-profile names at such big clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
"By its structure and capabilities, this club definitely belongs in the Premier League", says the coach.
Getting him out there is not an easy task, but I will consider myself successful only if I can get the club back.
Ross has been in charge for just three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from the third tier and the following season led St Mirren from bottom to championship winners.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable today than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
I honestly believed that management was more my thing than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did everything right, I made good money in this job, and I had some success.
But the game of  is more difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still under a lot of stress and pressure at work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I feel most comfortable doing it, like a fish in water, in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 BST.
According to the poll, 5:30 p.m. is the perfect time for a pint.
The summer heat led to increased sales in British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurants saw sales fall by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consultancy that obtained the statistics, said: "The continued sunshine and longer than expected England's World Cup attendance means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when pubs were up 2.8% and restaurants were down significantly".
The June drop in restaurant sales of 1.8% continued in July.
Pubs and bars that sell alcohol performed much better than restaurants.
Pubs that sell only food were also hit by the sun, though not as badly as restaurants.
It's like people want to jump out just to pass a drink.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars rose 6.6% in the month, and food  by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hotel analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain crucial factors when it comes to sales in the non-residential market.
It is no wonder that restaurant chains continue to struggle, especially as a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales will be especially painful because of continued price pressures.
The long hot summer proved to be more difficult than ever for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with its more moderate temperatures, will provide a much-needed respite.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand shrinkage.
Coffer Peach Tracker's industry sales monitoring of the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 chains with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
According to the survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they keep hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found a rise in fake news pages
The news has raised concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account that their parents knew about.
However, one in five children - some as young as 11 - has a social networking account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts, a photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic, "clean" account that their parents had access to, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, came across a teenager who was urging others to "rape" him.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Principals (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two social media accounts, with half admitting that one is usually secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan says: "Many teenagers are looking to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and this is a worrying fact".
Eileen Doyle will be the voice of Scottish athletics .
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics, and chairman Ian Beatty said the move was a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to take advantage of the athlete's extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that her involvement will bring huge benefits to athletics in Scotland", Beatty said.
Doyle says: "I aspire to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has four Olympic gold medals in total and now works as a regular commentator for the BBC, having lost the ability to walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I've lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!
A milk-sucking ad comparing nursing mothers to cows has divided netizens
A company that produces milk pumps caused a controversy online by posting an ad that compared nursing mothers to dairy cows.
In what is being billed as the world's first breast-wearable, silent vacuum, consumer technology company Elvie released a music video to showcase the freedom the new vacuum offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms are dancing in a hayloft to a song that says, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you can't see my tail", and "If you haven't noticed, it's not my hive, it's my breast".
And then the chorus: "We suck, we suck, we breastfeed our babies, we suck, we suck".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversy online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within days of birth, one user wrote.
Elvie's suction cup is worn directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: "Of course, it's equally traumatic for mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise the milk pumps for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another user adds: Advertising detached from reality.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just gorgeous".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was breastfeeding a baby, I'd definitely buy one of these.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but that's kind of how it feels.
A brilliant product, wrote one user.
And another comment: Funny ad for mothers who breastfeed (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and who really feel a little "cow".
This ad is not meant to praise or curse our dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women are shown dancing with these invisible suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept of this ad campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie suction cup is completely imperceptible, has no wires or tubes, fits freely into the breastplate for feeding, and is invisible, allowing women to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, comments: "Elvie's pump is so revolutionary that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring attention to breastfeeding and all its problems, while also showing in a humorous and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that comes with a new suckler.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk sucker has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the runway of designer Marta Yakubovskaya, using the product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children moved freely to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because the tough rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with guardians.
Usually, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants who are afraid to risk their stay in the country by taking custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
About 80 percent of the people who are either guarantors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
"We are continuing to pursue these individuals", said Albens.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of registering children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days as before.
To declare their legal status to an immigration judge, many of them appear via video link rather than in person.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information that has surfaced in the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these problems are heightened in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that sending children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already dealing with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eighth year of war.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the crowd.
Muallem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle" until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Muallem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that have encouraged the refugees to stay outside the country.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the return of the citizens", he says.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has opened the door for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Nusra Front militants affiliated with Al Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes the first meetings of a new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, will be convened soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers are likely hoping.
And this will undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential end in history!
At this point, there's no sign of the audience being tired.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings, garnering 3.5 million viewers on prime-time nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's beyond our understanding", says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama "The Appointed Survivor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a long-running comedy writer and author of Funny or Die: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Breaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, offers a different theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver informed her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Yes, because it's funny!" says Mrs. Scovell.
There's something valuable in all this chaos... fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content on television, Washington's storylines can shape the future of Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of immigrant family reunification and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour in a row, a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" for his book "Fear", or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (a garment covered in a garland of pride, as the Washington Post puts it), or Stormy Daniels' harsh description of, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it's already beyond the realm of common knowledge.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of its job is to make us feel like a reality show is feeding you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing cast and the daily twists and turns of the show (fighting with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 90 degrees on the North Shore of Kaua'i, sunny, but he was hiding inside his house watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't get away from the screen, at least not when they showed Brett Kavanaugh appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke at the time, but they were right.

Outsider money pouring into the most violent midterm election the White House has ever run.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow from changing congressional districts where two officials are in the race for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh suburb, whose geography was recently changed, supports Democrat House member Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps substantially with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally assigned to Republicans as a result of election rigging.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a heated debate over campaign finance between the major party's financial forces  the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became well known in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in a widely-observed March special election to Congress in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which provoked a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, who was also in Panama before the partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Amid regular domestic meetings, the North and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward anyway, and effectively stopped considering El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will feature Vice President Mike Pence as a sign that the administration is taking this meeting seriously.
Three American diplomats have safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which was reported by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who is familiar with the administration, but also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn the history
The next step could be a report from special counsel Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia and its attacks on the election.
If Congress changes ownership, Mr. Trump will face accountability in this body, just as he prepares to speak again to voters, and perhaps eventually to a jury of his peers.
But there are many "ifs"; I don't mean that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is the fall of his European counterparts.
We're all going to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup and overthrow Hitler, and this would happen if the West resisted and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
But we didn't, and we missed the chance to avoid years of bloodshed.
It's at these points that the course of history unfolds, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows.
Americans are going through some of these tipping points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president's activities and argued that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims the Times's report is wrong.
How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or truthful, or if he is confirmed as chief justice despite credible sexual harassment allegations and false testimony?
And first of all, will we in the medium term vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe we can pass them with dignity because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she would take me to light the swastika candles on the table.
With a family history like mine, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eysen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Troubling Century in the Story of Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against the Viennese Rapids.
Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position in Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first start of the season in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve bigger results.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game thinking we could get something, and we left with nothing.
Maybe in the end, we could have done it, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we were better.
This Thursday, another big European night is coming up.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they showed a good performance in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with all the injuries and the substitutions at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The lineup is perfectly selected and the guys really enjoy it; the training was on ura.
I hope we can move forward, put the past season behind us and be successful.
Women are losing sleep over their retirement savings
Although respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in a national survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't try to talk to them about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
And that's where you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for what they may have to do to care for you if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your healthcare provider and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be a major cost factor.
Consult your financial adviser, who can help you to draw up a plan for paying these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed cash life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or you can insure yourself with your own property if you have money.
Put your legal papers in order: save yourself legal battles.
Make a medical certificate and appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are met if you cannot communicate.
We also recommend that you consider a financial power of attorney.
You should choose a trustee who will help you make financial decisions and monitor your bills if you become incapacitated.
Remember the little things too: Suppose your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
If so, can you provide information about the medications he is taking and what his allergies are?
Write down all these details on paper so that you can be properly prepared in case of an emergency.
Martin adds: "It's not just the finances that matter, but the choice of doctors as well".
What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Make and write this plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The failure of communications has prevented rescuers from getting any information from Donggala, a district north of Palau, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu  is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (2017 data).
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala  is a district stretching along 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi, and in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important to the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morawa, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, tsunamis have devastated Palau and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi-Jaya district of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped under the rubble.
Sara Palin 's oldest son is in custody on domestic violence charges .
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence situation and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention and will be released on a $500 bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his "unique innocence".
Paeline faces three Class A misdemeanor counts, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting an alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin came under criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after she explained her son's abusive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, allegedly acquired as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media is showing videos of the incident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutor wants to hand down a rare death sentence to a suspect in a New York terrorist attack .
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people - a rare federal punishment for a crime that hasn't been carried out in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bike lane on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, knocking over pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm, according to a death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of these charges could lead to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "carefully planned and deliberate", and Saipov carried it out, as described, "in a repugnant, brutal and criminal manner".
Sayfulla Habibullayevich Saipov has caused injury, loss and damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco, the notification of intent says.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York prosecutor demanded the death penalty for a felony.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.
The last federal death penalty in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators he was glad he did it.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching an ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He denies all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who is speaking on Saifov's behalf, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the death penalty rather than life in prison without the possibility of parole will only add to the pain of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously petitioned prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the sting" of Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bown said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have "gone out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
However, the problem Ms May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that Tory anti-Brexit members are joining a separate anti-Brexit protest taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, voiced at Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insist she continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to beat the Checkers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be leveled and put in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out of here", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to support Brexit, but we need to beat Chequers".
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bown dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving a comment to reporters: "I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people".
Checker is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also unpopular with our party members and our activists who are actually storming the streets and electing us first.
Please put the Checkerers aside and start listening to what they're saying.
In her sharp address to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers stay on their jobs if they stay on their promises".
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they need to be made to "feel the pressure".
"It's now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he says.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them: We're not going to let this get away from you.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, to feel the sting.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-reliant and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved "Tories against Brexit" banners this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party's mobile app.
"And these people claim they can set up Canada plus plus's IT systems and technology to work across borders, to trade freely without borders with Ireland", he added.
This is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he says.
Warren plans to study his presidential race carefully .
U.S. Congresswoman Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be "carefully exploring the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who was Trump's campaign co-chair in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she has a shot at taking over Trump's post in 2020.
She held another voter meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon; it was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town hall meeting since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to "fix" our broken government, and that would require a woman at the top.
As a result of the murder of Sims (strangled), an LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
At 11:00 a.m. local time, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting asking for help identifying the man who was captured on video.
20-year-old Sims was shot outside the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being involved in the incident, having a weapon with him and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world championship title after team tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a big part in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole position and almost hung on Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettle went to the pit stop first, leaving Hamilton to flip in the back of the pack  a choice that became crucial.
Mercedes went to the pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, broke through, which led to the Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving the interior space free, risking being caught after a double move for protection in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then drove most of the race on his home tyres, aiming to finish quickly, pushing Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually went to pit stop on lap 44, but could not increase pace on the remaining eight laps, as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and was really generous to share it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a few tricks in stock", Hamilton said.
The traitorous sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not release a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were "vile, nasty, and lying people".
"The only possible response to all this and what's been happening in the last few days in the Senate is beautiful, it's anger, it's anger, it's disgust and it's lies", he said.
You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you pass on the information?
Remember her answer... did you leak the information from the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't.
Okay, hold it right there.
Did we? No, we didn't, he added with a senator's tone.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the charges Ford had filed against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally leaked, but Feinstein denies the leak occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, but I didn't leak her information", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.
However, the manner in which she denied the leak allegations did not seem to please the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday: "I'll tell you this: body language let her down.
She may not have spat, but her body language was the worst I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend his nominee for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They're definitely trying to regain power by any means necessary.
We see the vile, the disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step through to gain power and control", Mediaite quotes the president as saying.
The British Elite Hockey League is Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the game against Dundee.
In an Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid off Friday's defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the replay on Saturday with a 5-3 victory over Dundee.
The Giants took an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the bar for the home team before Dwyer took the Giants to the lead.
François Bouchard equalised the Dundee side before two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For Adam Keefe's men, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was their third defeat of the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goal pass with David Rutherford's support, after which Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the opening period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney to tie the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the initiative in the first half when he scored the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again tied the score, scoring a goal with 27:37 to their advantage.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured victory, keeping the opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are headed to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant died so that hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he willingly died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing in a massive earthquake on Sulawesi on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to devastate the area, leaving many residents of Palu under the rubble.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the eerily swaying control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, in the city of Palu.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he saw the tower collapsing, he jumped off.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation official Johannes Sirait said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News.
We had a helicopter ready from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter landed in Palu.
"We are very sorry for this loss", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the disaster agency said access to Donggala, Shiga and Butong was restricted.
The death toll is likely to rise as large numbers of people are still under the rubble and many have not been able to get out,  said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 20 feet high devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing in casualties every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
The tragedy is already quite serious, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, saying in particular: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN is here.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now reports one person missing, while it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely off the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it had no information about a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to locate the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline also said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes says the plane came in too low.
"And that's a good thing", says Janez.
Janez said that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane because the water level was at the waist.
He also said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming on board, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped with the rescue, using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank to about 100 feet (30 m).
Flight Safety Network data shows that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in air crashes involving aircraft from companies registered in PNG, but none of these crashes were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst has been able to prove that a woman was burned alive .
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a lawsuit against a man accused of setting fire to a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told department members how he used cell phone records to piece together the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones, which suggested Tellis was spending time with Chambers that night, contradicting his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reports.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but his cell phone was reportedly near Chambers; when it was discovered, police questioned Sanford.
In his statement, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tallis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, the phone records show that they only spoke for one week.
Roulette also revealed that some time after Chambers Tallis' death, he deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale says.
The defense is expected to begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio is going to fight against the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, argues that the content of hip hop has changed away from its original political and social issues.
The band wants to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues married couple over racist text
A New York nanny sued a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny was "another black woman" who she had mistakenly sent to a nanny instead of her husband.
The couple denies being racist, claiming the lawsuit was "extortion".
Lindsay Placebo-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the child care service, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at the family's first day of work in 2016.
"Not only that, but another black woman", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
However, instead of sending the text to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her mistake, the "confused" Placo-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be African-American, was not doing her job well and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, the New York Post reported.
Maurice was paid for one day's work, and then sent home in an Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and demanding compensation for the $350 a day dismissal for six months  under the terms of the original verbal agreement, which, however, was not enshrined in any contract.
"I want them to understand that this is unacceptable", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "And I know it's discrimination".
The couple disagree with the accusation of racism, and say that firing Maurice was a reasonable move because offending her would make them no longer trust her.
My wife texted her something she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racist", the husband, Joe Plateau, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if you were rude to them unintentionally?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on, you guys.
Calling the lawsuit "extortion", Plateau said his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
And you're willing to prosecute a man in that position?
Not very nice of you", added a banker who specializes in investments.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand the talking bear move, a new letter says.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads a book for the first time, even before it's published.
It's funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.
She also said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he decided to write a children's book about the teddy bear, would have been optimistic about refusing publication, adding that the 60th anniversary of his books was "both joyful and bitter" because their author died last year.
As for Paddington the Bear himself, she speaks of him as "a very important member of our family", and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally become famous.
"He was a quiet and modest man", his daughter said.
Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved something: he was proud of it, although he didn't really consider it his own achievement.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid homage to the bear itself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said that things were really bad, that something had gone wrong", says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called again and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that we needed to say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medication that doctors gave her to keep her heart working gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, or scream, or cry, because I was surrounded by other people, other families.
I had to keep my wits about me.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, coming to terms with the enormous loss she had just experienced.
"No one around knew what had happened", she says.
My head went up, I couldn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking that step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers for people to reach out for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to go through what I go through every day", she says.
Davis, 45, of Lidney, says that her son was a great cook and had a very charming smile.
Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like the light in the room was on.
But before he died, he quit because he was going through a really bad time.
It happened in 2014, and Tyler, who had committed suicide, was found by his brother, who was 11 at the time.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know that there's someone you can go to and tell everything, even if it's your friend.
You can't just sit there and be silent. You have to talk to people.
Mrs. Humphries, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed or upset or anything like that", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he was especially sick: he didn't even look at the children when they opened their presents.
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it, it was a devastating event for our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must keep living and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh 's future hangs in the balance , and the FBI is investigating .
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for - an investigation limited in time and scope, we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking up" amid growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their fluctuations.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if - as expected - things go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be the country's chief justice.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for Mr. Cavanaugh, who once worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has declined under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung Seung, citing the southern ministry, said that the number of escapees had dropped to 1,127 last year from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says the key factors are the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers who take people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they reached a general agreement on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of impeding progress on the issue with its sanctions.
"If we don't have the slightest confidence in the United States, we won't have confidence in our national security either, and under such circumstances we can't start disarmament unilaterally", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would be immediately labeled a 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kawano was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and choking, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him "grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an active person" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because of his Democratic bias.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements, and also with the way he's attacking the Clintons and Democrats", she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to prosecute Kavanaugh if he was convicted and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but he's not fit for the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative justice advocate.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh was asked whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time to put a hysterical, prejudiced man on the Supreme Court and shout 'How great!'", Pelosi said.
And women should have that.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, she can't get through it without tears.
"When we are angry, we cry", Miss Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was really helped by a woman who worked in an executive position somewhere, and she said that she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interviewer, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm actually angry".
And then she just kept talking.
I was really impressed with that approach.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they're fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in a male-dominated office was crying in a rage, but I was grabbed by the chin by an elderly woman, a heartless manager I had always been terrified of, and dragged up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they finally got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught having some sort of minor affair and dropped out of the race, and Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president.
"It was a poorly thought-out decision", she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some people called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was coming to a close, and she was very behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed like a completely losing proposition.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men offered her only $250.
"Am I a cheap commodity to them?" she wondered.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she choked.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalls about the press reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they gonna write on my memorial?
She was crying all the time?
How a trade war with America can be good for Beijing
Experts believe the first blasts of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs hit goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has promised to retaliate against the US in equal measure each time, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to experience any difficulties anytime soon.
To make Washington back down is to give in to demands, but to publicly give in to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the US trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a premature political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to an economic deadlock in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security specializing in Asia.
The foreign minister says Syria is ready to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure due to the successes in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there peacefully.
The conditions are now in place for refugees to voluntarily return to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept any kind of aid or assistance from countries that sponsor terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team by a final score of 16.5  10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup hasn't been won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard most of the tournament, made his first long jump into the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the first 1-on-4 player to ever go 5-0-0, since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5-4 by the lowest rated player in the European team, Turbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Jan Polter, who may have been in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's all-time European champion with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself tonight.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the trophy again.
It's all about the team and I'm happy to help", says Garcia, emotional after the European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Rame, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles.
"I feel incredibly proud of this win, because I grew up watching Tiger Woods play", says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3.
That's a pretty strange number for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, trying in vain to excel, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
We managed to get a little bit of a Europe this morning.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great.
We regroup, I work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we move forward, making it a success.
I love all 12 of them, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta know how to lose.
We lost.
Red tide: news Microorganisms have declined in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects a general decline in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, areas in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties are reported to be flourishing, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
Red Tide stretches approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The outbreaks are about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they're down from last week.
Red tide is also in Pasco County.
Last week, there were reports of medium concentrations in and near Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough County coastal area, high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota counties and coastal areas, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations in Lee County coastal area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, there is still a risk of respiratory irritation.
No such possibility was reported in northwest Florida last week.
