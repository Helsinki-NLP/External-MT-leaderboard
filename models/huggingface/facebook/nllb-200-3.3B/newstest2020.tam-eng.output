The President explained the need for specialists in this field to pay special attention to climate change in an era when the cooperation of science, technology and research sectors is needed to overcome the challenges faced by the people of our country.
The President said that the main challenge in the journey towards development is that most people in the field, in science, technology and research think only of themselves and not of the country. He said that it is a big problem that the country is losing the engineers, doctors and accountants needed by the country because the educated people who receive free education have left the country thinking only of themselves and not of the country.
The theme of the exhibition is 'Rich Country with Strong Hands' and is divided into five sections namely Technology Entrepreneurship, Industry, Innovation, Blue Green and Entertainment.
The Technology Sector is organized to promote the knowledge of modern science, technology and research in STEM education, space technology, biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology, mechatronics, new energy, blue green technology, 55G IOT.

The protest was organised by the Secular Progressive Alliance, which condemned the Hindu Front's violent trend and called for swift action by the police in connection with the 28th attack on the institution.
On 5th of December, over 60 members of the Hindu Front broke into the back-logging company at Tirupur Anjaripalayam Road.
The workers were attacked and the company's equipment was damaged.
The police have done little about it.
The protest was announced on 9th of last month by the Tripur Secular Progressive Alliance parties, which condemned the incident and called for a demonstration against the incident.
The complaint was lodged with the District Magistrate and the Municipal Police Commissioner of Thiruvur.
The following consultation was held and a new protest was announced on September 17 by the Secular Progressive Alliance.
The protest against the police department's refusal to allow the demonstration began at 11 am on 17th of last month in the opposite direction of the Tiruppur Municipal Corporation, where the protest was held 'condemning the violent trend of the Hindu Front - demanding the police to take immediate action'.

All party executives including CPI (M) state committee member K. Kamaraj, CPI (M) district secretary S. Muthukanan, CPI (M) district secretary M. Ravi, Congress party party executive M. Ramasamy and M. Sampat participated in the protest.
Police intervened in the middle of the protest, claiming that they were not allowed to protest.
The secular Progressive Alliance party said that on 5th April, Hindupanthan had attacked the Hindustan Institute and caused a riot.
We have formally asked for permission to protest democratically, but the police have not given us permission. We have filed a complaint with the government and the police commission, but the police have refused to allow us to protest, and the importance of the request has been considered a violation of the ban on protesting democratically.
Police have arrested several people in connection with the attack on the laundry.
He further said that the police should take swift action to arrest the Hindu Front Row members involved in the incident.
The protest was attended by more than 500 people, mostly women, who protested against the violence, and the police did not arrest the protesters who broke the ban.
The protest was loudly condemned by the Hindu Front for the attack on the recycling plant in Tirupur and for the various forms of religious violence being perpetrated by the Hindu Front.
It is no wonder that the Orb Patam, a protest by the democratically controlled Dodo and the secular progressive alliance, has raised awareness against violence among the people of Tripura!

"If I do it, people will do it!" Ramsing said of the initiative, "We have seen frustration among people with the difficulties of getting more vegetables, traffic jams, and pollution.
Many people have complained about it but they do not seem to be thinking of an alternative or to realize that they have the solution.
The only real solution is that people will follow me if I do what I believe in.
So once a week, my wife and I walk 10 kilometers to buy vegetables.
It's been going on for six months and now it's become a habit.
I am very satisfied now".
"Many people said that it was difficult to carry a lot of vegetables. I suggested that they carry a basket in the closet to fight the threat of plastic.
But they laughed at him.
So my wife and I took a basket of bamboo and went to the market.
It was then that I realized that it would be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people these days are not in good health.
I think they should start walking and controlling their food.
I am a firm believer that traditional approaches can provide the best solutions to the challenges of innovation in a modernised world.
If one can handle the traditional methods, then one can live with full health", says Ram Singh, IAS, enthusiastically.

The Election Commission has reduced the period of disqualification of convicted Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh from six years to one year and one month.
This has removed the deadlock in the contesting of the by-election in Tamang.
Sikkim Assembly elections were held along with Lok Sabha elections.
The Sikkim Grindikvari Morcha won the election by a landslide.
The party's leader, Prem Singh Damang, took over as the state chief minister.
But in 2016, a lower court sentenced Tamang to prison in a corruption case.
The Supreme Court confirmed this and he was sentenced to jail.
The controversy erupted as soon as Tamang took office, as a man who had been sentenced to prison for corruption cannot stand for election for six years.
In the meantime, Dammang is contesting the Sikkim Assembly by-election.
With the support of the BJP, Tamang is running the state.
In the meantime, Tamang had sent a letter to the Election Commission, citing various legal provisions, demanding the lifting of the six-year ban on him from contesting elections.
The Election Commission, having considered the situation, has announced that it will reduce the suspension period for Tamang to one year and one month.
This does not prevent Dammang from contesting the by-election.
The BJP can now use the privilege granted to Daman to start its politics in other states, including Tamil Nadu.
The Election Commission and the reports that it is carrying out the wishes of the BJP in full might also be published.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not mere praise that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thus to Indian politics.
We can still see a popular perception that revolutionaries are just stupid and uncaring.
The period of Bhagatsingh gives us a sense of his humanity, clear thinking and ability.
In April 1929, after the bombing of the Assembly, the name of Bhatt Singh became famous in India.
He made his public debut in Tamil Nadu in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history, the name of any leader born in Uttar Pradesh, including Gandhi, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
The reason for this is that of the father, Periyar.
The very next week, an editorial in the weekly Republican newspaper headlined 'Bhagatsingh'.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's cultural interests and offered some views on the political situation of the day.
Some excerpts from the editorial:-
"Indeed, Bhagat Singh was absolutely convinced that his principles were right and that the way he acted was the right way to do it. If he had decided that he must have acted as he did, we would say that he was a Yogic, and if he had not acted as he did, we would say that he was not a Yogic.
So now we call him a real man.
It is our strong conviction that what is really needed for India is the Bhagatsingh policy.
If Shri Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and killed, there would have been no reason for such a popularity.
If Bhagatsingh had not been hanged, we can say that Gandhi would have been a lot more.
Why did the mother who was so useful in showing the people of India the path of true equality and peace to the world, give her life for the sake of Bhagat Singh who was to be sick, sick, and ashes.
We praise Bhagat Singh with our hearts and our hands, saying that this is a feat that no one else can achieve by ordinary means!'
The same was mentioned by Father Periyar in the editorial of the Republican Journal.
Police officer Dennis Turner, who was on duty at the school, was arrested for allegedly hitting a teacher who was holding a girl.

His fingerprints were also taken.
The girl's family was later informed and she was handed over to her family.
It is not known if he took another child to the police station.
Her grandmother Kirkland, who has agreed to reveal the identity of the little girl, told the media that her granddaughter, who suffers from sleep apnea and is sometimes constipated as a result of the medication she takes for it.
I was shocked to hear that he was arrested for this, and it was difficult for any six-year-old to understand and explain.

According to the report, the nuclear sector has declined from 17.46 percent of the world's energy demand in 1996 to 10.15 percent in 2018.
This decline shows that the world is shifting its focus from nuclear energy to renewable, sustainable energy.
The use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro is increasing globally, leaving behind nuclear.
Every year, various agencies come together to produce a report on the state of the world's nuclear energy sector.

The Vikram lander has made a massive impact on the ground, according to NASA.
NASA's LROC Orbiter has captured images of the impact of the Lunar Orbiter 2's Vikram lander on the south pole of the Moon.
The Vikram lander of ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft touched down on the south pole of the moon on 7th of last month.
But at the last moment, the communication with it was lost.
The Vikram lander hit the lunar surface rather than landing slowly, so it was thought to have collapsed and lost contact.
In this context, NASA's LROC orbiter passed by the lunar south pole on 17th.
Vikram Land-Dwar landed at Simpeleas N and Mancins C, and photographed the plain between the two peaks in a very sophisticated way.
Analysis of the images confirmed that the Vikram Lander had made a violent impact.
That's why it fell far from the target.
John Keller, deputy director of NASA's EROC program, said: 'The LROC orbiter passed the south pole of the Moon on the 17th.
The video was sent in the evening, when the sky was dark.
The probe has been tested and it has been found that Vikram lander has hit the ground hard.
However, the exact landing location of Vikram Lander could not be traced.
The LROC R Bitter will pass the South Pole again on 14th.
The lighting is good and there is a good chance that the Vikram Lander will be photographed", he said.

If you reject the anti-democratic stance of the state, you can be arrested as an anti-nationalist.
An amendment has been made to this.
He accused human rights violations such as being jailed for criticizing the BJP or posting on social media as an extremist, and said the country is in an economic crisis.
Because people don't have the purchasing power.
But the government has given Rs 2 lakh crore to rich bosses.
He called on everyone to join the protests against this anti-people government from October 10 to 16.
He said that the Prime Minister is not concerned about the nation, not concerned about the economy, but is campaigning for Trump.
When an actor from Bangladesh came to India to do publicity, the Indian government stopped him.
But Modi has gone to the US to campaign for Trump to be re-elected.
Modi has since made sure that both have the same ideology.
The federalist doctrine is in doubt under the BJP government.

The nuclear supply group controls most of the world's nuclear trade.
India, as a member of the group, has been taking various initiatives.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of India.
He was very much against terrorism.
He reminded that India is the land of Buddha, Vivekananda, Ghanian Ponguranar and others.
Modi said: Our country has given the world the message of peace of Buddha, not war.

We see it as an act against the whole world and against humanity.
So the whole world must unite against terrorism.

In this election, Gotabaya Rajapaksa is running as the candidate of Mahinda Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Janaka Samajana Peramuna.

But both of these have not been fulfilled.
Currently, Sajid Premedasa is the candidate of the United National Party.
Sajid is the son of former President Premadasa.

But it was Periyar who insisted that women should be educated, their livelihoods improved, and given equal rights in property.
The scientist Anna is the one who made it.
Thus, under the rule of the DMAK leader, women were given reservation, equal rights in property, equal education and equal status.
The man who brought about all this was my father, Periyar.
The policy of Father Periyar is in danger.

The decision has been taken to discontinue the monthly stipend of Rs. 12,400 for students of M.Tech.
The Union Government has decided to reduce the funding of AIIBs in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Roorkee and Gauhati.
To cope with the shrinking funds, the Central Government has increased the fee to be charged from the students.
The Ministry has also directed the respective agencies to take up development work and to borrow from banks and corporates.
Since coming to power, the BJP has been preventing the common man from getting an education, cutting funding for primary education in the 2015 budget, and then drastically cutting funding for education in every budget.
The big businessmen then continued to open educational institutions to make private institutions more accessible.
In this context, the new education policy has imposed various rules on the private funding of educational institutions, without giving any importance to the public educational institutions.
The central government is working to take India back to the centuries of illiteracy and to bring back the prosperous future of India.

He said that even though Ranu passed away, he would live on through his works and through this book.

The DMK has asked the Chief Minister, Edappadi Palanisamy, how many dams were built during the last 8 years of Adhik regime.
In a statement, the party's treasurer, Durai Murugan, criticised the Chief Minister for not knowing any details about the public sector.
DMK Finance Minister Duraimurugan said in his report that the water that is released in Kaveri is wasted due to the negligence of the DMK government and the lack of administrative efficiency.
Our leader, M.K. Stalin, had expressed concern about the state's responsibility as the leader of the opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, saying that the A.D.M.K. government had no plan to stop the Kaveri from crossing.
Palanisamy, who thought that he was replying to the chief minister, asked, "Did the DMK, who are blaming us, build a dam in Kaveri during their rule?"
'I want to tell him that we have built a dam in the Karag regime at a place called Mayanoor in Kaveri under the DMK regime.
Can Chief Minister Edupatti Palaniswami, who is in charge of the public works department without even knowing that, speak outside the truth?
The dam at Mayanoor increased the water supply to the area.
And agriculture was booming.
The thousands of farmers in the area who are still benefiting from the benefits of this scheme are forever grateful to the government of the state.
The government of Karad built a dam at Mayanoor as per the demand of the time.
There was no need to build any more dams.
If it had been necessary, the then Chief Minister, Kirtish, would have given immediate permission, allocated funds and dismissed the minister.
So, Etapadi is not even close to blaming the government for maintaining the well-being of Kaveri.
I ask you, how many dams have you built in Kaveri during the last eight years of the AATMK rule?
Another question: We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the Dimag rule.
Can you point to any dam built during the DMK regime that has just happened?
Do not lie.
If you can answer the opposition leader's accusation, then show us where we are building or planning to build dams.
On the other hand, it may be a beautiful thing to say that no dam was built in Kaveri during the DMK regime, but I have to point out that for the Chief Ministership he holds, it is neither a civilised act nor a beauty.'
The State Bank of India has decided to fix the interest rate on a repo basis from 1st October, 2020.

Period for linking Aadhaar with PAN extended till 31st December.
The deadline for linking Aadhaar with PAN has been extended till December 31.
This is the seventh extension of the deadline for PAN-Aadhaar linkage by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
The Union Government had earlier extended this deadline by 6 months from 31st March to 30th September.
This period has now been extended for another 3 months.
Aadhaar number is a 12-digit number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to every citizen of India.
The Income Tax Department issues a 10-digit numbered and written Permanent Income Tax Account Number (PAN) to the individual or entity paying income tax.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes had issued a notification on 1st July 2017 to link Aadhaar with the Income Tax Number.
The time for Aadhaar-PAN link has been extended several times since then.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, hearing a case against the issuance of Aadhaar cards to citizens, ruled in September last year that the Aadhaar scheme is legal.
The Supreme Court also ruled that Aadhaar number is mandatory for paying income tax.
Meanwhile, the Union Budget of 5 July 2020 announced that Aadhaar number is sufficient instead of PAN number for filing income tax returns.
DMK leader M.K. Stalin visited the excavation sites of Vaikkar, which showcase the Tamil culture.
The results of the survey revealed that the biology of the times is the life of the Tamils who lived in blood and flesh; it is not myth.
Urban civilization began in the 6th century BC on the banks of the Ganges River in the north.
But the archaeological evidence has scientifically proven that the Tamils in the southern banks of the Vaibhavi River in the 6th century BC lived a high-class urban life, and that the Tamils were literate and had a rich and prosperous life.
The findings of the excavations are creating the possibility of rewriting the history of the Indian subcontinent.
A large number of people visit the Dardari observatory, which is a source of pride for every Tamil.

Trump calls for investigation of Ukraine's president
The White House has confirmed that it is true that Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to demand an investigation against former vice president Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential candidate.
The House of Representatives has proposed a motion of impeachment against Trump, calling for the US president to be investigated by the other country under pressure.
In this regard, six committees have been set up on the orders of Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy and have begun an inquiry into the action of the chairman.
Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the phone on July 25, so investigate", Trump said.
The White House released an official statement yesterday on the two presidents' conversations.
So it is accepted that this conversation took place.
Speaking to reporters outside the United Nations, Trump said the request was amicable.
He said that no pressure had been put on the Ukrainian president.
But the one thing to note is that the US government abruptly stopped its aid to Ukraine of about $400 million.
And then after some time, the funds were allocated.
The Democrats are now making a fuss over this and Trump's remarks to the president.
So this incident has started a storm in American politics.

The Republican Party is accusing Joe Biden of having a hand in the matter.
But Hunter has consistently denied the accusation that he used his father for his business.
The incident of a government official beating up journalists in the presence of the Minister of Education, Chengu Chettai, has caused a stir.
The Minister also inaugurated the Red Fort project at Tooknaikappayam, near Gopi in Erode District.
While the reporters were taking pictures of him, Muthulingam, an assistant engineer of the Tamil Nadu Drainage Board, was standing in the way.

Minister Chengotayyan, aware of his drunkenness, ordered his immediate removal.
The top officials then dismissed Muthulinga as not being present at the ceremony and asked him to leave immediately.

The area was a prosperous area from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.
The study also examines the urbanisation of the Dewas River based on the evidence available.
Scientific chronology in the underground excavation has concluded that the Tamil-Brahmi era is more than 100 years older. The study shows that Tamil Nadu was a literate society as early as the 6th century BC.
Further, samples from 70 skeletal remains unearthed through this study have been sent to Deccan College, a postgraduate research institution for scientific analysis.
The fossils were analyzed and characterized by the species of whale, buffalo, vulture, wild boar, rhino and mule.
The study also included the use of cows, buffaloes and elephants as food animals, as well as the use of cutting spots on some of the animals that are found in the animal models, such as the rhino, the wolf and the wild boar.
The Sanskrit society was primarily agricultural, and the people of the region were also engaged in animal husbandry.
Samples of brick-lime roof tiles and mud-slide plaster have been sent to Vellore Technical University for analysis.
Each of these minerals, such as silicon, lime, iron, aluminium and magnesium, is found in the study.
To preserve such rare relics, work is being done to set up a museum at a prime location to make the area of Dharamsala accessible to a large number of Tamil scholars, students and the general public.
The excavation of the fifth phase will be extended for two weeks and work will continue.

Bill Gates Foundation Award for Indian girl who fought against child marriage.
For her work in the fight against child marriage and child labour, a 17-year-old girl from Rajasthan has been conferred the 'Change Maker' award by the Bill Gates Foundation.
Payal Jankit (17) is a girl from Hinsla village, 100 km from Jaipur, Rajasthan.

A general amnesty has been declared in Jordan for a further period of two months.
According to the Foreign Employment Bureau, the Jordanian embassy has announced that the amnesty, which began on September 22, will continue until November 29.

A similar amnesty was announced in Jordan last February for foreigners who are staying illegally.
Is the BJP taking up the cause of caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
If Tamil Nadu is unable to produce a lotus or a flower, it is said that the BJP will eventually take over the caste politics.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, Tamil Nadu was in a situation where it was necessary to look at the palm tree by hand.
Then, for the second time, during the MP elections, he said, 'I don't know what you will do, but Tamara must bloom in Tamil Nadu.'
However, the party has only been able to win soil in all the five constituencies.
The country is in full swing with the BJP but the opposition is in full swing in Tamil Nadu.
This is above all the issues of triple talaq, Kashmir, Hindi, one nation, one language.
And it's all coming together in this way that it's still very much in the spotlight.
That is why the BJP leadership is so critical of the Tamil Nadu BJP executives and why it is so difficult to appoint the state leadership.
On one side, the BJP is planning to eradicate the BJP in Tamil Nadu somehow by the next assembly elections.
The BJP leadership seems to have come to a conclusion through direct field reports, intelligence reports and the like.
Accordingly, whether it is the AIM or the DMK, the feeling among the people of the respective communities is that the two Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the Nadar people, the Vanniyar people and the Devendra Gulavellar people.
This is said to have made Dravida unhappy with the parties.
This is the trick that the BJP has taken up and started to implement.
He has decided to give a post of honour to the particular caste in a way that makes them proud or important.
The appointment of Tamiji Sai Chaudhrarajan as the governor of Telangana is one such example.
Similarly, the BJP government is said to be giving importance to the top-ranking statesmen in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts in this way, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of each caste.
And, unlike anything else, this caste politics will be the bane of the BJP.
At the same time, with Tamil Nadu already mired in caste politics, it is unclear whether the BJP's actions will add fuel to the fire.
If the fire of the Sati burns, the whole of the tamarisk that is now a little blooming in Tamil Nadu will be consumed by the same fire!

The special guest was Traffic Inspector Sivasankaran, who flagged the awareness rally and handed out a guidebook on road safety rules to the students.
He said that the need for road rules should start with the students, because the parents and the society have trusted them.
The youth are the most affected in road accidents and awareness programmes like this should be conducted in schools and colleges to prevent this.
Everyone should observe traffic rules not to impose fines but to save your life.
Students should wear headgear while riding in a two-wheeler and should never use a cell phone while driving.
The driver should learn the rules of the road and drive the vehicles.
The drivers should cooperate with the traffic police.
If the administration of every college keeps monitoring the students for their compliance with the rules of the road, then the precious lives of students can be saved.
The future of the country is in the hands of the youth and it is the duty of the traffic police and the public to protect such youth.
The meeting was attended by Assistant Inspector Ravikumar, Chief Guardsmen Kandeep, Sinivasan and Thyagarajan.
Today marks 42 years since Professor Senaga lost his life in the battle of the Somme.
Today marks the 42nd anniversary of the death of Professor Senegah Vibe, the pioneer of the National Drug Policy.
He was murdered in a gruesome manner on the island of Guyana.
He was the first professor of medicine in India.
Professor Senaga Vipil has served as the first Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Padang.
He has been exposed to the issues related to the sale of drugs by multinational companies and has been subjected to various pressures by these vendors in the country.
The loss to the government is in the crores of rupees due to drugs imported into the country under various names.
He therefore highlighted the need for a National Pharmacy Policy.
He worked to ensure that patients had access to 335 medicines at reasonable prices and in high quality.
Due to this, he was the patron of several institutions.
The mystery of his death has not been solved yet.
In his address to the United Nations today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not utter a single word on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
The 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly is currently underway.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the nation.
In his speech, he called for the world to unite against terrorism.

The Prime Minister said that India is making a major contribution towards the solution to the problem of global warming and the world is proud that India's contribution to global warming is less and the solution is more.
The Government of India is making a serious effort to become a plastic-free country.
He said that a great health insurance scheme is being implemented in India.
Yadav urare everyone listen to him. PM gives a wonderful speech to the world in Tamil
But nowhere in his speech did he mention the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
The reason for this is that the Central Government is firmly of the view that Jammu and Kashmir is an internal affair of India.
Political observers say that Modi deliberately refused to say a single word about Jammu and Kashmir, as Pakistan wants to make it an international issue.
The message has been given to the world that Kashmir is an internal matter of India.
