No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned as part of a novel of the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have shaped the way to the release of the detained Prime Minister, the MPs rejected in the second reading of the request to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for allegedly disadvantaged agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not lawful yet, and the appeal of the convicted will be discussed before the court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the judgment as the political revenge of the regime, and even in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to be removed from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes would have been required to accept it.
Victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan Liberation Struggle or Libyan Rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners have to be defined.
As this region is usual, winning in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was aware of the law of the Sharia, which is now a certain idea of God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft the hand is shortly hacked.
Even women should forget the thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any believers are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of mutual tribes will be united by the Qur’an.
In short, there will be a rule in Libya which this country is hardly imaginable and above all hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyers.
In this way, it is rather frightening that Muslim fighters could help themselves by the unbelievers dogs.
To their apology may only serve the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any American general, but by Allah himself, whose all-power was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? the West does not belong to it.
We only took part in a shift, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians relaxed in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this bringing any advantage.
Following the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
This leads to a concern, namely the expulsion of the cruise drivers.
But will the mineral oil companies get the black gold to the spot price even without occupation?
Well hardly and so the West can finally be proud of its right to self-righteousness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy the Sharia representatives.
The beginning of a new crisis
France and the rest of Europe are in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke across Europe.
The individual states published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France raise.
Nowadays, the bond market has broken all records.
Investors keep not only Greece in mind, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% compared to France by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany higher growth than originally was expected (growth by 0.3% rather than forecasted 0.1%), while France a slight decline by 0.1% (originary data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the GDP stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend of slowing growth of economic performance was confirmed.
The results are worse than the analysts forecast.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagged compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
In the whole of the euro area and in the EU, the economy a 0.2% growth between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with the analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The revenue from its 10-year state bonds climbed the value of 28.45%.
The returns of Italian and Spanish bonds rose to their critical boundaries.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems.
The return on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, votes will be loud, the ECB must become the last instance creditors.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football match has been the hardest task of the whole season.
Thanks to a well-established Torwarts Čech and a magnificent Tor by Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advance from the home game and will not be missing at the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Less excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, and thus paid their ticket for the football-EM.
Also due to the precise defense match of the Czech teams, they put the Montenegriners under more pressure only in the second half.
The puppets of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who lost two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech the Czech selection will participate in the European Championships next year, it is also pleased that the domestic football will be awarded a prize of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes a lot of football was played.
Both teams combined long and so played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained out, and the broad defeats before the penalty room were successfully defended by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of college students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students had prayed before the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is being processed.
Thus they wanted to show that they were ready to protect the core program of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran apparently has long failed to give up after its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed before entering the complex in the afternoon and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack intended to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program, the Israeli press said the center in Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan's target.
The food card of a fat baby: it doesn't breakfast and is eating for dinner bread
More than one-third of children between 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys have shown that adipose children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows and the examples that surround him are.
On the tables of adipose children, roots are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had afternoon bread with the motto “Adipositas is not a coincidence.”
In families with thickness, sport is not just one of the favourite occupations, but it affects the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents at least once a week find time for active exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted last year at the end of the school year, with 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was the second anniversary of the “Adipositas is not a coincidence” campaign, which is supported by the General Hospital and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are critical factors that are responsible for the terribly growing number of children with overweight or even fatigue.
"Only half of the children surveyed led, for example, to eat breakfast-second breakfast-middle-Vesper dinner bread five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," one of the survey finds.
No breakfast and no dinner bread.
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the students’ families eat breakfast.
And - in most families each breakfast for himself.
The worst was the conclusion that in every 10th family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, brought the day that in the families of overweight children much more often unhealthy potatoes are consumed.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do that – that is, only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu.
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to set up their own diet plan from the options offered by appetite and opinion.
What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many milk foods, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarging is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the conclusive report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. at the main dining, tiger goods almost defeated the birds.
The children didn’t like garlic fruits, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are ready to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
“In the control group of the survey participants who filled the questionnaire after the conclusion of the explanatory lecture ‘Adipositas is not a coincidence’, in many cases a significant shift of preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition was to be,” it is said in the results of the project.
This was sudden, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often birds or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat fewer garlics or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had a little confused that it was a little too much material for the beginning.
I didn’t know at least what else would come.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how that "on the place" runs.
It should be even worse.
The closer the examination goes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportionate figure.
And that’s the majority of us.
The one has a too short neck, the other a too young figure without proper curves and the other are mollig.
It’s the thing of the stylist to visually cast wide shoulders, extend the neck or highlight the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a female type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a big bus, wide hips and thin tail - beautiful and figurative without it seeming too provocative.
For example, if the difference between the tail and heads is so large that the rock or pants really don’t fit, you should have to cut yourself at least a piece by measure.
You will not regret that, because well sitting clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a scattered rock, you feel much better than in one of the stange that is always high and rough, in the tail, etc.
Young-hearted figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothes with wrinkles, buildings, applications, stickers or refining.
With this lot of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible in view of the imposed homework.
Each of the participants was awarded a promi for which they intended to design suitable outfits - day clothes and evening clothes.
In this case, we should take into account the current appearance, the model of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I’m going to “take” Miranda Kerr, which you may know from the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
Inside I’m glad because it’s much better for me personally than to attract, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilograms in recent times (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We will cut the clothes out of magazines or search on the internet, print and then edit graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the style as well.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (as specifically prescribed, for example, trend handbags, mantles, etc.).
This was told by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday’s lecture filled with information about figure types was driven by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the Jeans, such as a T-shirt or mantle, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear shoes and wear it as a dress.
It’s enough to raise the armbands or knees and the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he emphasized.
But the following advice came to me: “First you have to know the rules perfectly.”
“Only then you can hurt them,” said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we need to pack all these lessons, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often see quite different things in fashion newspapers.
Not to mention fashion.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to stylish at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
With all of this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of success, Jan Pokorný also confirmed.
You just need to see Madonna, a not just brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known persons often consider this for throwed money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look secondary).
And if someone of us is already styled, then we must expect that he or she will likely force us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you just need to googled to make sure that the bulevard press writes that the corresponding promi has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then “build together” the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylishes and he must be a skilled psychologist.
People appreciate, without settling and standing in their opinion.
“If any manager orders us to take care of her closet and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can’t waste her the whole closet and say, my God, that’s terrible.”
"You have to find at least a few praiseful things to recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very concrete what such a so-called “plate bag” must include.
So such a bag that you put on the tail and in which you carry all the necessary property with you.
In addition to such clear things, such as scratches, hair removal scratches or safety scratches, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon scratch (this helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats out), special clips, with which the clothes are touched back if they are too big (stop scratches or other scratches are prohibited so that the material is not broken) and, of course, scratches.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly cover the shoes.
Also when photographing in the atelier, where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe chain, silence the outside.
We clothed and clothed...
You can’t even touch the shoes, so you don’t hurt them.
So you really need to be skilled.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
That skill is not my strength.
All this was just a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me: dedicating yourself to styling at a professional level is not a child’s game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race around America
Review
The original careless journey becomes a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes to the routine journey to the early layer.
It managed to fulfill the ambitions in a large part, but what is it useful if obviously no one had the desire to do a little more.
Even before he arrived on the shop, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" woke high expectations.
But he promised to move the game series "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension, and in the playable demonstration examples it seemed not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the embedded passes come out, where the main protagonist rises out of the car and goes on foot.
But as you’ve been used to NFS, in the end, it’s a lot different than you expected.
Certain - potentially they are quite decent Arkade races, but overall, the game is scattered by some unnecessary errors that are present in this series more or less for a few years.
So they are actually no mistakes anymore, but rather signs of a principally incomprehensible fault of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time one is introduced into the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal racing throughout America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit on the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages are held in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You have no moment of the impression that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still extremely beautiful to look, although the technical level of the graph does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
Nothing moving world.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn landscape or high up through the deep snowed landscape works visually very pleasant.
Sometimes untypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the sight.
In the mountains again, you have to be careful that you are not scattered by a lavin.
At the same time, the individual races are well-established.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overcome the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stop hour), then you are waiting for another personal duel with a single opponent.
There is also a police officer who is trying to disguise the whole matter.
A new thing is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about some interactive animations where Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passes in the game than you would expect (specially probably only three).
Finally, this is the thing rather to benefit, because so this element at least has no chance to get bored - it belongs in the context of the above to the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model passes in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, though it doesn’t cut out trees, on the other hand, it could not be claimed to be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations must look elsewhere.
But to an action-loaded race, the home driving model will continue to fit very well, although you could find better in the competition.
So far, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only arise after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not completely OK.
From a game of this kind is hard to expect it to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no explosion on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
A typical example: When closely riding or pre-driving on arrival cars, you “track” the other car easily in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the slides and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car runs down.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t work any more, it’s annoying all the time.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you have spent it out, everything goes out from the front.
Therefore, the restarts are more like a help, for the event that something fails, but you should not rely on it.
But sometimes even restart doesn’t help, so nothing else helps but learning the critical section from the head.
Explicitly unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, need to pass in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don’t fit through.
Otherwise, in the appropriate place you meet "civil" cars always in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is annoying in situations when you see that the counterpart passes in front of a playing on two opposing cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to cross or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The counterparts have other advantages.
Thro the game there are a few places where you are always overwhelmed at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy is this to finish the game on the long bridge, which is passed in the opposite direction.
The opponent must surrender one here obviously to the devil.
And if he is already in front of one, then he naturally takes a look, so you start driving your own car in clump a few times.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly loses the joy of the game.
And that’s a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-loaded that you almost don’t know where one of the heads is.
And, in principle, it doesn’t matter what’s “guilt” about it – the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no delusion can occur, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the races.
You should not ignore the tank stations on the route, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is enough that you are just having.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are good for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical trips, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode goes also the task mode (defiance) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points to win for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (the challenges) and history.
To get to a higher driver level, different items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously associated with the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible scratches is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car to a subway tunnel (for me), where you get in the darkness on the railways (for me).
On the Tacho, figures look between 150 and 200 km/h (for me), but there suddenly a subway comes from the back and runs a compromise-free break.
In our editorial, we will probably continue to debate for a long time about whether this was a black-out of the game makers or whether the authors consider us so foolish.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite attractive in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
The more annoying is that in some exciting moments the image recovery frequency becomes slower and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, applies primarily to accidents with a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyway.
The sound is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to address a as wide as possible scale rather young audience, a soundtrack a lá "from everyone something" emerged - but who purchases such a game already because of music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? the feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn’t shattered by the mentioned completely unnecessary errors, we would have been able to claim with the brust of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But so the game seems somehow unfinished.
A class of pleasure for itself, but you should be prepared to put those errors into your eyes with the power of airport lamps.
Concert of the "Students of the Summed Revolution" with singing sets of the Charles University
The Festa Academica Festival offers for the third time the celebration of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samtenen Revolution and this as well as music experience.
During the festival they present themselves to the twentieth vocational and high school courts.
The focus of the festival is the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
“The University of Charles has a big part in the festival.”
“According to the participants, the Chor of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies is also represented, and in the festival committee, among other things, the Rector Václav Hampl is sitting,” said the head of the organization team, Jakub Čaloun.
The absolute peak of the festival is the public concert of specialized school lectures, which will take place on November 17 at 14 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the programme is the composition of the significant Czech Jazzer Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening, the concert "Students of the Summit Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gallery rooms of the People's House in Vinohrady, where also high school chores, chores of the Charles University are not excluded.
Festa Academica aims not only to honor the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but to present chormusics to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative collaboration of young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Chors in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler High School.
The entire event was dominated by Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of the Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule includes numerous music meetings, student hoppanings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the festival’s website www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czech Republic has the reputation of negativists and euroskeptics
“The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions feelable out of the lot.”
I’t have expected such a hard war to burn out.”
“There will take five or six years until the waves climb and everyone will have become accustomed to their new role,” Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, very sharply began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto “Comprehensible and open about Europe,” she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that she could have so hated some lecturers at the Faculty of Law at the University of Charles.
Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
“In the beginning, criticism was loud, he was too unnoticable – a gray officer who has not grown up in such a role, but I have to say that it has swallowed the breath of everyone, how well he has accepted the matter.
“He is a person who makes it possible to listen patiently to, communicate with, twenty-seven member states, and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as a response to the question: Who is this actually – the European Union? which number should I call?”, which is an important step towards the unity and better readability of the EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil makers Quargel
Mrs. Vicenová also dedicated itself to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lived and commemorated to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago he described as a success.
The Czechs had addressed the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the presidency he described as a great negative, which seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
In the words of the ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, went quite harsh.
And then the EU’s seven-year budget needs to be approved, which makes it much more complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether it’s going to be a smooth and safer budget, which sectors are prioritized, which countries are more and which are less promoted – all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds her of her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: “Comprehensible about Europe.”
"If I don't like something, then it's graceful shortcuts, foreign words, and professional jargons that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, really know if in Brussels you really think of crum or round gourmet and various large bananas, or if someone really wants to ban us the quargel.
She would also like to use the EU land to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are in the call to be euroskeptics who see more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The worse is the weak representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are guilty of this, including the retention of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
Believe me, when a Poland or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the French next to me thinks, "Hey, what do you put your heads together - is this your V4 again?"
According to Vicenové, the EU is expecting strict rules for the budget policy of the Member States in the future.
As much more realistic than a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries in the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
“We have the Schengen space and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation.”
“For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those that don’t want it should stand quiet away.”
“There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong ‘Europe of different speeds’,” said Vicenová.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues with impact on the EU should be discussed by all Member States and not only by the Eurozone countries.
The Brand Story:
The IBM Innovator enters the second century of its existence
If you were looking for the right word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate, then this would probably be the word “length”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has been a century since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was set by her first boss, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
He has already expressed the slogan, countless world-wide problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan “Think!” became a brand mark that would play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the corporate magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not fear to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform the technology, the business and the society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
The thought system
Watson has already operated social care for his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The people of IBM had as one of the first American employees paid holidays, an entrepreneur insurance plus elegant uniforms as working clothes and a thoughtful paying system for the best novice and dealer.
Similarly, IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are also exhausted.
The company was genius in talent promotion from the beginning – as one of the first companies in the world, IBM raised any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is also that Palmisan in the top of IBM will be replaced by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been in IBM for thirty years, and so far she has assumed the position of business, marketing and strategy manager.
In recent years, IBM has made so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations are growing.
No wonder, there are enough ideas, half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Your impeccable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a simple technology company,” said Economist, professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of Consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it’s a difference to be only present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of family called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It’s one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, stripcode or even the discet.
With a stock value of approximately $220 billion (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (equally after Apple), with it overcome Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers – unhappy were for example the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on moving forward, so you should not be emotionally bound to the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Successful Technologies
IBM’s profits are largely contributed by services, software and hardware are contributed by one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was the strongest represented with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-friendly technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the recent financial crisis for the first time hit the world like a storm.
Also here, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment scope in the middle of the major global economic crisis.
Until now, it seems that IBM has survived the current crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares has risen rocket-like by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s revenue continues to grow.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed, but not the values.
This is also why we can expect this flexible giant to cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cash Cutting to Space Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took it only in 1924 – originally it was a brand name for a headquarters in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the subsequent company IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous card clocks to register the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was the chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competitive company Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's ideas is based to date the unbeatable culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the manufacturing and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from rubber and cash cutting machines to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was sitting in the chief chair for forty years, only then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA guide flights into the universe - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture, the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came to market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the concept of “Smart Planet”.
It constitutes the intention of smartly deploying technologies in unplanned areas, for example in order to improve the situation in the transport and urban administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently launched the “Smart Commerce” platform, which aims to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded its headquarters in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a top world-class research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful spouse:
Iveta - you can keep this esel, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it is over!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it has finally passed with patience and for the next life it has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered asylum to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she’t even dream of how it goes with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to Říčany after thirty days on her pressures, Joseph went with him.
He even knew publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, even it seemed like she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the run passport.
Rychytář doesn't care with whom his wife is sleeping
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not hunt him out.”
"But not as a loved, lost old esel, but as a man with whom I still have certain bonds," said Mrs. Rychtářová, but she also said she has already been emotionally separated from him and is alone on mutual dignity.
The fact that Darina has closed the back door to him, Joseph has so far been wearing with dignity.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’m going to stay with Iveta, it doesn’t change.”
“My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that.”
“The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the purchases.”
“With Darina I talk quite normally, only the bed we don’t just share,” said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who it is.
I’m clear that this is my fault, I’m in love with Iveta, and that’s why I assume any responsibility.
The worst female disgrace: what about you?
If you ask men to call some typical female disgrace, then they undeniably throw some quickly out of the arm.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitten revues pass again, which let men flow the blood into the eders?
The shopping
Does your partner prefer to be shopping-scient?
Do you need to buy at least one hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more in action?
In your case, it is a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust half under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman has it out of looking for a well sitting top clothes just thus through a clothing store and not just try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you’ve said to your husband, you’d rather stay out.
Continuous dissatisfaction
“I’m not too thick?”
"I have to lose at least five pounds - should I start running or doing gymnastics?"
“Are I missing you at all?”
Is it somehow known to you?
Yes ?
You may also belong to the women who are rightly obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly jamming about her appearance.
The stronger sex is consistent - with the increasing frequency of disorders, women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness at first.
It is a fight against windmills.
Washing windows, washing flies and dust, washing the bath - and doing this at least twice a week.
Shampoo with her partner, because he again trampes on the clean flies with dirty shoes, the children shed you, because the just shattered washing pool is already dirty again and because the glass door in the living room has fingerprints again, where the polishing does so much effort?
If you suffer from this type of "deviance", then you should know that nothing should be exaggerated and order and purity in family life are not in the first place.
This immeasurable shade of purity can eventually also damage the mutual relationships and, above all, the peace in the family.
The Stick
“The dirty tournaments come into the washing cart.”
“Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?”
“You don’t just throw a wet handheld on the floor.”
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, it doesn’t mean bad, they just want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to make so much.
Clash and Clash
Some women like to climb and climb, then behind the back they are blurred or even blurred or they are blurred allies.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to engage in such topics as, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well each of us women have a little harmless crack and crack on stock.
Hand on heart – that’s all women’s own.
But this is not to be confused with clashes of the greatest calibers, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who possibly neglect everyone in their surroundings and which are a significant danger especially for women’s collectives.
Jágr and Voráček bring Philadelphia to victory with their assistants
The ice hockey turner Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina in the NHL's Monday match with two assistants, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The user of the overview of the ninety-thirds-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added another assist and was named the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game was also recorded by Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had propheted Giroux a great evening.
“Even before the game I told him that he’s going to get a hattrick today.”
I felt that somehow.”
“He has this feeling again and again,” declared Jágr, after whose action Giroux has already reached a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had a "Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the door of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first-third break, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hand, but the second-third then belonged back to the Flyers.
The Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he achieved his third goal, followed by Wayne Simmonds his shot to the fourth gate.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jagr said.
"I't remember in my life that I'm playing with such a ice hockey player as with him at the end of my career."
“I am very pleased with that.”
“I cut my game on me.”
"All the years in the NHL, my co-players put their game on me and now the spike turns around," Jagr said.
Carolina made the game to the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who passed out of a punishment, it came to a gate.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in over number two against one.
"Excellent Pronger acted still in our zone."
“He grew the puck, I took the ride up and (read) moved to distant posters.”
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last match from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia stood at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček wounded himself in the match against Buffalo and scored in the second quarter due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candiens, in addition to their experienced Beck, also gave their leadership an unlost in penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points probably hurt the home team's coach by the high disease-related failure in the defense - the game they played only with five defense players to end.
“This is bad.”
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
“But there’s nothing to be done, we have to do it,” said Jacques Martin.
“In every change one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to resist it.”
"We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
On the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different defenders had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the then Czech Republic: Čedok, Sportturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time the travel agencies sold only travel to the socialist eastern bloc countries, in the West only selected people were allowed.
And so, Czech tourists travel to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia introduced a pro-west course and therefore the travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
One great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not allowed even to the citizens of the Eastern Block (thus also to the Czechoslovak) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the USSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
At that time the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then they had to buy enormous serpents or even stay in the sleep bag before the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
It was also not so long.
The so-called currency use - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchanged currency, so without the use of the currency it would have been impossible to provide the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The most Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dats - a habit that lasts until today.
The gathered revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs—Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the Yugoslavia at the time.
Just from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation to the neighboring Western European countries was abolished, causing a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechs could not get enough from their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech travellers slept in the telt in the park when they traveled to Paris, because who had already had the money for a hotel or a pension at that time.
A typical feature of foreign trips of the Czechs at that time was a packed bag room with conservances, beer and durable roast, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangable Czech crown – after decades, our tourists could finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our living level and thus also the average salary increased, which in 1997 led to another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare charter flights after 1997, making the flights incredibly cool, thanks to the possibility of trading quantities, compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already undue payment transactions with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the “post-samination” travel traffic came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly annually to remote sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
The 100 Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa obligation for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs for the first time spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 CZK per person for a single holiday stay including the cost of the holiday site.
The general assembly is to find a new chairman - again threatens a patt.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not had a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until now, there is no agreement on which election order to be voted.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek withdrew from his office, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old crosses between the two association chambers again broke out, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had entered the House of People in the Prague district of Smíchov completely free of charge, because the negotiations did not lead to any outcome and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who actually has the right to vote at the General Assembly—only the constitutional representatives or even the officials equipped with a power.
At the same time, at least partly agreement was reached, which was also accompanied by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion is that a representation on the basis of authority is not possible.
However, disputes on the electoral order continue.
The executive committee also did not bring more clarity to the matter, in whose meetings – whether ordinary or extraordinary – in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even though the views regarding the choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to take action in the third round to avoid a Patt situation?
“The dispute is about whether to act in accordance with the statute, or whether to find a completely different model,” said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round the candidate who receives the largest percentage of support in the Chamber for which he candidates will win.
Mähren is allegedly ready to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage of votes.
"Therefore, the two front rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Mahric side, which is best to not add the electoral order, but to vote according to a valid constitution.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, although it is noted that the constitutional electoral order of all candidates is most likely to be opposed to Pelta.
“My desire is that the majority of the votes will be voted according to the Constitution.”
"So that no unthinkable replacement variants will be invented, as in the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who first candidates and discarded in his opinions especially to Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
“The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would contribute to calming the mood.”
“If football runs on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater,” says the Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experience of all three adeptes, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more resilient.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately divergent.”
“This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to ‘rightect’ the rules for their own purposes.”
“Therefore, a re-blocking at the General Assembly is not excluded.”
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time for all sides to agree is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter aircraft, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disruption and so it was feverily sought for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee yet to the location of the Barrage match.
The meeting on the ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, will be decisive.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for school, youth and body education, would like to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of the Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will show the new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the struggle for the presidential position because he does not see any suitable candidates.
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, had been able to form a strong candidate before the extraordinary general assembly, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Federation of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would have not engaged in the struggle for this top position at all.
“If there was a good supporter, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation it failed to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is, therefore, to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he remembers to exercise the function of the chairman only for a year, i.e., until 2013, until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much immersed in the football event.
“I personally talked to some of the people in question.”
“It’s hard to believe that some told me they didn’t want to identify with the Czech football at the moment.
“These views would have changed,” he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is considered behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta had the position of chairman.
“With his victory, the current state would be preserved and in the Czech football it would not progress at all.”
“The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, gets football twice bad,” Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelta's name was some time ago in connection with telephone calls for investigation in a corruption case, but from which Pelta came without punishment.
“I don’t know what prestige a Pelta’s victory should bring to football.”
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who said in his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes the chairman."
If Paclík wins on Thursday's election, he could definitely imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is thought by another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended with a fiasko.
“He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to.”
“He has great abilities.”
“I could imagine him as the head of the national team.”
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
“I don’t put my nose in matters I don’t understand,” said Paclík, who in September had provided the supervision that he was the leader behind the arbitration commission with Luďěk Macela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the federation chairman has grown.
And it is based on his skills in managing private firms, since last summer he is also the chief of Pilsen, who with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the league.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to some cultivation of it.”
“To limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which extends to disadvantaged situations,” said Paclík, who doesn’t make no heal from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta leader Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby among the top political politicians for more money flowing from the lottery tax to the sport.
“This is one of the crucial things the new president should dedicate to.”
“If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argumentation, but then they also have to cut down and clearly say where the money goes,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a disability, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAČR must be "overparty".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
“This is not exactly ideal.”
"It does not make much sense, in my opinion, to apparently transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that will trigger a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Federation, one of the candidates for the presidential office, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he will make strength for the FAČR to obtain new statutes that will in the future exclude disputes about the electoral order from advance.
The Jablonec official is confident before Thursday's Nymburk negotiation and believes that the election campaign will survive if the Czech election succeeds.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he would focus on the national team and earning funds in the event of his election.
He decided to take part in the election before the last General Assembly until the last moment, so the two-month break helped him defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present in a broader context.
“People at all levels are dedicated to football, they’re impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“He feels that it’s the highest time for the association to be led by someone, says the man who is primarily connected to the Jablonecer club, but who has also acted for many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today’s problems with the election is responsible the euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Hašek.
Unfortunately, at the General Assembly in June, statutes were approved that were not as complete as everyone had assumed.
If they didn’t allow different interpretations, we’d already have a chairman from September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the review of the most important document of the citizens’ association that he used as a lock for the delegates.
“If I have to become president, then I take it personally and am ready to take responsibility personally if it fails.”
“This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be,” says Pelta.
Moreover, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first deputy representative.
Even Tomáš Paclík has long failed to touch, who, in turn, did not leave a dry fade on Pelta.
He has been moving in football for more than a year and can already point to certain successes.”
However, his attacks were devastating and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
“It’s also why many now doubt his true character,” Pelta addressed his counterpart, who is likely to remain faithful to his statements, which he said in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower class to the national team.
And this should be the outskirts of the Czech football.
“I would also endeavour to end all affairs—from the Causa of Bohemian, to the discontinuation of the corruption scandal last year.”
“In the same time, I’d go into negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football,” the sixteen-year-old candidate said two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football will not mean personal cleansing.
“I first have to get familiar with the work content of all the workers,” he said to Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, consciously nervousness runs.
Despite the disastrous scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates don’t go free to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If it really should be the only controversial point as you choose in the third round, then we're going out of it."
“Football needs credibility and it’s only winning when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will begin to work hard among him
If the former deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl would be elected as the new chairman of the Football Federation of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday, it would allegedly miss the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that he will begin to work hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football fields.
In addition, he promised to solve the case of Bohemian, to improve the relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and otherwise to continue the work that former president Ivan Hašek started.
“As a president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, national elections, professional football, and performance football for youth.”
"I don't want to say that I'm going to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a talk to ČTK.
“I’m a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area.”
And I’m going to distribute tough tasks so that football is going forward with milestones in every segment.”
Many would not be disappointed, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they had to start working very hard,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement I considered not to nominate anymore.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't throw my buttons between my legs and question every step I'm taking," he said as an explanation why he has delayed.
“But many people told me I shouldn’t give up because otherwise others would do it.”
“It’s trust that you can’t miss,” he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
“In two years we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t just want to throw it away.”
“There have been processes that are likely to come into force only in a few years and I would just don’t want to see someone stop them,” he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate – Miroslav Pelta – would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are people who would make football so that he would only be there for elected.”
You can accuse me of some things, but not that I’m partial.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because it’s going well for everyone and not just the elected,” Rajchl said.
He also opposes the claim that he is just a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have the intention to do the best possible for myrtles."
“For example, it’s time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Maurician part, whose winners will then rise to the first league.”
"Then it could not happen that today only three merchandise clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in merchandise," Rajchl said.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the struggle for the presidency, Rajchl does not dare to appreciate his chances that he will be elected.
“I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me,” Rajchl said, who also sees the savings of hundreds of millions of crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television transactions and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty that the association is not pulling on a single string.
While he says of Pelta, "he is previously disqualified to help the Czech football regain confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
“No one can question that he has done excellent work in a single year.”
“If he would be elected, then he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek initiated and also the staff occupation in the committees he would obviously not fundamentally change.”
He won’t want things to be in his favor,” Rajchl judges about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Planschbecks in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after a city tour or a walk the tired legs relax in sprinks.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on research trips over the past one and a half years, one was not missing in her baggage: her bathing bag.
Leaving back on the water, she looked up in artistically shaped cups, she swimed in front of the marble pockets waiting for her on the basin edge, and wondered about acrylicly restored youth-style swim halls.
She liked a bath, she took it flugs in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored by architectural historian Meder in this way - and now present it in her newly published book "Badefreuden": People's swimming pools in Munich, historic swimming pools in the Black Forest, "Hardcore beton buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she conducted her "travel to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bath culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much on the hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
Sadly, swimming fans have to find themselves with blue cakes and chlorgestank, while joggers can breathe the intriguing smell of flat forests or hear the joyful bird switches in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools really have to be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
Placer in the jump pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in the baths is so large because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have made a lot of effort, swimming pools can be a real mirror: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in the baths."
“It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything doubles optically: high bulbs, colourful cakes, jumpbretters.
The small-informative image band "Badefreuden" transmits on 190 pages information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but it makes above all the desire to jump into the blue.
Notorious copies were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an urge carst hole (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose baths are filled with alkali-containing water and located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye from the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the vapor swimming pool there is a window from which you can watch the drive on the ski track.
The most exceptional pool design awaits bathers in Long Field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upward shells it damps in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the swimming pool collector raised the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly to heat oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate healing water, which is almost black and whose slurry clamps one on the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a special kind of wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and solar bath in the Czech Bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed land.
The bath, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, was closed.
When Meder threw a look through the rough windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw the wheat growing between the leaves.
On the contrary, the fall was counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three building phases have this bath already behind it; you can discover not only neoroman elements that come from the times of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurical hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of swimming pool acquaintance Iris Meder - and that’s not just because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to blend so many structures into such a great unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, the immersion in the thermal pool is obviously only a side matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank launches the raw materials business
by Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank stop its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the group will then draw consequences.
of Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable according to a study that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to withdraw from this business because it aggravates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in the middle of October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global raw materials stock exchanges pushes prices up – and the banks therefore have a co-duty on the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically targeted against Deutsche-Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials bets were designed to safeguard traders from price fluctuations.
Nowadays, however, most experts agree that the sugar has disconnected from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business is "value to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank on the ground."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international work group is currently investigating the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the examination is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of the Deutsche Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then tell what the consequences it will bring.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even the complete withdrawal.
Ackermann stumbles on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The bet on food prices rising shows drastically how unconscious banks hurt the general good today.”
Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, is now in duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
“No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the group wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman would not change to the supervisory board other than planned.
With a deviation from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible insults he hardly needs to scratch himself - that would ultimately have his successor to do.
Each second would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent believe it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers facilities where food prices are paid.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learn that their bank is engaged in such transactions: Each second would cancel all facilities where money flows into raw materials speculation, according to the survey.
43 percent would advise acquaintances about such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21th House in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 awarded prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and empty.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
If heated by modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, brave swings and new building materials that are typical for the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an appropriate and famous example.
Schwanzers Pavillon was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and fluid steel glass construction.
The building is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus its shoes-like side building in Munich, it was finally internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition building had been placed in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Southern Railway Station after the World Exhibition, rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century was opened - the "20th House" was called it.
But the building was not suitable in spatial and technical terms as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
However, it was used so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has fallen more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21th House" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a luck case in all respects.
The new beginner was Agnes Husslein-Arco, who in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, a art historian with a remarkable career among others in youth as a ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, promptly implemented the reconstruction among politicians and monuments, acquired public funds and private sponsorship funds and fixed the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the painter Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a cafe and a bookstore, and a office house should be built for it.
Strict supervision, small state
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "unhealthy important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions " every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost to generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and its reuse.
At the current rebuilding there were far greater problems: the building was "a energy slider," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber-fortified insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled roofs have been renovated.
Two floors brought room for new use, a reduced light grave between the house and the street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light swinger pavilion.
The original outdoor doors are left, the house is deleted in the old red brown color.
The cinema is exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monument Authority and with a small state.
“Sometimes we had to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Protection Office,” says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the floor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and renovations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It’s hard to have been with the pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story.”
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “reveal a true consciousness.”
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a urban happiness: around the Swiss garden is just the completely newly planned "Central Railway District", with office and residential houses.
And another luck may still happen: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city about a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Railway Plans Winter Crisis Package in Millions
The train has drawn up a crisis plan to prevent crashes in the winter.
The number of employees will be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related outputs and delays, the Deutsche Bahn provides an additional €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper previously, calling on a group-in-house crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of about 300 million euros are planned.
This should ensure better availability of vehicles and rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railways and railways to 16,000 people.
The objective is to release trains up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the operating must be released from snow and ice within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube warned after a summit with the government and the industry of crashes and delays even this winter.
Last winter, the train had significant problems in passenger transport as it lacked reserves, among other things in difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for an approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that they have to check the axes of ICE trains much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axes break in the Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank to pay a million penalty in the US
After the tumult about chief Josef Ackermann comes a new misconduct from the US: the Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giants now also take their past in the United States: the Frankfurter Institute pays in a comparison of $145 million (106 million euros) to resolve disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA claims a whole number of large banks to have caused the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost great value during the financial crisis and crushed the banks with them into the depths.
“We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a German bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank was not guilty of the comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. co-operative banks and hopes in case of fraud to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the resulting billions of damages repaired.
The closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also prejudiced other large banks and in the summer prosecuted JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
These are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on home loans.
When the U.S. Real Estate Blase set up in 2007, this became a threat to a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events have been a few years back, the banks are currently facing a strong wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have raised countless complaints to obtain compensation or investigate errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint.
It accuses 18 large international banks to have exaggerated the two U.S. state real estate funders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion.
Also the Deutsche Bank has to file a complaint to the FHFA, here it is about several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurter compensate for “substantial losses” without indicating an accurate sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as stable and declared to want to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Increases $10 Billion to IBM
Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies will only be poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his opinion about investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a rider blow in the financial world.
As a result, IBM’s IT system can now be called “Sir IBM”.
Buffett has now revealed on the U.S. economic channel CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding, Berkshire Hathaway, has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had still provided good profits.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has long been focused on profitable IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also provides software and advice as well as powerful corporate computers.
But Buffett has been pushing off technology companies so far.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked, for example, at a cargo railway, a smell manufacturer or machinery makers.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to about 80 own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a whole series of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with smart investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
It is a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost untouchable sense of earning money brought him the top name "Orakel of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock increased by one percent.
“Big Blue,” as IBM also calls, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it, together with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to enter.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is encounterable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “blue ideology” that is now re-experienced.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000-2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the Dutch population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this returns a long-thinked ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the revealed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is unpredictable for a long time.
“Is the bloody ideology alive again?” titled the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk”.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the offenders was supposed to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and shows concerns that also German authorities could be involved in the right-radical summit.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted sensibly: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a warning in front of the Brandenburg Gate in the weekend.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had a fixed act of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkish Advertising Agreement.
In joyful colors, it was scored together—as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift to the Fifty" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful connection.
“It begins to die,” says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people were murdered, who paid taxes and with their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critical is discussed in the Turkish internet forums the actions of the police and their subsequent findings.
Why the German authorities were not much more concerned about searching for suspects in extreme-right circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them show themselves at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: “If here will continue to blame, there is nothing else left for the migrants than self-defense and weapons.”
This will be the best self-protection.”
“On the kindness of education and the adequacy of punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany,” Selen writes.
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s revealed.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply inherited in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is an imminent threat, and to the Germans that uncertainty and distance can go into right-wing violence.
However, the attacks strengthened the sense of we on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was worried at that time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire, he sent a greeting letter to the Turkish president, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Cologne sadness ceremony - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many taxes the Turkish people made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the uncertainty of many foreign turks in the state of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts to enlarge and re-evaluate the extreme-right terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since gone from a crisis to the next.
Now it is a German.
That’s what Axel Weber did not think.
After his spectacular withdrawal from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced in July that he would start a as spectacular new job in 2013: the chairman of the Swiss Bank UBS - an unexpected and profitable career step.
Axel Weber pleased publicly, praised Switzerland if its beauty and the UBS if its newly gained solidity and left friendly comments about the future colleagues fall.
“The UBS has achieved the turn round.”
“I look forward to cooperating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
But in September it was clear that everything would be different.
A trader of the UBS in London had broken all the bank’s security systems and sacked about €1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland famous banker, had to go.
UBS’s board chairman has since been regarded as attacked – and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
Weber will be allowed to consult the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairman of the board already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It’s hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and a notary banker, and he would have had a time to work.
With a blow, he then takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proven that it has long been winning the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because, on the one hand, the UBS is enormous – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager – and on the other hand, it has plunged from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank saved.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the hidden and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very big figure in investment banking as well.
In 2007, UBS, on the one hand, managed $1.6 trillion more money-powered customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world’s largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later long-year banking professor in Zurich, tells us: “My students I always assigned the UBS as a pattern of a good bank.”
From today’s perspective, one asks himself, “How could I just be wrong?”
He was very wrong.
In 2007 it was revealed for the first time that something belonged to the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chairman Peter Wuffli returned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally genius banker.
A few months later, they realized why he had gone.
The bank’s investment party had shut down with subprime papers and had to deposit billions.
To overcome this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of sage and wrote 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but those, over which some would have been throwing the nose until a short time ago: an untransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so hidden that one could not even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, the board chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second most paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood before the collapse due to its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for hundreds of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Coalition gave six billion francs for a forced exchange debt through which it could become a co-ownership of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times the performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We could not save the UBS again,” says Geiger, a bank researcher.
The first catastrophe was the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared ready to disclose the data of wealthy customers who had possibly undertaken taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a refund of unjustified profits from these shops as well as a punishment.
Thus, the UBS said more or less openly that it has helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secret.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the chairman and chairman of the board.
The exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to the fault of speculation and in asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it became a little more quiet again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back, there follows this unpleasant trader story: A single trader gets 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something goes off.
And it becomes obvious: with the risk management in investment banking it is obviously not yet successful.
“With the Adoboli case, one has to find that the risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: “The UBS’s problem is that it doesn’t control the risk.”
But it was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had committed a long time ago to become the guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too big risks, therefore security for the money — the world would once collapse even beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks have become the symbol of untouchable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for noble chocolate.
The UBS’s headquarters in Zurich is still fit to the cliché of the damned Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic already.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snow-covered heights of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany’s can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank through the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear.
You can enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy gateway.
Inside the walls are marble-covered, in front of them are thick leders, next to the bank logo a big sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, at some point withdrawn - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he, like all Swiss bankers, also does business with the two large banks.
The UBS has become too big, he finds – especially in investment banking, where the business asses would have expanded.
The Switzerland had nothing to say.
“And if so, they have long adapted to the seeds of the Angel Saxons.”
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, first protects its high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008 the catastrophe became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue action in its nation's history," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros were granted to the politicians to save the bankrupt bank.
How could it come to that?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined into a huge group.
A bank was formed, which was too big for the small Switzerland, and was increasingly growing.
This helped the two different banks of the UBS to complement themselves: a rich but sleepy bank with an emphasis on asset management in Zurich and a poorest but already stronger internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came advantageously to a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 UBS Group Chief, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the high intellectual, smart, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach man who has worked from banking to the top.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
It is tragic,.
Surprising came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the leaders’ meetings, on which group chief Wuffli repeatedly spoke the same word: Goldman Sachs faces the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the world’s most powerful investment bank.
She led the "League Tables", the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That is why the UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some steps have already been successful.
In exchange and stock trading, she played a lot.
However, corporate consultants who were appointed highlighted a weakness: in international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has a gap in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a pre-founded hedge fund invested in U.S. subprime facilities.
It evolved into a huge machine that packed and delivered securities on U.S. mortgage loans – but also retained risks.
Also, when other banks have long sought out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was in flame, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after the other had to go as the attempts to break out were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become the headquarters and are so hard to this day.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has taken away all the nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already one idea: stop with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment banking should be sharply shrinking, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Switzerland was actually thought only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has agreed that he will permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the stage in the mid-1990s.
He has 3,500 seats.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What do you want to make money?
That’s what Axel Weber asks.
Publically, he only says until now that he will first look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
the next year.

Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this precautions: it is not yet clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.

Intelligent crops spread across cities
In many places, seed crops are considered as "problem birds": However, from the cities, high-intelligent animals have long been unable to be distributed, experts say.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: cracks have been a city image for centuries, but in many municipalities, inhabitants complain about the noise and noise of the animals.
There is no solution to the “problem birds” yet.
Seed crops are no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crops symposium in the eastern Fries empty.
There experts from all over the federal territory report about possible outputs.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The problems in cities also led to the land escape of protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and the fall of typical grapes made the birds life difficult.
The crops are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 brut pairs are among others in the western Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass murder of crowns in the district had provided negative signals.
Critics have called the catching of the animals in bird holes and the shooting with buttons as brutal.
“The normal departure, the departure, does not bring anything,” said urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often has unwanted consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals disappear, large colonies divide and spread to other places.”
Growth is only possible as an exception to hospitals, pensions or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surroundings the problem would not be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
It is thoughtable to be a combination of grabbing the animals from sensitive residential areas and lock offers to resettle them elsewhere.
In contrast, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different treatment of the animals: “A pickel in the face we can ultimately best suffer with self-confidence.”
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, on which indicators inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crops.
The project is already accepted by tourists.
Also to criticize the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds not only use help to get to a snack but also make their tools as help even themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seeds how far the birds’ intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a armor to the fall with stones to get to a motten larve.
Without a lot of training, they realized intentionally what size and shape a stone needs to have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the pfiffic crops then had to solve a more tightening problem.
In a cornered cylinder, the researchers had placed a small edge with a motten larve.
With the snabber the birds could not reach their beats.
However, the researchers had placed them wire pieces.
From it, all four animals formed a hake, with the help of which they then put the amber on their hand out of the rubber.
Three of the four seeds even succeeded in this.
Cristiano Ronaldo to shoot Portugal at the 2012 World Cup
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Leaded by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal hit Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive EM participation perfect after the 0:0 out of the match.

No more burning left Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a milder 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) achieved the next hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed handhole meter (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65) had shortened for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already failed in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a start by measure.
Ronaldo was hunting for a freelance from about 30 meters to early leadership in the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his high-quality and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance through Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City placed a headball on the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek to meet for the Czech Republic
Then the judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Criminal Area, Stark decided to scratch and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial handle meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
However, after the break, the 2004 Vice-European champion made everything clear with four meetings.
Peter Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth consecutive European Championship in 1976.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a shock second in the initial stage.
Finisher Petr Cech prevented with a reflection in the last moment a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest chances when the duo was Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotating from the penalty room limit just shortly on the gate of Cech.
After the break the square had to save for the already hit world-class tour of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had dropped (50).
The gate shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to make sure his place in the bank of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croats can be happy to participate in a fourth round of the World Cup.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even dive the dealer in the gate.
After the shock second, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in operation.
Trapattoni goes to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already provided for a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the match, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) was a guest.
Ireland pushed at the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last minute the Estonian team prevented the possible leader.
In the 32nd minute it was so.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horrors: A Story of the First World War, Tales in Nine Fate" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip how to do this: Cut this page carefully and make it your reading mark.
And these main characters will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you are lost like English men and women in the cloud of war and your illusions are stolen.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which appoints the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains just a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are little ambassadors, raping reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about how it was.”
"Beauty and Horrors" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unknown men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girls and botanics to mountains, doctors, ambulance drivers and office staff.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get crazy or die.
Each of these lives flakes up like the voting candles in one church, some come to, while others destroy.
The English book is different from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea that the First World War was just the stunning position war on the West Front.
"Beauty and Horrors" travels with expert views on other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bees, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsete flights are an unresolved problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells of Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears fire from a distance.
Who comes at all?
Almost no one understands what is happening or why this war is conducted at all.
“Lacking facts,” says Englund, “make up with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alpine dreams and rumors.”
"Beauty and Horrors" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German marine.
Their stories were taken mainly from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be scary or captivating, but they are extremely alive in the anglunds of the detail-lossing assembly of little moments.
Many of them act from lack and support.
In the story of a German schoolwoman, he tells us: “Ersatz, everywhere substitute.”
“Rezerved coffee, false aluminum, false radar rubber, paper bonds, wooden rubber.”
He tells us more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "the meat made of pressed rice and packed in hammer flour (and last served with a false bone of wood), the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, the shoes that were dried with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food supplements allowed in the manufacture of corns, 511 registered coffee supplements."
Some stories are of honor and courage.
One American recognizes his own desire for wildness and tells about war: "You feel that this is, despite everything, what was more intended for men than to sit in a leather chair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to do as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind his own strengthened and captured shirt."
On the contrary, a British soldier acknowledges that he is likely to die and no one will notice or take care of it.
“When you take a distance from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens in front of a audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as horrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old falling Europe and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,” writes Englund, “a war between the factory.”
He begins the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiarium of the youngest century”: “the word wrapped and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the measure that kills while he sits behind a desk.”
People behave in an unexpected way, and there is as terrible behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to attack a prostitute with a sexual illness to escape the front service.
“The grotesque expression of it can be discovered in the trade with gonococcus eders, because soldiers bought and smelled on their genitals in the hope of coming to the hospital,” he writes.
"Those who were really desperate cried him in the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Anglunds’ poetry becomes smoothly and nevertheless irresistible and fits perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war “developed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Anglunds Band joins an unconventional celebration hall.
His book has the most devastating end I’ve ever read in a book.
I don’t give it anymore.
But it’s as if he had scratched us with his book this page with the main characters in front of the nose and burned it with a straw tree.
After a early failure, a thoroughly planned breakthrough
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
We had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday because at that time few people are in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others initially believed to take part in an exercise.
Police Chairman Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence emphasized the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the decennium and gave the houses an enormous increase in public sympathy, could no longer be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officers had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A catastrophic exercise took place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officers strengthened the so-called chaos training – measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to get into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the orders, what he said about a declaration as "exercise".
“The few police officers who were involved, I know, didn’t know it was about the Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
“The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort.”
One reason for the secret was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clean the park, but then fled back when hundreds of protesters gathered after they had learned about these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including operating commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officers, which are usually employed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in the park enter and leave, almost like pendler, so 1 hour in the night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lights and speakers were ready before departure on the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded news from the speakers seemed to scare many protesters.
As public officials entered the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left the place.
Police said there would be no tables until 1:45 to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the surrounding area to interfere if arrestations in the park were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the police chairman, said this had been done for their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to prevent them from watching the police actions in the park. and they said the dealing with officials was very bad.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved to the west by the great disgrace of the protesters’ personal stuff, including suitcases, art races and suitcases with clothes, they followed the city cleaning staff, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were thrown out. pictures of this appeared shortly later on the internet.
A main core of protesters referred to near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrestations.
Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the camp are bound to their arms.
And two people chained themselves into trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officers were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until around 3:30 p.m.
According to the police, the process was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrestations were, as he said, due to "unreasonable behavior and resistance to a detention."
The most prominent officer at the site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “no guided the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
For the case that they should access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the circle more and more around the Zuccotti Park.
On one place, several officials, many of them with protective sheets, were observed to pull people out.
About 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street a protestant jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters left the air out of the roof of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of closed wood.
A police officer and a protestant arrived at the hospital.
Trade Unions will file a complaint against the city for dismissal
The trade union, which represents hundreds of schoolworkers who lost their jobs last month, plans to prosecute the city on Wednesday, as dismissals due to their inappropriate impact on the schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last option that the trade union, district council 37, is still open in its efforts to withdraw the dismissals.
Six hundred twenty-six school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid employees and lost their work on October 7 in a chess train described the trade union leader as a political revenge for the city’s last year’s refusal to access a health fund, which the working groups discussed, with which the budget disaster should be closed.
These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing from the council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month, the dismissals were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget would specify that staff of the school aid would be dismissed.
Office 37 officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the submission of the complaint to the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be officially announced.
The complaint will be filed by Mr. Walcott and the city’s Ministry of Education as accused and eight dismissed workers are counted as prosecutors who are all colorful or Latin American women, like most of the assistants who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Ministry of Justice, said the city is not presenting the claim and therefore its individual claims cannot be commented.
According to a lawsuit presented to the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of dismissals in the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a lawsuit for inequality. it claims that poor schools would have lost more helpers as they were chronically underfinanced.
She suggests that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only a few dismissals in the schools of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 assistants in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx have been dismissed.
With the detection of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of poor parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year.In addition, funds were lost as the city changed its method of calculation for the extrafinancing for each armed school enrollment.
The trade union also complains that the high school leaders were guided through the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the U.S. usually describes the shift of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
“Six-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not overturned,” the complaint proposal says.
Mission Ends, Congress Ready to Deal on Libya
In the end, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing about the Rebellion in Libya.
All that was needed to do this was the success of the revolts, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate adopts a resolution submitting to the Chairman John Kerry (Massachusetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "must".
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to restore their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties.”
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer lawmakers of both parties and the White House discussed the vote of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the U.S. military in the NATO’s Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution approving the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide edge group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, the law was passed in the Senate, and the Chamber also voted on a decision to cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission went into a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that, although it was up enough to criticize Obama's behavior within the mission, but not angry enough to ultimately pull the ground off under his feet.
Then the uncertainty of Congress was overwhelmed by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “ congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-release” and “lobes the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reaffirms “the U.S. national interests in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Authority or will they divide the legislators, as the law of June has done?
The final version faces the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is in the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congressional legislation period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area that comes at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to try to bring their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatt’s amendment is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both the Congress and the Senate - others are just slightly apart from each other.
Only in the Senate there are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors—especially beginners among the Republicans who want to poll their CV—the opportunity to praise with the fact that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to repeal the limitation to two term of the president.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among homosexuals, as well as a change that prohibits burning flags, is a repeated proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to enable the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of states refuse them.
The more desirable as the members propose changes, the more unevenly faster they move as in the past years.
In the 111th Congress, the lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The rate is downward compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers that the Senate Library provides.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Found but not defeated," Giffords said in his first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot them from a near distance during a election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday night on national television. She singed alone for the Broadway song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover is greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20", she ran after words and needed help in walking.
The transmission showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the ball, which divides its neck, passes through the left side of its brain and passes through its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly give her voice to the debt barrier.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, “Go well.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the new book of the couple was published: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special is pursuing Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In the videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you see her in the hospital bed, with a kahl rased head and a long shell over her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nicot with the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then, their first words: “What.”
After a few days, Giffords flies another word: “Toast.” She wants her breakfast to be changed.
The videos on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You see how Congressmen together with the therapists sing Cyndi Laupers' "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said that she can’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he had read Gifford's article on the assassination on March 12, when she broke down it and first asked for the six people who were killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medical while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” Gifford’s Sawyer said.
“Hard, hard and hard.”
During his wife’s recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, “I was hit.”
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you didn't get defeated?'" Kelly said.
You were only met.
And you will survive it and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
People feel more compassion than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gallery that gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a key word, hundreds of soldiers, matroses, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the donation operation in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by Staff Chief and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers said it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really no. It was compassion.
The crazy contradictory impressions illustrate the harsh relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are praised for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they do people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims in any way," Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland said, who commissioned troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support them is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unacceptable or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger against the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, talks about sympathy in the silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would see them with a sense of fear as they defeated rebels and had travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high-level state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtilly asked if he was able to resist the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the struggle.
“When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of military ease is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
The accomplishments on the battlefield are rarely issued as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commissioned U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mostly on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces increasing pressure for harsh interference in rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-interference in a rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of prosecutors are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her castles in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked if he could take her to a drink in her room.
“My alarm clocks went,” Lyman said.
But the texanist wiped her concerns away.
I thought, “Oh what, he’s 19.
He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I had heard about my stomach feeling.”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman's room, the man stood behind them, pushed them down and rape them, she claims.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are afraid to attend a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a lawsuit they have raised against the former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be approved before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February submitted by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 prosecutors, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming they were rape or sexually abused by soldiers' colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide an appropriate jurisprudence after alleged attacks.
Burke says he follows the highest military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically built,” she says.
“Who are the individual persons who are in the position to eradicate the culture of reward?
Burke also says it has contacted more than 400 survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all complaints to say put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Defence Ministry, led by federal lawyer Neil MacBride, has filed a request to reject the complaint.
The court documents, which are available on Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that it has occurred in the armed forces.
According to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries caused by active servicing soldiers.
“The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the prosecutors,” the document says.
The Ministry of Defense rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not yet permitted to serve in the battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in war areas.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers were killed, two-thirds of them in combat operations.
It is time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other complaints other than her are continuing.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a lawsuit against the four major military academies for alleged promotion of a female hostile atmosphere.
Independently from this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America raises a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" who received rape victims to release them from service - a common procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Their group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the Administration of War Veterans) in December, in which they alleged their discriminatory practices in their dealing with benefits for persons alleged to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were independently submitted to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of points of view.
According to the Ministry of Defense’s Office for the Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office), 3,158 sexual abuses were in 2010.
However, most abuses are not at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this number takes into account approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The prosecutors in the Burke case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commander.
She had a rape seat and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people expressed their character in the name of the alleged criminal, who was eventually released.
“I still remember the day when the judgment was read,” Lyman says.
“I thought the wings would be used. I was screaming out of the court room.”
“They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came back, I said to my commander, ‘This was not his procedure.
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it unemployed.
She was dismissed in January 2010 so she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaint that Lyman and the other prosecutors have filed is a pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, “I think they should go ahead.”
What is between them and a judgment is this doctrine that is criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military goes a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same disgrace that a responsibility brings with them.
He adds, “The chances are against them... but it’s important for them that they try it.”
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the prosecutors, will start with its hundreds of other prosecutors for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who claimed to have committed a bullying in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have handled alone, he is far from alone in the cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack in front of his computer and chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme-right groups on the sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It’s easy – you just need to log in to Facebook.
“We found it was not difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report by the British Idea Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of extreme-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the adds invited users to a survey that asked about their educational status, their attitude to violence and their own future assessment.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and colleagues were able to interrogate more than 10,000 supporters from 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries – without having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new method of research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. online supporters of extreme right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factory, medical researchers and policy scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content a day, Facebook’s “Datensupernova” generates a research boom that has made the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title increase by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people that you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
“When you tried to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“They had to inform the party first and it would never give them access,” says Bartlett.
“In Facebook, it’s all gone – you’re going straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and colleagues found that students who discussed their full-rush on Facebook were significantly more likely to be problematic than students who silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you don’t recognize it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle to the Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify threatened children that would not have been found otherwise.”
Facebook is also constantly accessing the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics about the relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Happiness Index (which primarily used data that only Facebook has access to - Masters of Digital Freedom have long known that the site should make its large database available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the page is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to bring out your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online everything is permitted.
"I don't think that many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he explored the public pages of students on Facebook.
“It was just about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Thus, despite his years as a tech researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of the social – and a lot of social life still takes place offline.”
"Cold and unhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who held two strikes in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider of Norway," he said in a court hall with more than 500 people.
“I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because this supports multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "will not give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who delivered a pre-write speech, the permission to refer to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that police keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. he said the authorities will check all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he was behind the castle and the roof.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything went out to a closure.
“I thought he seemed cold and unhuman,” a survivor of Utoya told Norway’s NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark dress and a blue cravat and seemed quiet and professional throughout the hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he would be part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not a mental ill and said there was no evidence that he had had complications.
Some may think that the July 22 attacks seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But will this automatically relieve the sadness and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
“I wanted him to look like a monster, but he doesn’t do that,” the victim’s family said.
“It would be much easier if he did it.”
7 lessons from the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs showed this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the tech genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find the most insightful in the newly discovered job interview, which was overwhelmed this week before special film performances on the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was a designer, a dreamer, and a well-known hippie, but he was also an acrylic organizer who was thirsty to charts - a man who believed that many managers suffer from a "thinking disease" that "a really great idea represents 90% of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialist Idiots" about the rise of the Personal Computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years have passed since Jobs from Apple had been pushed. And he already worked hard at his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copying templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Just after Jobs’ death, a full VHS copy was found in the director’s garage.
This lightly revised film material is the foundation for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly desirable here in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of feedback, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the day when he appears to be impatient to answer Cringely’s questions and pushes him to engage faster in topics or subjects of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow unhappy when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right or wrong in their opinion and represents their own vision of the future of the computer.
But seeing jobs here as the desirable dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
“Thro the years in business I always ask, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answer you always get is, ‘Oh, that’s how it’s easy to do.’
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize accounting at Apple.
Surprising how costs were recorded - mostly started with "standard costs" that were referred to on a simple assumption and then adapted with "divergence" - he developed an automated factory that secured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was saved:
Jobs tells us about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could connect to the telephone company and conduct remote conversations free of charge.
A lot has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-confidence is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a payable phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while passing through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you go to the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next,” Jobs tightened.
“We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control billions of dollars on infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think it would be Apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strip that Wozniak and he had almost taken away when they called in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were able to follow Henry Kissinger as well.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency count, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call, Jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I had seen in the age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some plates, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer together.
He worked with a payment period of just 30 days and had to reflect on both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember striking arguments... They shouted to me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Nine days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
About large companies that decline:
Long before he resuscitated Apple, Jobs saw the ways on which so many industry giants with their visions broke down and lost control over their shares.
“Let’s say you’re working with IBM or Xerox, so you’re making a better copy or printer, well and well?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is devastated by the people who do not have a concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened with Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
If one could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been the 1990s.
You gained the defeat from the victory.
Innovation as an Art Form:
“There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtles.
You have to make votes, certain things you can’t, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together.
In the end, it goes out to the taste, it goes out to the fact that one tries to divide with the best thing that man has created, and then tries to bring these things together to what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists clay.
We are always shy in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws, as the court adopts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically partial question of whether an objection to President Obama’s health laws will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the chancellor that will represent the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to advise on the petitions to be examined.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint that 26 states have filed against the extensive health reform approved last year by Congress, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to boost the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full course at the time the court's decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will claim that the law is to be cracked will probably be Paul Clement, a former general lawyer under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement’s office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies supporting the Federal Society’s annual dinner, an old-seated group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who oppose the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially enormously involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
He served, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican party in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events of law and other organizations, where the judge may not be a spokesman, honorary guest or, according to the program, no guest of such events."
However, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the channels associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alarm moral and government activists.
“This amazing breach of morality and the contradiction to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lies, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
“The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with sliding proceedings at the court.”
Your appearance and support for a donation action for this event undermines any right to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration to critics who say they would mix judicial affairs too easily with groups that can be led by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the contrary, the conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor under the Obama administration when the first first law enforcement appeared before the court.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of prejudice, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be unfair.
Kagan does not make any installations to do this.
Boeing takes $18 trillion record order to land
Emirate will order 50 Boeing 777 two-layer aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order of more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is at a record amount of $18 trillion.
Similarly unusual is the contractor of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 trillion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order of all time for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 double-layer Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammera order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline has also, according to Boeing announced it at the Dubai Air Show in 2011, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar stock executive.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.”
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
Instead, an increase in oil prices, which usually damages airlines, as this is one of their greatest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or delay aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural assurance,” he said.
The Emirates order confirms Boeing’s lead position on the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus’ competitor SAS in shock, attacking the position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aircraft show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher usage load and reach.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug trader has supported opponent Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her candidacy for the post of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. she claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won by the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, the race for the governor's positions in the western state.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our staff in the surveys...They occupied electoral cabins, built street blocks...and commissioned people to vote for the PRI.”
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are looking for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have just hit Claderon, which had led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother’s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to the third place, a serious defeat for the split and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that have specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have gone out of the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reverse the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidency race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will let us boldly look to the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will hinder the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the administrative director of the ADB based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who look “less passionate” to the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in the same boat.”
“So everyone is helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
“If China and India can help, then with all the means.”
The European Monetary Union has suffered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have grown dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have withdrew.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe raises concerns that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries should join together to support the euro area.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia will be channeled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) - will provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drought of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a task, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the wealthy Europeans if they are faced with major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India aid to Europe, of which more than 800 million of $2 or even less live a day.
“At some point they will find out that the Greeks with 50 go in retirement and spend holidays on the beach, then you have a problem,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid employees in public service, with jobs in poorly managed, losing facilities such as railway.
Mr. Nag said the crisis in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB forecast with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/this is now threatening the “risk of decline” due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable threshold markets should create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital emigration of their outlook.
Pentagon warns of possible interference in defence
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that automatic budget cuts would undeniably weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war sites in Afghanistan and the civilian flows.
The Pentagon is already thinking about $450 trillion cuts over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress can’t get an end to the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to the so-called cessation, would lead to 23% general cuts as well as a stop of numerous new projects.
"Every high reduction, carried out in such an unthinkable way, would make most of our ships and construction projects irrealizable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to unvoluntaryly separate ourselves from a majority of our civil staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to reserve civilians with a limited probability to the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert willingness.”
The cuts were eventually hit by the troops," Panetta said.
"While the war time quotas in the anti-Terror struggle are not directly affected by the capture, the serious intervention in the basic budget would negatively affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
“Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in settings and settings surveillance that support the war.”
“The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to war-time merchants and the legal and political support would be disturbed.”
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Ministry.
“The consequences of the deployment of the Ministry of Defense would trigger the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are strongly against this drakonic act,” the Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's not one that you should push us."
“The arrest is a threat to the United States’ national security interests and their entry should not be allowed.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings of the Senators will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to remove the Pentagon from cuts, it remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a dark picture of what could be ahead - a military with shell but without a core.
“It’s a ship without matroses.”
“It’s a brigade without munitions.”
“It’s an aircraft shooter without sufficiently trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper, an army of casinos, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
“It’s a struggle power that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to deal with potential enemies.”
“It makes you really angry.”
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta revealed new details on how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity and intervention, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said that some of the greatest defence projects could fall to the victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter that the army and the Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were stopped, it would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but the supporters say it is an important next step towards upgrading, so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
How to Discover a Lies
A look at the current tracks shows how questionable and widespread misconduct and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of misconduct as it is alleged that it has kept reports that a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shock countries.
New York's Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became foolish when he brought out denials that were very quickly rejected by untouchable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating campaign financing, which is linked to the depletion of an out-of-family affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it will forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second office.
Stories about shells in school and at college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers predicted their students the examination responses so that they were well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fools are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered as emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important to learn for every person, and this for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as sharades, in which it is intended to call "Have you!" the source of a misconduct is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out extensive research projects, in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been disclaimed.
The lies look in one’s eyes.
They don’t always stumble, stumble, stumble and stumble.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these liars are difficult to uncover and disguise.
A practiced liar tanner can penetrate into the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the subtle expressions of the face, about questioning and timing.
I’ve spent several years investigating the scientific findings of the comprehensive and constantly growing field of entarnation. And it’s clear that the source of fraud is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding justice in our complex world, especially when setting or questioning people or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in appreciating other people, awakening their interest and mastering their own emotions. and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more frequently “self-oriented” lies than women whose lies are more “oriented to others” – usually they want to protect the feelings of others – that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly “fat lies”).
We also know that when a person is disguised as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty to have lie to that person.
How do you know if someone lies?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called “baselining”, the starting position.
It provides a reference to the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughter, the voice quality of your person.
You should better know when someone normally trips constantly with the foot so that they don’t wrongly accuse him if he trips with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to the attachments of noticeable verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these calls as alarm clocks that scream, not as proof of an entarnation.
Per they point their feet towards the door or they tend toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "tension after the setting conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often false signal that a settlement conversation is over, only to keep looking after this relaxation after the settlement conversation.
Also pay attention to the language of your person.
Scott Peterson's shooter is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed his murdered wife is still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Cheating people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman...Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a crazy question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use “qualified language” when they answer a narrow question: “Now... to tell you the truth... to the extent I know... according to the best knowledge and conscience.”
Through this, the answer becomes more perceivable than factual, which often causes the alarm clocks to scream.
There is no magic means to get the fountain of lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which an entarnation is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can rarely become the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
A controversial oil pipeline plan is reviewed after threat due to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which harshed the trade unions and at the same time calmed the environmental workers, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-planning the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building in Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, though with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be made until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may take a decision until 2013, after the next year’s elections, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was linked to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
The pipeline must pass through six countries.
Environmental workers hate them, but labour markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska, who are opposed to the plan, revoke the laws to force a withdrawal from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and watering.
The current study on the environmental impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry’s main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, is in an interest conflict.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing a little boy from fear to burn
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle had received a smoking attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have made her little daughter so scared that she had surrendered from fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a nurse, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby in her building on the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, 'You know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes', and went to take her back on the arm,' she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You should not put your daughter near the door,' Roseanna Monk said.
I said, “I don’t care what you say or think.”
She became angry and began to cheat - she used the word F and the word A and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done with my daughter,’ the child’s mother said.
LaBelle fell to the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her accompaniment and moved to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family apologized in writing but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting a comment.
The complaint is on a not closely specified compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he didn't charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to child cancer aid.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed on the day against a nurse who is wearing a 18-month-old baby on the arm."
Climate Disadvantages Boost the Economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments dropped and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in memory in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year when Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and shed great hopes regarding economic growth, is at the government. However, as a result of climate contradictions, growth cannot be spoken, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also closed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter of the year.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (so-called the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frozen, 582,000 hectares of agriculture land have been damaged, of which 78,03 percent have been completely destroyed and the remaining 21,07 percent have been partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led the unemployment to continuously rise in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografia observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 per cent of the occupational population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74.000 unemployment in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter of the year.
Lower liquidity
The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, among other things with liquidity losses on the market as a result of the funds cut by the legislation that was adopted to fight money laundering in Congress, because for those who prohibitedly buy dollars, it's not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has dropped. this is due to the problem of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which causes unemployment to rise,” he says.
The black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if we take into account the high percentage of black labour, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of the workers in the country who work without paying in the social insurance funds.
Unemployment and black labour are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to statistics by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexican Government Agency for Labour and Social Care).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 Pesos until September; this is much less than the national average, which is at 7375 Pesos.
The decline of ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) is recorded in the last ten years. According to Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), the ADI was from January to June 630 597 dollars, which is a swing of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, primarily from companies from the third-party sector.
The debt
In light of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to the National Congress in July, which should be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship the first year of government made Mario López Valdés government inability obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Processing Industry in Mexico) said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
“The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very thin this year. it has to be hard to work to recover the lost land this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. the efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-defined government team have not been sufficiently agreed with each other,” he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said events such as the cold at the beginning of the year complicated and slowed the country’s economic development.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frozen. One of the main impacts is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to trigger an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services.
Re-defining the appeal
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Commercial Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said it is necessary to drive the state to more dynamic productive activities.
We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to re-definit the economic appeal and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloas,” he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex emphasized the importance of developing a future perspective that will lead the government’s efforts to better routes.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in different areas. economic development has advanced, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He emphasized that the current state power has made progress with the government.
“There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more comprehensive. what I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it,” he said.
Arrested for 8 kg marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor's Office of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana intended for trade.
In accordance with Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by Mexican soldiers in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez street in front of the Watchpoint No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer was driving in a white car where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were transferred to the district judge and the punishment remains in the executive court.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants planned in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs run a danger of not being completed due to the lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban authority for social development said that although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger as the state government has not paid the funds in its possession, which exceeded 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said the total investment in these three programs is 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. until now only the Federation and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is over, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state has failed to fulfill its obligations, which is why the municipality at the beginning of its government period had to accept a loan of 7 million.
“This had happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. the programs continued and this year we had to get the resources that the state had not spent on to participate in these programs,” he said.
Although the government authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was asked to accelerate the administrative work and pay the remaining share as soon as possible.
“They have to pay $12 million, and although the year is over, they don’t give us a penny.”
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, and in accordance with which the transition of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be passed, due to the lack of eight votes required to object to the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the opinion that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the law decree with the details on the transition to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the proposal for the complaint, which was drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the legislative decree unconstitutional, as for which the radio and television regulations are responsible for the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), therefore the legislative decree would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the legislative provisions.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the House of Representatives raised constitutional complaints against the bill. After the complaints were accepted, the Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied to the bill and introduced all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the appeal submitted by the House of Representatives, without participating in the debate on the project, for which also the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his post, the Prime Minister stated not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government cannot regulate by general regulations the measures that the public administration is intended to take.
"I also don't think that if you do so, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body." she also reminded that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central state government is responsible, because it is the head of state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred throughout the world in recent years, and it leads to a better use of the radio spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The suspension of the transformation, she said, is a suspension of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security technical aspects."
These matters, she emphasized, "have made the action of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state they contained a group of characteristics that put the constitution in the hands of the central state government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already undertaken the digital transformation through the government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
"It cannot be concluded that the government would interfere in Congress' competences by issuing the contested law decree because the laws adopted by the legislative would be respected," she said.
The possibility of counting the voting cards in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the Governor is about 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still not elected.
The possibility of the individual counting of the votes is a reality this year at the Michoacán elections, since according to the data issued by the Program de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is about 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 still not counted.
In this regard, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that just last November 9 the Electoral Bureau had adopted a series of arrangements to harmonise local regulations with the federal reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel refused to publish it in the state declaration within the deadlines set forth with the argument, neither having objection to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional draft submitted by the local legislative and judged the prosecutor's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" as he has no right to "decision or veto against it."
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview on the possibility of the individual counting of the votes that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM now there is the possibility that the local electoral authority can count the voting numbers partially or entirely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the counting and calculation of the votes is not present or is not in possession of the chairman of the voting committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
Furthermore, the total calculation of the fully completed election scenes can take place if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the second place, which is equal or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting is present an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the listed candidates.
The vote count can also be made in its entirety if, after completion of the regular calculation, the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate on the second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is presented by a representative of the party whose candidate has become the second.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is just 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ash will be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rushed this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace.
According to family members, the ultimate will of the supreme prince was that his ash would spread over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others killed in the crash, returned to a Mexican Air Force aircraft to the capital of Coahuila.
At twelve a.m. the ash of the Supreme Leutnant landed on the sad hall on the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, and where the family members and friends came.
At 17.30 a.m. his remains were investigated at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This body show was caused by his former colleagues from the Technical Graduate School and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the Graduate School.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ash would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains. he had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, in a statement.
From her point of view, the Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he has stood in the abundance of his life. ”He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family.”
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the air force school of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not realize it because they thought it would even swindly him on a truck. However, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His cousin Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. “He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as in the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo.”
The young man remembers that he had even been driving to Zapopán at the age of seven to graduate his family member. Therefore he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
The Last Goodbye
His honor was awarded to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Territory, the Mexican Air Force, the head of school and student of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985, and both in studies and in sports as excellent.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter crashed, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were sitting.
At 18.05 the seized remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, gathered to be transferred to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the front square of the castles, where he was already awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, sisters and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned body was found on a property in the Cadereyta NL.
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shooting in different parts of the body and a gunshot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the 1.5 km point of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several temporaries saw the door of the landhouse surrounded by a beige-brown wall standing up.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, and they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, wearing a white top.
A few meters away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information obtained on the site, the three people must have been murdered in another place, as no patron hole was found.
On the wall of the countryside there are inscriptions to read that one organized crime band writes to another, in addition several inscriptions were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a crime that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who were linked to kidnapping, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funeral.
According to the public information, eight people were first arrested in the settlement of Los Alveros on November 11th and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were saved. the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 p.m. on their watch round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, soldiers found a car with two inhabitants.
During the inspection of the car, the soldiers found a long weapon, a charging machine and 18 patrons.
Later, on November 13, at 14.00 a.m., one of her comrades was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military saw it.
You will be placed in secret submissions in the locations of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present him the new government that is intended to face the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present him the new government that is intended to face the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Sunday appointed Monti would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is predicted that he will represent a majority of technocrates' cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government to the president.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not expressly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
“The frame is now well covered,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than usual. At the same time, Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has brought the costs for the debt to an unbearable amount.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to adopt a hard savings package that was asked by European politicians to restore the trust in Italy.
The pressures on Monti increased further due to the fluctuating market situation, which resulted in a 10-year interest rate on Italian government bonds, which corresponds to the state in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue scheme.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government with all the strengths."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis' chances of success were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are aimed at bringing good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the mid-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is crucial, since so far many of its members have expressed themselves against a majority of the technocrates government, which is now formed by Monti.
Support from Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpublished savings.
Resistance to its efforts or the delay of reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks practices with its indication that a Montis failure is a catastrophe, also pressure out.
Monti began on Monday with debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial associations as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
The meeting will be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid government change as a response to the crisis.
After short breaks at the end of last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the costs for the Italian government bonds have reaching critical boundaries.
A rescue of Italy with a state debt of €1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU rescue scheme.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the forecasts that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate politicians into his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist of only technicians, a sign of their concerns in view of the process imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual uncertainty and the disagreements between the parties make the involvement of persons from the political life complicated.
Spanish players have more opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten of them have over 50 international games on the buckle.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 invited 50 games is behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game, which will take place today at 15.05 in the San José National Stadium, will be compared with players from both countries.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of class A selection games, the three-colored team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number he reached on Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Championships) as well as high-ranking Europacups such as the Champions League.
Additionally, the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated exclusive games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Tico footballers, however, have few international meetings in the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls their last record: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign matches reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain has a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberic team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the midstormers of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number 100 is also close to Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side storm is Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm is Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Playing with the least.
Less than 30 games are played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 matches Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even reach the 20th border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had their debut not yet.
The historic port of Spain is David Villa with 50 meetings, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most gates with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary of existence
“To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is realised.”
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to show one of their best concerts on Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will appear at the National Stadium at 19.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an extract from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rica fans, a dream is realised when Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica: Are you aware what it means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realised for us too.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
It’s so beautiful country that we’ll definitely stay there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely abandoned. they experience the days before the concert more intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being on our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to come here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is this not a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve made in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are enthusiastic about the jungle. for this Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been driving to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. together with Mexico are the great areas to surf. in this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a look at the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t put any boundaries.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why ?
I think this is partly because we have nine albums and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play each does not fall easily.
If we take in the repertoire two or three songs that we have not played for a long time, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons why we liked these songs.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes and total.
First of all, I think that no one of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and that’s still over 20 years.
We continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We love each other and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the Grunge’s birthday hour?
It has always been an honor to be a member of this group of big bands.
We are well friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement arises from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out of a city, but it’s unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are glad to still be friends with them all and it is a honor to be part of this emerging Seattle sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) hit us 13 years ago.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate ourselves happy to be alive and also we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, so musical paths have opened, giving every individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. it could not go better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy; on the other hand, thanks to your success you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grow up has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tours too often because it’s too easy to fall into this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come for music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without failing to be a famous rock star.
What are your memories of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died for three years.
We were disappointed about having taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who build the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter whenever you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who was influenced by you as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first ones I think are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I can talk all the afternoon about the basists I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep the Grunge alive even though it’s no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all feel not very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she’s more positive.
Why ?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could seem somewhat lightweight. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
To both came my tears when I heard how Ed played them.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, when you lose a family member or a friend – that will influence your artistic creation and your music and these two songs make it clear to me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.

Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was taken to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs.
The 72 year old Fujimori, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for violations of human rights during his rule (1990-2000), has several diseases, including cancer, who has been operated four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to identify the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower organs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be blessed for humanitarian reasons; however, he did not wish that because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated for cancer four times and he has lost 18 pounds of weight. This includes other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood flow problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been held in the Directorate Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's deadline, which was secretly operating during his rule.
Mujica visits Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official order, led by Uruguay’s President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, begins its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón on Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the peak of his scheduled schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayan people living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American President's Office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking the support of Calderon in the intersection with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as a tax paradise from the international community. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and raised a question to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the chairman of the G20 since November, a group consisting of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrial countries. Since January this year there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double-release with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the specification of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be removed from the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
On the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing trade between the two countries.
The snorkeling installator enters the third dimension with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has been struggling for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the craps of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he struggles for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the loads of the world this month, has been adapted from the beginning to the features of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played three-dimensional without a special glass.
“Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses works,” said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game that has been developed for this console from the beginning" because so far successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of already existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman stressed that, although it’s three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is a “priced” video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" included two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less scared users.
After that, the experts over the different levels of play, which are becoming more and more difficult, can turn a "second round".
In addition, users in real time can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome the obstacles, without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", however, it must always be played three-dimensional.
This Super Marios trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo excites the fans of the saga and repeats the successful recipe of the latest releases: The scary installator has to overcome dangerous platforms to release Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the clothes and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom calls for extradition of Portillos to the United States
Guatemala's president Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would carry out the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
This ends the trial on the U.S. request for the extradition of Portillo so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He emphasized that he did not interfere in court decisions during his government and made all the extradition requests he was informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The procedure Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional courts are exhausted to condemn the former state president (2000-2004) .
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if his legal status in Guatemala is cleared and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the suppression of 120 million Quetzales in the Defence Ministry during his rule. This negotiation was ahead of extradition, but the minister made objection and revived the case again.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without professional education.
The first 25 years of life of the social aid organization Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter century, 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
More than a hundred jobs are created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event took place yesterday in the former Fabra i Coats workshops, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the city district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, unemployed, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
On the celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu participated numerous managers from institutions and institutions that have worked together with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in elections demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove’s work.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former socialist minister of education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and at the time left-green council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is “a good basis.”
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that is white to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulty hope.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he said.
The occupied house, in which giant parties were held, was removed.
The house owners had 11 of the 13 apartments occupied in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve house owners left the building afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the dreams of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the Balmes Street have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they held illegally occupied and in which they had organized enormous parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the cleaning, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
“From now the entry will be checked,” the house manager confirmed.
The housing owners who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical facility and part of the water supply.
In the three lower floors were celebrated enormous parties, which lasted up to two days and pushed the renters to despair.
Beside the building is a discothèque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business would have dropped by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discoteca pointed out that the house owners made her unfair competition because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these in the discoteca cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the recreational room was shown by the neighbors due to rest disorder, while according to her statements the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco but from the house owners and in particular from the guests of the parties that were organized there, and which, according to the annoying neighbors, became more and longer in the last weeks.
The director of the discount said the disturbance was so large that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rental for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbors over the past weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for the building to be cleaned immediately and to get the problems of civil coexistence and the fall of the city district in control.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the house owners had gone forward in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to act against the associate acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the neighborhood of Nou Barris was seized by the Catalan police.
At 15.30 p.m. the police approached the street Montral No. 35, after they had received a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the tender, in addition to the disputes on the honorary.
The city tender over the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its briefing on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in the city of Barcelona.
It was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many back to the upper border of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few that spreads not in the north-south direction, but upward (mountains) and downward (mares).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example now was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogiber.
So far, when the city in September issued a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
It is either that, or someone has the intention to put the gates on the ground.
The question raises itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection about the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It’s already almost a recurrent topic to which two members of this ancient castle, who meet in the elevator, can take advantage.
And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, it is “necessary” to speak over the “front on the mountains” to the extent that the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which is about the green apples, has not been performed.
“It should be based on the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical fall" in itself: one should not "imagine it as access to a park, but as an interference of areas on which it is to be negotiated."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that contains "some dangers" in itself.
Dangers caused by the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "sweeping song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what can be built.
“Limiting something always means setting the next step,” that is, exceeding it.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in relation to the General Metropolitano Plan] can lead to a real catastrophe.”
Modol, who holds closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that doesn't go towards Barcelona", and that's for purely topographic reasons.
Modol reminds that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "touch to the blind ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his staff the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment."
Furthermore, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the lead letter that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" about whether this technical profile should guide the multi-disciplinary teams that are set up ("exactly the right thing," he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex as in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola is lacking: "There were 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of Mountains-Sea.
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the gate architect next to it.
According to him, the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length in such a way that a soft transition between the city and the green areas will be created.
Casino gives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s authority releases Monterrey’s mayor’s brother from the trial against him for alleged persecution.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the authority of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the District's Second Criminal Court, which leads the trial against Monterrey's mayor's brother for persecution.
After the assassination on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is seen, allegedly forcing him to pay a cash amount so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the gambling house.
After the sentence, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panic mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministry Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed in this place 49 days after a second arrest order, after the Ministry Público official had denied the crimes for corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he was alleged to have stolen the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an invader of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was sentenced to prison by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that after the two months of investigation there were sufficient evidence to prove that Jonás was guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Court of Appeal in order to open it in exchange.
On Monday, the authority of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, called for the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to release the punishment, which is why he will be released over the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry Público assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether this has fixed the damage and who of the owner of the court has expressed his forgiveness.
According to the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free of speech. Also in the following cannot be appealed against the proceedings, in addition, no compensation is required.
Following the hearing of the competitor at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he was released and his case would be put to the records.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome has announced details about the plane crash in which government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results on the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed indicate that the helicopter with its entire unreversed structure was shot directly against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller flags had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the rope, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inhabitants, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of staff.
He also said that in the investigations on the area on which the plane was dropped, no helicopter parts were found.
“In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the attack covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inhabitants, so it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a shrinking of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is priority to obtain the results as soon as possible, but they may take several months, maybe even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance in Mexico), assured that the Estado Mayor Presidencial helicopter was flighting at travel flight speed and the aircraft had fallen to a soft hole.
“This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the attack.”
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
View of flight:
In accordance with the flight standards it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight. This means that the crew should have had sufficient vision during the flight and on the ground.
The weather conditions:
The AICM suitable weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some deep hanging clouds emerged.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley due to the clouds.
The explosion:
The explosion coordinates and the ultimate radar recording of the helicopter agree. there may be no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the explosion.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to this time indicates that the helicopter was launched in straight and side direction.
The pattern of the dispersed aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had exploded on the ground with its unreversed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft are not covered for fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest research results indicate several soil contacts.
During the inspections on the site, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The ground is desolate and has a shrinking of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search on a area that crossed the locked area at the accident site, no distant aircraft parts were found, which strengthened the assumption that the unreversed aircraft structure had exploded against the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find the genes for obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is conducting a research project to find the genes for child and youth obesity, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Institute for Social Security of Mexico) announced that it will conduct a research project to discover the genes for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers associated with overweight will be found.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
Interested people can come to the IMSS sporting sites in the Gulf of Mexico, where tests are carried out with children and adolescents every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He emphasized that the investigation began at the Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of Mexico) and will continue since October 8 at the Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 researchers is achieved, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Course (south of the capital district) and will be completed at Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study is to identify the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he said it will be aimed at filling in three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 with the consent and under the supervision of their parents nutritional questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about your physical activity and your family history of illness to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
Furthermore, he concluded that on the aforementioned Saturdays the examining persons were measured (weight, size, range), their blood pressure was controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors were determined (proof of identifying genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López emphasized that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concerns of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the proportion of fat boys increased by 77 percent and the proportion of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He said the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population differs from the other peoples.
He said that a Mexican (in) is an average of 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is influenced by the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was in a comprehensive study of children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin spots in the neck and inside arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information will be treated confidentially and informed the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest them lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in daily life, spending most of the day in front of TV and using transportation, instead of walking short roads.
The high calorie intake, i.e., an increased consumption of sweetened beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics that is intended to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents clashes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the UNAM University of Mexico, has developed polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations.
If attention was paid to the signs that arise from the road cover, it would not be necessary to repair 200,000 shock holes if the rain time in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Mexico Valley City Area) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and assured that if the extraction and maintenance of the asphalt cover is done properly, the number of shock holes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Strailer from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce an asphalt-like mixture, which, however, has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road cover and thus prevent the appearance of shock blows.
He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - is a carbon hydrogen compound, of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes.
The asphaltic behavior means that the asphaltic behavior at high temperatures of almost 180°C acts like a fluid, at 120°C it is very fluid and at 50°C it is almost solid, while it becomes broken at very low temperatures.
“This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations,” the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible road load consisting of six material layers, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the upper layers is a sliding layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalted and then fixed stones.
Each stone of this layer is covered in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer enables a good power distribution in the road load.
“If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed,” the chemical engineer said.
“Over the loading layer,” he said, “there is a last layer, the so-called loading layer, which consists of small stones, i.e. of sand, which was also wrapped in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the welding layer and they need to produce irritation.
The road load receives and distributes the most of the strengths, the cargo layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it consists must be kept.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other, important factors to be taken into account, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the dust layer.
When the ground becomes wet, water penetrates into the layer and only difficult to get out again. This causes a deviation of all layers of the road cover and consequently the appearance of shock holes.
When a hole occurs," he said, "the roof layer will first be dropped, while the slurry layer will only be damaged afterwards. but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be kept up with the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of shock holes. therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road cover must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be guaranteed that this regulation is followed in order to avoid frequent shock holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many further research work was left to wait, for example on asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, and with which the slopes could be repaired easily and without the application of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14th suspicion.
Again, Valle del Cauca was empty when the crown was awarded to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner podium, showing a silver crown and the band she shows as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico took the crown and the ceder on its own, the department is already on 14 mistitel and Melina joins itself to the legion of women from the Valle del Cauca who had held the crown in their hands. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giral (2007), Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask themselves today is: What was missing?
For the result corresponds to the fall of a great favourite who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for free she was elected Queen of the Police and Major Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that were also received by the beauty kings Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is crucial for the jury’s decision to appoint her the First Miss is that she didn’t convince the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you most and why?” which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it’s a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I believe that the book that characterized the strongest for my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, a rather deep-going book.
It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that tells 'trusts'.
A response that hit little opposition, first because of the term ‘self civilization’ and second because she had not explained concrete how every book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what has to happen is happening.
And for all people: please read a little 'The Little Prince'.
Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogotá pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred, who had hosted all the insights and who had received all the awards in advance (Gastronomy Competition Oster, public vote on the best hand-covered costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous what the queen stressed, which therefore couldn't shine on the stage."
And this was noticed in her first performance in the bathing bag on the beach of the Hilton hotel and in her two lifts at the crown ceremony.
Though she was safe at both, she lacked the strength and vibration that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantis showed.
Ariel Osorio, the journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "says that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will eventually not become a queen."
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle couldn’t convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the meeting of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she has already worked on projects before participating in the competition,” she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the dery and fibrosis, which she was noticed in the stomach. But this is contradictory because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, acknowledges that Melina didn't have the best body, that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which, honestly, was hard to notice for me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from the magazine Cromos believes that the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The operations are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and here she had to pay.”
Because of this prize, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel forecast arose after the appearance in the bathing bag, which should be true in the night. It was confused that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort prize to not let her come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina starts her year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent at the nomination of the National Beauty Competition of Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will come into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had missed the crown.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali entered the story when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophoscopist of the Prosecutor's Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) appeared: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had preparation service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in criminal investigation proceedings.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he had to identify were.
In 2000, he settled in Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to irritations, i.e. the surface of the hand and foot.
In the week of the attack against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
On Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be that of the man who had led the world's oldest guerrilla. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger printing sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
But when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no shirt, was dressed like a farmer of the area, didn’t wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don’t lie.
Armed with a lupe, tint, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compares the fingerprints of the body with those on the printing sheet.
He had seen it right: It was Alfonso Cano.
Even that night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
on track search
For a Daktyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the honor given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Daktyloscopy is a precise science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and theft cases and confirm the identity of the people detained.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false documents or they have no.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the case of a theft he had to throw a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had set himself up with his hand right here when he pulled out a seafood full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints. but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several theft," he recalled.
With the help of the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be freed or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by butterflies.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and actually a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, he will be linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloscopist of the CTI explained that “the fingerprints with chemical or physical reactors would be taken from the object.”
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take.
After that, the copies are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personal office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without documents,” the CTI expert said.
He said not everything was the way it would be shown in the SCI TV series.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you catch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The “depressed” calls for the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A majority of them followed the removal order and changed their location to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement appealed to the New York authorities on Tuesday when they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square with a court order after they had been removed from the Square in the morning and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to enter with a judgment order that allowed the "emported" to regain the tent at this place. At the same time, another part of the movement stood on the order of expulsion and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine prisoners came.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the “Ocupy Wall Street” movement.
Bray concluded that the response of the “impurities” to the dismantling of their tent, which was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that banned the violent dismantling of the place and approved the tent to the protesters.
In addition, the "emports" occupied a new park located on the crossroads of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the site for at least an hour. But then the police met and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray could not give accurate numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with gloves among them.
The organization assures that there were hundreds of people who had entered this place, where a group of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a private property) remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing that is still scheduled for this Tuesday, which is intended to analyze the legitimacy of the climbing that took place in the morning.
Some of the demonstrants driven by the square carried photographs of this court order and distributed them. They even gave them to some police officers who watched the square, which resulted in "some small collisions", as Bray, who had shown that some police officers had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities to release members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "legislations that were adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the protesters from returning to the park with their tables and other things they had already used before."
Mayor Bloomberg clarifies to the press that due to this court order the re-opening of the place for public transport and the protesters has been cancelled.
The mayor personally defended the climbing of the Zuccotti Square, where 200 people were arrested, which was decided because the protesters "dive against the law."
Bloomberg said he had given the order to dismantle the place because it had "transformed into a place where people didn't come to demonstrate, but to violate the laws and in some cases to hurt others" because "some had received threats" and the inhabitants feared "for their quality of life".
“The cleansing in the morning was angry and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers,” the spokesman added, who accused the mayor of “not respecting the freedom of the press.”
The "Occupy Wall Street" officials said they are thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", the rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", the rabbits in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas show on Canadian TV.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the “crooner” (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1st in the TV program “It’s a Russell Peters Christmas” and bring a very special Virgin Mary to life.
CTV today spread images of the television show, in which Anderson - which also for the internet spread of a self-directed porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the shooter of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in the shoot, which is intended to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peter, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator at Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" show, appears as Jesus' child.
CTV’s Christmas program is based not only on Anderson and Peter, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is rebirth after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5 percent thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced in World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarterly falls, the GDP data from July to September ended this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 percent compared to the annual quota.
The value measured in the second quarter – in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 – also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the rebuilding of the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline by 0.9% for capital facilities recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstable rise.
Nevertheless, the actual shift in Japan’s economy is not based solely on Keynesian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awake thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1% due to the increasing expenditure for vehicles, travel and leisure jobs.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – becomes one of the “flight currencies” of investors who flee from the euro zone debt crisis and the foolish forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that loads like a grave on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony led their weak business outcomes from July to September to the notation of the yen.
While the markets continue to cover the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid re-evaluation of the yen,” said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really warm.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brake would be pulled with the greatest economic potential.
Because he dropped by four decades to the 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone is even below this average, which is at 100, after decreasing by eight percent to 99.13 points.
Athens regains doubts
Papadimos says the savings will be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and the widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to lose itself in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, said yesterday that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days he appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will support the new savings and will in no way withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday to the opening of a parliamentary debate that will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not expose doubts about his attitude: "We have committed to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organization that has to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with the Papandreu referendum, confirmed yesterday again that its demand is not to be rushed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties would not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika will "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knives have a long time.
Queen Sofia: “These are tools for progress and hope”
The Queen emphasized Spain's "prevailing" position regarding this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of small finance."
The Queen Sofia of Spain today reminded that in the last two decades Spain has become the world’s second donor for this fund for international cooperation. her “Being” insists that it is a “instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for the whole humanity based on trust in the people.”
She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to the Millennium goals set by the United Nations until 2015 and "especially the target of the number of people who have to live with income less than a dollar a day, i.e. below the "range of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," the Queen Sofia noted, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "create new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
“We’ve recorded many successes” and “we’re facing many challenges.”
The summit on small-purpose loans is not only a forum for discussions, but also a platform to promote “two basic goals”.
The Queen said it would be sought that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that 10 million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
The concept of small-sized loans goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the “way initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago” which Queen Sofia considers as a “act of justice and recognition”.
She described the father of this funding instrument as a “wonderful idealist who dedicated himself to the fight against poverty” and whose work she knew for 15 years when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the site.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Elf Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006.In all, “we have been able to observe a continuous development,” the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project gave her yesterday the assessment as “family head” in Valladolid and as “speaker of the poor.”
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by encouraging the present to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical Commandment”
Spain’s Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is “a ethical commandment” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she emphasized that it is a mistake to bind development aid at times of economic boom, since it is a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez believed that small-sized loans are “a harsh and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty,” and that the governments of the industrial states should now “more than ever” work according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, small-purpose loans are one of the “most important forms of development assistance.”
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised “the success”, “marginalized” people, “who always stands before closed doors” to give “hope” and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the presents in a city that “opened their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the EU due to general voting
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not planned in the program, but it was implemented in the autumn, in particular to provide enough to those activists who consider the government’s policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The presidential proposal of the European Commission was approved almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten voted against.
The several minutes-long Standing Ovation, which, due to their interventions, initially led to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Schäuble, did not open any doubts from the three European finance ministers.
The chancellor’s main idea, as well as the promise, has the following slogan: the response to the crisis is “not less, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time for a breakthrough in Europe has come.”
This could be expressed by an amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the budgetary policies of the Eurozone countries, which is stronger than the EU’s control, but it could also be necessary in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting “to give Europe a face”.
However, this is one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly opposed to Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: the Great Britain is opposing the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone is set.
In the same way, the delegates rejected, in a overwhelming majority, the proposal for a weighing of each country in the ECB’s board according to the weighing of the individual economies, which obviously brought a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor concerned with the calming of the climate within her party has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl; however, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in trouble that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European request dedicates a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in medical reports?
After the family aid, UMP and the government are now attacking the reports of illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to visit a family aid box and give a speech on the topic – which has been repeated since 2007 – of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the attempt to put the economy under a hard test, but on the other hand is not less a prejudice to an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers’ sick reports.
First with budgetary objectives: the government aims to introduce a fourth day before taking into account a disease reporting among workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the specific company’s permission, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A massacre, which, according to the daily newspaper Les Echos, threatens to rage anger, but would help to invest 280 million euros.
And that would come together with another adoption of a rather symbolic character: to give the state officials an unpaid carnage day in the case of illness (at the moment there is no carnage period for them, unlike the three carnage days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also re-defines the fraud topic, this time targeting the abuse associated with the absence of work.
“Controls will be significantly more important, and in addition, they are to be refunded if required,” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease reports seem somewhat disproportionate.
This is, in fact, the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offenses that have most fruited.
The French are not more frequently sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
First of all, let’s go to the national figures.
According to the National Health Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were paid per day in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, the daily inventions in 2008 accounted for 11.3 billion euros 5% of the health expenditure.
Under this amount fell 46% for maternity leave and work accidents and 54% for illness leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were given an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A average that hides certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers said they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study, this time recorded by the health insurance shows that 37% of diseases in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbors, the French workers do not tend more than elsewhere to unemployment.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global deficit rate (sickness or otherwise justified) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in diseases reports represents a disruptive proportion in terms of black labour.
With regard to fraud, only a weak scope is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 brings with it that there are systematic controls for reports of illness that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for Training and Continuing of Technicians and Engineers) under 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285,000 realized, short-term illness reports, namely in 37.050 cases, were "inappropriate or too long".
In the systematically controlled illness reports of more than 45 days of duration, under 1.2 million 11% of the cases were "inappropriate or unjustified", namely 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 cases of "unjust" on several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A figure that represents only a weak balance compared to those of black work, for example.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax gain per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily payments, and thus significantly more than the fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to shut down its economy.
This was announced on Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his government by the Union were not enough to fulfill this task.
“To continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” he said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament’s trust vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurogroup on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area is "on the game", he added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papademos planned to reduce the country’s state deficit “approximately 9%” of GDP from today to the end of the year, after that was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right flagship, had on Monday given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared for an additional savings.
“We will not vote in favour of new reforms,” he said at a parliamentary meeting of his party New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready with the provisions of reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would stop economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner with economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loans of more than 8 billion euros without the written guarantee of all parties on their support for the planned measures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure of abuse.
Euthanasia and accompanied freedom death must be legalized, according to an expert group
Canadians live in denial of death, as revealed by a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The body stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together on pain relieving treatment to provide the best pain relieving remedies, and this also beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked to each other in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, and in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts quote a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which had compared the mortality quality in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut down the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain remedies, the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
In Quebec, with 86% of hospitalized deaths, it is the highest.
In the weak question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are opposed to the federal government’s position, which has already exhausted no desire to make any amendments to the criminal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach to euthanasia and accompanied suicide has legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would involve MIVs in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of incompetent or unacceptable persons.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada where it is clearly illegal."
“The accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although here it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let’s imagine that according to an Angus-Reid survey in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already paid for euthanasia as they believe it allowed people at the end of their lifetime to relieve their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing the euthanasia does not result in communicating the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for those who have already committed a accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or suspension of the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the author of the report.
They also indicate in their recommendation list that the criminal law should indicate that the deposit of the funds for which a legitimate refusal has occurred should not be considered criminal.
The expert group also calls on health care professionals to be trained in respect of a rescue of funds at the end of their lives, and to be afraid of this without criminal prosecution.
The body stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together on pain relieving treatment to provide the best pain relieving remedies, and this also beyond the cases of cancer.
Lastly, with regard to the measures already widely used in the Canadian healthcare institutions for pain relief or lifelong measures, the Board calls for that measures to be taken into account at least because these measures served as little as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and refer to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of healthcare law have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, “extreme,” as this does not set any boundaries to the euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual’s own responsibility over all other values that are involved in the social action of society.
Now, he says, there would be “guidelines and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titled "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
In particular, Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts the reports concerning the non-preference of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls President Assad to resign
Damascus calls for a “complot”
Syria is more isolated
The partisan Baschar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the ministry’s authorities.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, who, however, faces it thanks to Russia’s support and shows itself a “complot” against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion of Syria, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's withdrawal.
King Abdullah II from Jordan was yesterday the official Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "install his authority in Syria" in which about 40 civilians and members of the government were killed.
"Let Bashar focus on the interests of his country, he would withdraw, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu has complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned by success.
“Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go,” he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a constantly harsh attitude.
The United States, on its part, welcomed the “fortified consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” as a result of the Arab League and the European Union’s decisions.
“International community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, and countries like Turkey have hit an increasingly sharp sound in the face of the repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government were killed in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH said.
Two more civilians were killed, according to the NGO, in "shoot exchanges and heavy bomb attacks around Jobar" in the occupied city of Homs.
At the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian foreign trade minister Walid al-Muallim, however, believed that the country will “release the end of the crisis.”
By the way, he reacted with insistence on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he estimated was a "dangerous step".
“Syria will not give up,” he added, adding, “the controversial complots against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French foreign trade minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his favour to send UN observers to defend civilians from the repressions of the regime, that he is after capturing himself into his "paranoia" and standing on his side.
A planned new assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis plan agreed on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, predictable withdrawal of the military troops from the occupied cities and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Secretary of State Sergey Lawrow has classified the decision of the Arab League as "inappropriate" yesterday to warn himself of defending possible sanctions against Damascus, although China has already warned Syria to implement the crisis emergency plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice preparation
Mario Monti, the future Italian prime minister, has demanded the markets a little more time to form his staff and implement a program that "offers" call to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today’s meeting of trade unions and workers.
It was his task to call a cabinet to the parliament, which is relatively rigorously composed of external technocrates.
"Monti talked about an important program with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups that took part in the talks after he met with the current President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of the House of Representatives, had forgotten to wait for Mario Monti to make a vote of confidence to Parliament until Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be covered by a draft list presented by Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock markets and bonds demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he emphasized, noting that it is "certain that the markets will be patient and conscious."
The president’s order was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was increasing again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The prime minister in office should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrates, although he had emphasized, he would like to engage “politics” as well.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of the House of Representatives, the new government should receive the Parliament's confidence proof by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself to work urgently in the sense of the goal of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had emphasized that "this does not change our diagnosis with regard to the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not its budget balance in 2013, despite the savings plans made in these last months, has in particular requested new harsh measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "the head of the chiefs of Italy, which will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also stands on the need for economic recurrence,"as a country that has no growth to show, cannot respect the deficit figures."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004) represents an "Epoch Change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "Challenge of Trust" as well as a "Other Italy", the lead authors say.
The grave unknown here is the longevity of his stable.
President Napolitano would like to prevent anticipated elections, as Italy has to raise state bonds for 200 billion euros from now on to April 2012.
Russian scientists support Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Wjatshev Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-purpose oil, a U.S. NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report published by the International Agency for Nuclear Security AIEA and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The IAEA last week its "serious concerns" on the occasion of an "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to a thorough study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, the 1934-born Danilenko has apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for more than three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and has been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he said he left the center to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-Diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" was supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only highly trained in this technology, but also, as a member of the agency, his entire professional career has worked on this technology essentially directly in the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religious-motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published Monday, have either slightly declined or slightly increased during the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49 per cent, while the number of violent crimes committed against Catholics has increased by 13 per cent, the number of crimes committed against Jews has decreased by 4 per cent, and the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes has increased by 14 per cent globally.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has increased to 6,628 cases, including 47,3% of racial differences and 20% of religious differences-motivated crimes, the FBI said.
“After a decline in 2009, it’s annoying to see these crimes and crimes grow again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First said.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered to be a serious violation of the law against human rights,” said Paul Legendre, an official of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is represented in federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violent acts against race, skin color, religion or descendence and now also involve crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and increasingly resembles Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced amendments in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once more similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" enable better readable live view of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users, whose messages ("Tweets") you track and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to track your messages, whether you subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general internet spread on Monday "at a low percentage of users in August", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre user) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" on the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
“The “activity” feature will help me better track certain elements of my flow Twitter,” said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Enrollment of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The Austrian government of the brutal Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition on Tuesday decided to incorporate a “Golden Budget Rule” into the constitution to reduce public deficits and also avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the top-bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann very personally who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian debt is at 74.6%, thus far above the criterion established by the Maastrichter Treaty of 60%, but significantly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s payability didn’t fall to a hit from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian-democratic minister.
Austria also calls on a call at the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the heads of states and governments had then demanded the introduction of the reduction of public deficit by the end of 2012 and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The adoption by the Austrian government in this regard is similar to the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a “rule” into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of GDP each year, from 2017 the structural budget deficit should not exceed the limit of 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens new intervention on currency markets
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would re-interfere in the currency markets if the yen should continue to rise.
"If we have to show an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we have done the last time," Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again accelerated close to the historic levels that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar in order to lower the Japanese currency value, which is on a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly risen above, drowned by the purchases of investors who see the yen as a “flight value” in these uncertain times of global economic recession and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar dropped below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro dropped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had dropped the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it destroys the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value brought by Japanese companies from abroad, as these exchange them into national currency.
“Japan is struggling after the earthquake and the tsunami of 11 March that destroyed the region of Tohoku (North-East) for its reconstruction,” Noda, who fears that this price of the yen could kill the weak rise already in the Keime.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the explosive export revenues and consumption of the "plombed" households, regained power.
The prime minister, however, estimates that the price of the yen does not reflect the "economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, on his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to dissolve the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, informed that the BoJ has already launched "suitable measures", making it possible that no additional currency settlement is expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting in late October, the Notenbank had raised its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) coverage funds it had spent on various purchases of financial titles to float the liquidity market.
The Eurozone:
Interest rates rise rapidly, stock exchanges go back
The risk of infection of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European figures.
Despite the appointment of the new leaders in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone, are running a little more in negative currents on Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 p.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt dropped by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
“Given the new tensions with regard to the returns of state bonds in the eurozone in trouble, the global stock markets continue to export part of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and are too well aware of the risk of infection,” says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, citing the news agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on the other hand, is again concerned by the market participants about the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a drop of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned his eyes to Europe, and the trade is moving on a limited variation corridory as long as investors don't have any evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resuscitation of concerns about the future of the Eurozone damages the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 p.m. the European currency was worth $1,3570, so it left by 0.4%.
The stock exchange brokers say it has gone back after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, had presented a petition, in particular the possibility for the countries in trouble to leave the euro zone without at the same time leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 10 years 6.85%, which of the Spanish securities mature to 6.2%.
These tensions in the interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the worries of investors.
The future Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt burden.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October is "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate (spread) between the German and Spanish 10-year obligations has again reached a new, historic height.
In anticipation of Eurozone growth
Statistically, France recorded a economic growth driven by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, performing a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the drop in the figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the GDP (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economists most.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The Eurozone is expected to have a first high account at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission of the risk of a re-recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, then this is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting to think about this topic as well as the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so a huge portion of the world’s population will not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, we need to mitigate the confusion of fossil resources in order to continue to produce continuously electricity, without forgetting the compulsory need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic lost from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which puts its decision under the need to find a substituting substituting source, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to mention only a few states, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, has decided to move to Fukushima to join another unit in its park by re-operating the Three Mile Island plant, which was stopped after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model focused on renewable energy sources is occasionally presented as a model, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The elections in Berlin will be reduced in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence increased by the increased use of imported gas in particular by Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European leader in wind energy, from which it accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest consumers of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; due to this, its CO2 output as well as its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalized economy plays a key role in competitiveness and a stability position for the industry on the national ground, the French companies have a advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong rise in the energy price, which will bring to illusion the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A survey found that this is a price that the vast majority of the French are not willing to pay as they show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We anticipate that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry sector with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a lot of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be the victim, and the annual investment goods and nuclear energy exports of EUR 6 billion would be more and more reduced.
Which electricist would hire an EPR designed to operate for 60 years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no miracle means of producing electricity like a devil work.
The low-CO2 solutions developed by the company Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy prove the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible safety level is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromised and transparent controls in already existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Those working teams that have made themselves a name due to their professionalism are just obsessed by the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disasters.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it passed without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn up by reactor construction as well as endless, human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and builders of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is desirable among the electrotechnicians to build a nuclear power plant, a stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by letting them free to travel the lead position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bucket for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogms and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many corners - overload by police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France itself had called.
Recently, the disturbance directed against foreign students from the government side had marked the weekly sights, the Minister of the Interior had randomly announced (see Libération of May 23), that France "no need any talents, maurers or servants from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a comprehensive consensus between the right and the left.
On the right side, the sound was hit by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country," on the left by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 stated that France "can't absorb the whole poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of gravity.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish clempers was divided in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of gravity that one is willing to accept toward immigrants.
Francois Hollande limits himself in his program to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our “migration problems”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present in a recent work that covers the latest findings about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration flow on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigrant countries.
Restricting immigration would disrupt growth and harm the situation on the labour market.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local wage workers, as they do heavy-pointed professions in sectors that are technically unemployed.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers are less tired, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not affordable to the job offer.
Positive Salary Effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect between local and immigrant migration on wages and domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that an 1% increase in immigrant flow would result in an interrelated, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity introduced by the immigrants is beneficial to the creation of ideas as well as economic growth (high percentage of immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to social systems, in the European countries at an average of approximately 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 contributes an average net income (income minus spending) of around €150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing cutting points "with the teeth" at his appointment.
However, these said teeth, which should scare immigrants, obtained the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some probably believed it was enough to exercise the right of vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy obsess over its enemies once and for all.
It is known since Napoleon "the little" that it was a characteristic of the spirit.
The general right of election, which is the necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can even well become a “instrument of expression” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are, is an economic crisis, but it is as much and first of all a political and democratic crisis.
The transformation of the Greek truth-fake reference would have had twice unclear character in this regard: one of the need for a powerful return to politics, and the other of the worrying feeling of its impossibility, its immeasurability.
This ambivalence should be considered exaggerated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer targeting in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A freedom for the European solitary ruler, or a jump with united eyes into the emptiness of nationalist withdrawal: a brutal choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from full right, clearly and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal – we don’t know where to end the list – since there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It’s the whole Europe that has the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies that suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is demolished at the international level.
One is worried about the transfer of sovereignty toward Europe—this is the whole Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each of its affiliated nations.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty the leadership of the European project back to the hand.
For it is in general whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, get free from the markets, and create a future through investments.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without ensuring that we are destroyed.
After this proposal has been struggled for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is pushing the European economic leadership to do so.
I agree.
But imagining this without political integration and a stronger democracy – as it predicts to the citizens – would be a new foolishness and another shake.
We must take a new stage of European development on us.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone couldn’t do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general entrance
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards-telephones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most wearable segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transportation or equalization of purchases by simply holding the card on a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of contactless payments on the ground after it has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the starts are rather modest: Only 400,000 contactless visa cards were spread.
However, consumer markets make damp.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher rate, it is now necessary that the banks expose their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically sending their customers bank cards that are packed with contactless chips in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A relatively small percentage of devices is currently equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
“They are in delay.”
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” says Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking initiative.
Crédit Agricole has announced the start of a test race in Caen, which will take place from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had said yesterday to prepare for the market introduction of an offer that allows its customers contactless payment by mobile.
The terrorist front goes from Sahara to Nigeria.
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) terrorist group al-Qaida and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria has now “acquired certainty” about it.
“The way the two organizations act and the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation,” he said without going further into the details.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
Investigations on the kidnapping of two French citizens in Niger last January have promoted interfaces to days.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, were alleged to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian detectives have found a number of telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
The terrorist attack
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who has been staying for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, who has been the wing of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
“It is possible.”
“It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from Auven and that it is increasingly active,” says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these “support services” have become increasingly visible in their course, as well as Boko Harem’s calls and operation methods, which now indicate the picking up of suicide attacks and the use of increasingly complex explosives, carrying the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since exercised pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed seen the grouping for a long time as a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
faster success
The Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist believer Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means so much as "Western education is a shame" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this uninterrupted region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
She politizes herself and demands strict compliance with the sharia, while the activists associated with her engage in the struggle against the divine central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the vision.
In 2009, the Boko Haram activists showed themselves especially active with their intensified attacks on the Commissariat.
However, Abuja’s response is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its high mountains in the north.
Last Christmas she learned about an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is accused of a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist attack in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has been concerned by all security experts since then.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalians operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had been warned of Boko Harem during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was prepared to "communicate all the evidence."
The Republican presidential candidates
Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and helping Israel.
Can a crisis-depleted America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates this way, the voters could get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their counterparts have repeatedly made their donating statements and their statements about the offshore policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Through China, Iran and the aid of Israel falls - often understood in no way - slogans.
Meanwhile, the highest in turn in terms of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and point them to the "currency manipulation" - the leading topic in a America that is driven by the migration of all industries to Asia to the top.
It was stupid if this would imply the beginning of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have an exhausted vision of offshore policy, has almost shut down the air of his emotion-smalling gift.
He had called for a handy but constructive conversation with Beijing (also the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion surveys.
Reagan's image
Romney had also promised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program would fail.
“If I’m elected, I’ll take on Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb.”
In addition, he has promised increased military assistance to Israel and accused Obama of being guilty of commitments to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest candidate, has a shameful document ignorance to show.
Recently, he appealed to counter the Chinese military threat as Beijing "proves to develop a nuclear weapon" - and appeared to keep in mind the fact that China has already possessed military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military attacks against Iran, on his side hurts to be prepared to take the U.S. military service in Mexico against drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama’s ban on torture against alleged terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an out-of-political weight.
Contrary to current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine as regards the topic of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive negotiations with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his “children” from Iraq, his uncertainty in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enemy is not so unnecessary.
The people are more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security among Obama, which Bin Laden has shut down.
Since Iraq, it has protected itself from military interventions that lead to eradication.
And Obama surprises more reasonably by argumenting that America needs to be economically restored to raise its leadership to a new life.
North Stream, New Gate to Russian Gas in Europe
The Nord Stream, which runs on the Baltic Sea ground and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been launched.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas company Gazprom wanted to do this event with glory and glory.
More than 500 charged guests, including four state and government leaders, have been on the Baltic Sea coast on Tuesday, under orchestral call and at the fine-chmeckerbuffet, accompanied by the introduction of the new gasway Nord Stream, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically joined the control of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe annually through a first pipeline of 1.224 km long, which connects the region of St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line is already placed on the path itself.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous building is a victory.
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream Pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any routes through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on land routes.
This is why these two countries lose a little of their power: it will now become more difficult for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not shaken to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater supply security by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of a breakdown of European energy, as the project has hit a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has achieved its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy western countries with strong gas consumption and their gas profits are tending.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically,” François Fillon confirmed in the introduction of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the heavy gas contracts are also important on the political and economic side.
All this explains the widespread smile of the many represented Gazprom managers in Lubmin regarding the gas governance.
The construction of this remote gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete molding, which is intended to protect it from ships.
It rests on the sea floor, at approximately 200 m depth.
During their construction, the mining fields dated World War II had to be removed.
“About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed with caution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for North Stream.
Furthermore, increased measures were taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal serpent, heavily as 242 Eiffel storms, which over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in front of the coast of Sweden, but the project managers took away from it, as the Swedish were little pressured to see a Russian state company staying on a permanent way at the height of their coasts.
“In the event of an accident, we will close the gas interruption in less than a minute,” Jens Müller said.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus disappears into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers as just unlikely, as the swing nights were estimated at a consistency of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas remote pipeline is guaranteed both by a underwater robot that is controlled for external observation purposes by a seafood, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas remote pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, miβt a meter diameter, is entered into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device at its arrival provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal.
The gas remote pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without having to be undergoing even the least repair.
Gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the arrival, 100 bar at the output point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the leadership remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of its shares.
Furthermore, there are the German companies E. ON and BASF affiliated (per 15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French company group GDF Suez (per 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the remote gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is affordable.
The company has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transportation, on an extended twenty-year contract.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how gross the real transportation amount is out,” Jens Müller said.
The funding of the gas remote pipeline construction was secured by 30% of the shareholders and by 70% by bank loans.
The total work costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are hard to take their expenditure back, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas remote line takes place on a sandy coastal streak near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas output bridge.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before it is transferred to the German gas distances.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal is supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flower of adventure, when candlestick with the writing added hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular band, its rubber band, the egg-colored sides, as old over time.
The Moleskine Notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to launch a distinctive design notebook at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then professional consultant of the company, is commissioned with the introduction of the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which calls a wooden wolk, which is used for payments, for example, of polster banks.
This type of notebook was highly demanded among writers and travellers.
“Moleskine has resuscitated an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years, when only 3,000 notes were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a fantasy picture of the buyers, as the notebook enthusiasms both business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which in its beginnings had 12 employees, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notes in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers, and understands how to maintain its identity.
“We are followed by the spirit of time and its new need for writing, which exists despite the e-mails’ upwardness,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character trail is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (circuit) " in which architects and artists exhibited their own notesbooks.
In August, the company also brought a band with leopard patterns to the market on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine took advantage of its success and this cultural spirit and knew how to diversify its products: pockets, timetables, fillers, computer hills... The brand features the entire range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus introduced a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the 15th Week of Work for Disabled Persons.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled persons is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
to disgrace?
“No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which organizes the “Work Week for Disabled.”
“The progress achieved within 15 years is considerable.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but twice as high.”
“Though there is no destruction, there is still a lot to do.”
However, it must be said that many obstacles continue to exist for disabled workers before they get a job.
More frequently it happens to the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a graduate degree and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in disabled people compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to regain and that make it the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much about the brakes.
The uninterpreted remains, the mental behaviors, which, though certain, but slowly evolve.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité that the managers surveyed had “a poor level of knowledge about disabled persons” that “is overrepresented” from “persons in wheelchair, mental or intellectual minorities.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a wide way ahead to the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of 1987.
These latter figures from 2008 indicate a quota of 2.6%.
“We are now at about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization that is commissioned to make contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: The number of "paying fees" operations has decreased, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, has created a strong pressure on the companies,” said Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also brings real awareness, especially in the large corporate groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the facilities employ between 20 and 49 employees with disabilities, companies with 100 to 199 employees, while 82%.
Hazard: “What a Luck”
Already before they showed their faces on the Blue Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not healed their pleasure that the friendship game brought them.
It would be too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to close peace.
Five months after the temperamentful gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had nothing but praise for his person.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian.”
“I want to look forward,” the born Liller assures from his side.
As for the contrast between his performance in the club and national self"It's a unit that justifies everything."
“I’m in Lille all the year, which is not the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, accompanied on Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "blind".
However, without neglecting the note of the "satisfaction".
The French national team he has been shooting since he was seven years old, and he led his winning field trains between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported,” he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the “unitary” character of this meeting.
“Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there.”
“We just passed the way.”
“To be able to play against them means great luck!”
Leekens, on the other hand, allowed him to call "highness" with goodness.
“The pride, a galamatch.”
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his character as" neighbors" - that France"has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done great work,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician looks very well to share the aircraft with the blue (the French national self) ... and it is to Brazil in 2014.
“We, the little Belgians, are coming out very hard,” he emphasized.
“We’re planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." the game against France included.
Portugal is very confident.
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is very optimistic about the match against Bosnia on Tuesday (22.00 p.m.) in Lisbon.
In the match, the two teams missed the fact.
“At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is not the least raise of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national self, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, it actually means 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve a opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the match (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the curves have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the match over more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the matter up to the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
“This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we have not achieved an outward gate.”
At home, however, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of a audience that should be equally hot to the game, even if the match wasly announced as "very short," the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We are expecting a very short match, but we are completely convinced that we can win the top hand," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We still have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 European Championship,” according to Carlos Queiroz.
The dissolution on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach a goal and win.
A disagreement can already be enough for the Bosnians who also need a gate.
“This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outward tower,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have planned to exercise the maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the very beginning, to “do not give them time to think.”
This is a good idea, provided that this time it will be implemented.
