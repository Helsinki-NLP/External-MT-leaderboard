Martelly led the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in the vote yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the parliamentary commission spoke before the CEP president resigned, as part of a plan to push the country to a new election.
Martelly's reply was that the Commissioner had been responsible for the political uprising that had been taking place since October.
The sometimes violent protests have been accompanied by a series of elections, some of which are scheduled to take place in 2011.

This is called the pH of the oil.
the color of angina salt changes with its acidity or alkalinity
The pH values are indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).

The secret to their success is to choose one occupation, a unique one that makes one cat stand out from the rest.
The lion is a very social animal, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is made up of one or three male lions in pairs, and up to 30 female lions and their cubs.
Female lions usually live in close proximity to each other, forming a large family of sisters and cubs.
The tiger-like group acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, is a lion-like creature (not a big cat) in the pack, and can kill its prey.
A skilled tiger can climb trees (not very skillfully), leap, and fly, and pull with the same strength as a powerful human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the tiger, and the jaguar - only four species that are capable of prey.
The tiger's roar is similar to that of a lion's roar, but it is like the sound of a loud, uncertain voice.
The wolf preys on small animals, such as bees, snakes, lizards, and birds, and almost all the animals it feeds on are smaller than it is.

When a small group of reptiles (count the number of reptiles) is found separated from their normal population, the new ones (such as crossing a mountain or a river, or moving to another island so that they can no longer easily return to their original habitat) will be found in a different environment.
The new territory will have different resources, different players; the new nation will need different things to be stronger than before.
Instead of changing the number of primates, they continue to evolve.
Gradually, as the population becomes more and more accustomed to their new surroundings, they become less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, thousands, even billions, of years later, the two races will be so different that they will be impossible to identify with.
Species are the natural and inevitable process of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide (CO2).
Plants produce food from the sun through photosynthesis and provide shade.
We build our homes and make our clothes out of wood, and we eat most of our food from wood.
The Mosasaurus was a predator, no longer afraid of anything but its fellow mosasaurs.
Its long, spiky teeth and 70 sharp, whip-like teeth, as well as several in its upper jaw, suggest that nothing can escape its grasp.
We do not know, but it may have had a raguar-like appearance, and it ate sea turtles, large fish, and other crustaceans, and it may have eaten its own worm.
It also attacked anything that could enter the water; even the giant dinosaur T. rex was not immune to it.
Although we may be familiar with most of their dishes, the Romans also had some delicious dishes, including wild boar, turkey, pork, and the common cowpea.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food on chairs, the rich preferred a roasted chicken where they could eat alone.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the food that was introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no onions, coconuts, raw onions, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans would ever taste the flesh of a goose.
The Babylonians built a huge temple for all their gods, which they considered to be the city of the gods.
The water could be used for sacrifices to the gods, and the priests could try to dispel the curse by making idols and amulets.
Each temple had a courtyard and a courtyard wall, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
At times, the temple was enclosed by a pyramidal wall, or ziggurat.
The center of the wall was a unique temple to a pagan god.

If you have seen the movie National Treasures, you may recall the map of the treasures on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true, for even if something is written on the back of the piece, it is not a map to a treasure.
The text of the Declaration of Independence, including the words  First Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. The text is plain-looking, the paper facing down.
Although the author is unknown, it is known that in the early days of his life, the text on a large epic (about 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was hidden for safekeeping.
Now, it seems, the words were put into a kind of rhyme.
The D-day invasion and the ensuing war resulted in the liberation of northern France, but not southern France.

On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks the American and Free French forces had conquered southern France and were now on their way to Germany.
Progress is a quality and a practice, involving a large group of congregation servants and a harmonious, collective spirit.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, which in turn describes a society as a whole.

The most trivial traits and customs disappear without leaving a trace in the story and fail to be translated into art.
During the Revolutionary Wars, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole organ - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had no central government or legislature, it relied on the executive branch, which had no legislative authority.
Nor did he have the authority to regulate the tax laws of the nations.
The articles required a unanimous vote from all the smaller states before they could be ratified, and the smaller states ignored the central government and even their own representatives were allowed to vote in the courts.
The Italian national soccer team is second only to Germany in the world ranking, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Since Japan is composed of many islands, Japan and its geography are called archipelago.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when traveling Ulaya sailors wrote the island's name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a colony in Taiwan from north to west, marking the beginning of a revolution in the production of high-quality grain and the recruitment of Chinese women laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing (1644-1912) troops captured the fortress of Taiwan and the northern gate, declaring Taiwan a Qing territory in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is home to three major structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Cemeteries.
Many of the buildings will be restored and tourists will be able to see what they looked like.
By 1976, 30 floors of the old Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used photographic lens in the world was 35 mm, the width of the lens used when the analogue era was ending.
It is still being produced, but more importantly, the aspect ratio and the quality of the images have been copied in the latest digital cameras.
The 35mm is actually about 36mm wide and 24mm long.
The ratio of the width to the length of such a figure (divided by 12 to obtain a simple linear ratio) is now said to be 3:2.
Many forms of the text (such as the APS major scale, for example) are equal to, or close to, this.
The law of thirds is a simple way to reconcile the differences in a picture.
He gives you the best point of the word faith, the central point, which divides the image into two threads, from top to bottom, and from the sides.
In the early history of Europe, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was subjected to a series of scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united Europe despite differences in language, culture, and religion.
His power was felt by all, from the king to the common man.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's collections exist for that purpose.
The supremacy of the church had existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and the increasing power and money had led many to question the validity of the doctrine.
When the day dawned, Britain's navy was ready to defend Germany.
The strategy worked, cutting off vital military and civilian aid, even though the ban did not comply with its international standards and was widely accepted for the past two centuries.
The British had placed submarine mines under the sea to prevent ships from passing through, making even civilian ships vulnerable.
With few men to avoid the threat, the German army hoped for a similar response to their naval battleships.
In the 1920's, the spirit of the world and of nationalism was one of peace and abandonment.
After witnessing the horrors of the first world war, nations have sought to prevent a renewed war
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a leave of absence from the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four volumes of his autobiography, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique system of dating; each Chinese dynasty or dynasty was a distinct dynasty.
The dynasties also had periods of unrest that divided the provinces, most notably the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, a fierce battle was fought between the fearful claimants to the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of Chinese dying in a struggle for the most prestigious seats in the palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of metrication, the shift from dictatorship to totalitarianism, the spirit of nationalism, and the belief that the earth belongs to all, not to one.
Also, after the Revolution, the workplace was opened to all men and the jobs were given to those who were competent and knowledgeable.
This was also applied to the ranks of the army, since the military was not divided into divisions but was given according to rank.
The French Revolution also silenced many other persecuted workers who joined the revolutionary movement.
Muhammad was deeply interested in discovering the mysteries of life. He visited a cave also known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) where he meditated.
The same remains, which are also centuries old, provide a unique picture of Muhammad's faith.
Some of the caves are isolated and isolated from the earth, just on the top of a hill north of Mecca.
True, it is difficult to find a cave, even if you know it exists, but if you do, you will find it a safe haven.
The sky was bright and the mountains dazzling, and the world was a tiny bit of a mirage.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the most famous of all the ruins still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramids built to honor the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to many pyramids (the largest being the great pyramid), hundreds of small tombs, hundreds of temples, and a huge Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, tombs, and shrines were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The upper arrow is a V-shaped symbol and the lower arrow is a box with no bottom.
The upper part indicates that you should start with the bow's tip, and the lower part indicates that you should start with the bow's bow (the point where your hand holds the bow) when you shoot it.
The upward swing of the violin's bow always produces a soft sound, while the downward swing produces a strong, high-pitched sound.
Feel free to write down the notes, but remember that the notes and the purpose of the song should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the feared King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the queen's sister, Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from the Palace of Versailles with the ladies of the royal court.
As they boarded the train, they returned to Paris, terrified by the shouting and screaming of the crowd, who offered refuge to the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages.
One of the mobs even shook the head of the royal guard at Versailles before the Queen, who was in a state of shock.
My brothers who served in the American occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. government to pay for the massive and lucrative business he had done on behalf of the Philippine government through the bankrupt Wall Street treasury.
Indeed, the long-term profits from the exploitation of the Filipino people could have been a major economic asset for the American colonial empire.
To learn about the Templars, you must understand the reason for the fragmentation.
The period of time during which these events occurred is called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300)
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages, which began in the late Middle Ages, and ended in the 1500s.
Technology-driven decision-making is a broad spectrum of ethical considerations, from the impulse of technology or technological progress to the unique notion that human destiny is determined by the prevailing ideas based on scientific principles and technological advances.
Most of the interpretations of technology-based decision-making have two main assumptions: that the development of technology itself is driven by ethical or political factors, and that technology also has a "transformation" in the society that uses it since its birth, rather than the social conditions of those societies.
For example, one might argue that the improvement in road design is due to faster cars.
However, good roads in rural areas are still not economically viable for the few who have cars, and new roads are being built to lower the cost of owning a car.
The crowded traffic also increases the number of road accidents, leading to new forms of human-centered health care.
The romantic movement was characterized by a series of moral and ethical choices, some of which were copied by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, the photographers disciplined the people, and over time, rules and values based on them developed, which, as they became more harmonious and socially acceptable, were better than the forced rules.
While Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of medieval European fashion.
Its use as a place of recreation began probably in 400 C.E. and continued until perhaps 1100 C.E.
The trade was reduced during the 12th century by the fact that the Conquerors brought back gifts such as silk and other jewellery that were more valuable than those found in the Byzantine markets.
It was around this time that the name Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was popular between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries
At first, the emblems were influenced by Byzantine traditions from the East.
However, with the slow progress of communication, the Eastern type of iron could still be produced in 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Eastern Europe began to develop its own style of clothing, and one of the most important developments of the time was the introduction of the pocket-sized garment.
A subsistence farm is a farm where the sole purpose of producing enough food to feed a farmer and his family is to maintain the farm.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, time-consuming method of growing crops by over-harvesting and replanting or by using similar simple methods to increase yields.
In ancient times, many farmers cultivated for their own food, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Small groups of personalities and practices bring together like-minded individuals who feel isolated from the routine of society and allow them to develop their values and personalities.
Differences in personality and culture can be seen, as can differences in age, ethnicity, class, social status, and occupation.
The factors that contribute to subclasses of culture are language, fashion, religion, politics, nature, culture, or a mixture of many other factors.
Members of a minority group usually identify themselves as members of a distinct and distinct culture, which includes a social structure, customs, and traditions.
One popular way to show the value of communication is to use the few negative experiences of children who, through abuse, hardship, or abuse, were not exposed to adults when they grew up.
Some children are abused by their parents (usually by their own parents); sometimes they are abandoned because their parents oppose them because of their disability.
Your teenage children may have been abused or have experienced terrible things before they were abandoned or lost.
Some say that he was raised in a stable with animals; others say that he lived alone in the forest.
When raised in a nonhuman animal, a wildling cub displays (in a visible way) all the traits that may be present in the animal that is caring for it, such as fear or isolation.
While study by inquiry should make study easier and more enjoyable, the use of aids is far superior.
The toolkit is not a learning tool but is primarily a tool for those who are learning new skills, such as using a new computer or starting new construction projects.
The clockwork may be invisible, the teacher may be, but the microsoft office clock is also.
The Help Boxes are embedded in computer programs and designed to ask questions, warn, and explain how to do something that would otherwise be too difficult for students to do themselves.
children are given a place of refuge from other threats, such as neglect, abuse, or exploitation
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that provides adequate protection, shelter, and education, but only in such an environment.
We know that the Foster Care System is a safe and secure place for such children.
shelters for the homeless need to be clean, secure, and well-educated
Child care facilities should provide all other services that the child cannot access.
The Internet is a network of social networks and networks of individuals.
The variety of the world has led to a wide variety of forms, uses, and perceptions.
For example, "learning" and "social networking" are thought to be key factors in the social use of the Internet (Jacob et al., 1995).
"Self-determination" and "progressive" have been promoted as a form of entertainment, and were discussed by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their study of social media behaviour.
The use of video has led to some important improvements in the processing of body patterns, facial features, and features in very short girls.
In particular, a person can be told to lie by changing his or her behavior.
Oliver Sacks, in his pamphlet The President's Speech, noted how the brain's damaged ability to judge the integrity of a person's conscience is a hindrance to hearing speech.
He suggested that the same ability to change human behavior could be applied to animals, such as domestic dogs.
Studies in the 20th century suggest that there are two types of reproduction; the hidden and the visible.
Mutation creates new variations, causing selection to remove the original variation.
Division and organization of the organisms cause the evolution of the species back and forth between two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for the giant squid and the human-like chimpanzee to satisfy their need for amino acids from the diet of leaves alone.
Moreover, failure to do so results in serious problems: stunted growth, starvation, and unnecessary death.
The most readily available food from plants may be the proteins found in the leaves and seeds of the plant, but these are difficult to digest in large animals like us unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal products (egg, egg, and egg yolk) are not only more digestible but also have a high protein content containing all the essential amino acids.
In all other respects, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein shortages in ways similar to those of chimpanzees living in the savanna today.
Sleep deprivation is like waking up at a certain time and then falling asleep for a few hours (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a low-pitched clock to wake you up, not to wake you up.
If you find yourself changing the clock while you sleep, you may have to put it on the other side of the room, and you have to get up and go out of the window to look at it.
Other biorhythmic choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up and walk.
The degree of inner peace is related to the degree of physical and spiritual stress.
The more you are tired, the more you are able to relax, to believe in yourself, to be able to feel your own energy.
One of the things that can hinder us from reaching that goal is our own anxiety and negative thinking.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhism, but it is supplemented by the principles of mahayana and the philosophy of Indian yoga.
In its teachings, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple - it is based on Kundalini Yoga, socialism, and love for all creation.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the power of consciousness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, recitation, and visualization.
By witnessing the meditation of various gods, the energy forms are purified, awakened from the dead by the pure consciousness of knowledge.
Germany was an international enemy during World War II, with the USSR and the United States almost forming a coalition.
With the war drawing to a close, former friends became enemies, and bitter strife broke out.
The war was to last 40 years and be fought in reality, with the armies of the Allies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish army had dispersed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize according to the Roman army's line.
But that plan was thwarted that night when 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded Belarus and Ukraine and rebuilt the walls of Eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Shipping is more convenient than transporting cargo and passengers across the sea.
The navy's role is to provide land and sea transportation, and in that capacity, the navy is able to destroy enemy ships and vessels.
One notable example of this was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was trying to help Britain by transporting goods across the Atlantic.
On the other hand, the German navy, using U-boats in particular, tried to stop the passage.
If the Allies had failed, Britain, which was predominantly white, would have been overrun by Germany.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them for their milk, milkweed, meat, and fur.
The young goats were raised in a barn and left to roam the wilderness, where they were hunted by predators, like the world-famous shepherd, a method still used today
Railway tracks for horse-drawn wagons were built in England in the early 16th century.
Even wagonways with parallel wooden planks allowed the horses to run faster and faster on the highways than on the closed roads of the day
The chariot was made of iron, but he soon realized that the chariot could be made of more than just iron.
This became common, but the metal was now causing severe damage to wooden wheels.
Finally, wooden legs were replaced by iron legs. In 1767, the first railway trains were introduced.
The earliest known form of walking was the upright gait, which evolved in the first two billion years of the human race, when Homo erectus (Homo erectus) evolved.
Their successors, the Australopithecus, did not walk with their heads upright like statues.
The two-legged footwork is found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs in the early prehistoric period, about seven million years ago.
We may become friends with our fear, join organizations that promote fear, and become militants to reduce future threats to a certain degree.
But if we do not want to find temporary relief, we need to identify the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is a matter of common knowledge that human progress in science and technology has not only increased the world's problems, but also the human population's overpopulation and its increasingly violent behavior.
After being signed into law by the Senate on July 4, the handwritten copies signed by Senate President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were sent in small quantities to John Dunlap's printing works.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first reading of the document was given in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8, with John Nixon in attendance.
It was sent to George Washington on July 6, who set it to be read in the New York City Army on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides Papyri are the only known copies of the document that have survived to this day.
Today, many paleontologists believe that only one dinosaur survived and is still alive.

In today's advanced transportation system, there is a growing interconnectedness and mutual support between transportation systems and private vehicles.
Scientists now know that the greenhouse effect has removed one of the most important aspects of human civilization over the past two billion years.
Everyone joins the community and makes travel arrangements. Almost everyone complains about the transport arrangements.
In developed lands, such complaints about the state of the water or the flooding of the lands are rare.
Why do transportation systems have such conflicts, why do they fail every day, or why do transportation engineers have such a great deal of success, or why is something more important happening?
Traffic monitoring is the study of the behavior of drivers and vehicles as they pass between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, the speed of a car in a road is difficult to calculate because it is impossible to determine the speed of every driver.
Fortunately, the driver is in a precise and orderly way; now, the speed of the cars on the road is well-ordered and you can tell by a few simple calculations.
To determine the accuracy of the traffic, a relationship is established between three basic features (1) the approach, (2) the position of the traffic, and (3) the speed of the traffic.
This interaction is essential for planning, designing, and directing traffic.

Neurobiology data provide clear evidence for theoretical methods of studying brain development, making the study simpler and more accurate.
The connection between neurological and behavioral pathology is a key factor in the scientific research.
It has long been known that various brain damage, such as fractures, scarring, and bruising, can alter a person's behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technology has allowed us to observe, and to study, the brain, and the ways in which it has been previously unseen. . . .
It also provides us with a wealth of information and a set of brain-like structures that enable us to understand the processes that take place in our mind.

Computer-based tours with others are also a great way to reflect on the tours and share your experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina set up a website that shows their trip to the State Capital, and every year the website is updated, with the old ones being archived for future reference.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. When students start their blogging skills with a confusing language and misspelling, the presence of readers makes these changes.
Since the students are the most attentive, the reader and the reader begin to try to correct the contradictions.
The aim of the research is to provide the audience or readers with the information they need to be intelligent and enthusiastic (Toto 2004).
The gathering and gathering of information is a factor in organizing, and it puts students in a more predictable position than usual.
