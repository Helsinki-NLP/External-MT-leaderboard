Sananis are more medium-bodied cats that eat medium-sized baits, from rabbits to mountain goats and geese.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lazy domestic cats) that eat a large number of small baits like insects, rodents, mussels and birds
The secret of their success is the concept of kanam, the special work that they do with each cat to keep it out of competition with others.
The lions are the most social cat Sanans and live in large groups called herds.
Pryde consists of one to three adult males linked together with a female and a cub.
Women are usually close to each other and form a big family of sisters and daughters.
The lion herds act very much like wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are very lethal for their prey.
️ Like a six-dung athlete, a tiger can slowly climb (though not very good in this field), swim, run long distances and hit something five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is also placed with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar in the same group (Genus Panthera).
The roar of a tiger is not the perfect sound of a lion's roar, but rather resembles a sentence of roaring words.

Scientists imagine that the American Trail Leopard follows animals through its sense of smell and finds them to eat (bait), and by sniffing it tracks their tracks on the ground.
The American wildcat (ocelot) to hunt prey first hides itself in the surrounding environment then suddenly dives into its prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small community) is separated from the original community to which it belongs (such as when they move across a mountain range or river, or when they go to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment very different from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different abilities or adaptations in addition to what they previously needed, in order for a stronger competitor to count.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be considered of the same species.
What we call this process is speciation, which only means the formation of new species.

While most of their cuisines will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange and unusual devices including wild geese, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called the winter dream mouse.
Ensemble: While poor men and women sat in their chairs and ate their own food, rich men liked to host banquets together and have fun while eating their meals together
The ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that were brought in centuries later from America and Asia.

A civilization is a single culture observed by a very large group of people, a society, who live and work together. A civilization is a single culture observed by a very large group of people, a society, who live and work together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil which is related to the Latin civis, meaning city-dweller, and civitas, meaning urban, and to some extent also defines society.
A civilized culture points to knowledge transfer between several generations, a long cultural trail and fair diffusion.
Mini-cultures often vanish without leaving relevant historical evidence and cannot be recognized as worthy civilizations
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government under the principles of confederation - of which the Congress was the sole author.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judiciary, and relied on government officials, who often did not cooperate, to carry out all their actions.
No reference for abolishing tax and tariff laws between countries.
Before the amendment of these clauses, it was necessary to obtain the unanimous consent of all countries and countries also had to gain the positive opinion of their central government even in the absence of a representative.

In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes base in Ra in southwestern Taiwan, which begins a revolution in native grain production operations and employs Chinese workers Ra to work in its own sugar and rice plantations.
1683 - Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seizes control of western and northern Taiwan, and in 1885 proclaims Taiwan as one of the provinces of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, the Qing government after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) signed the Shimonoseki Treaty under which the sovereignty of Taiwan was transferred to Japan and Japan had the island under its control until 1945.
Machu Picchu City consists of three original buildings, also called Intihuatana (Intihuatana), the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Chamber.
Many of the outlying buildings of this community have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 70% of Machu Picchu was reconstructed and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed image photography format in the world is 35mm which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
35mm is actually a bit confusing, and 36mm is wide at 24mm.

Traffic flow study is the study of the movement of independent drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.

Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable and logical range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a logical consistency and this can be determined almost mathematically.
To better display traffic flow, relationships between three parameters have been defined: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) acceleration
Tos links help with planning, design and operation of road facilities
Insects were the first group of animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to produce better food and mates.
