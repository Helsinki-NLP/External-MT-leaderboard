The researchers say that the feather garment of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
The fact that the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed coffin, the so-called spole, but instead have other features of feathers rays and beams led the researchers to conclude that the spool was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but instead for temperature control or display.
The researchers thought that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample on adult feathered and not young dunes.

The juice from the boiler changes in hue depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).

When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists are using telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.

Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic animals) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, otters and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it from competing with others.
The lion is the most social of cats, and lives in large groups called flocks.
Flock consists of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like a herd of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are part of the same group (the Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but more like a sentence of roaring, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (change) through smell, sniffing on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with their dark vision and also move very quietly. They chase their prey by merging into their surroundings and then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat), they often end up in a different environment than they used to be in.
The new environment has other resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they previously needed.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.

Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their cut off portion of strange or unusual feasting items such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a kind of rodent called the hazel mouse.

A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, which also somehow defines the size of society.
City States are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture means knowledge being passed down through generations, a relentless cultural footprint and a just spread.

During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congressional powers were lacking to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it was up to the government of the states, which were often unwilling to cooperate, to implement all its decisions.
Nor was it authorized to abolish tax laws and customs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be added and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan, with its many islands, is often counted geographically as an archipelago.

1624 The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the original production of cereals, and employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
1683 Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the 1895 defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Declaration, through which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still-film format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
35mm format is somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The lateral ratio of this format (divided by twelve to produce the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) match or are close to this image ratio.
The much-abused and often-laughed-out rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
The best location for the subject is claimed to be where the lines dividing the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.

One of the principal teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.

Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the past two hundred years.
The UK mined international water to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the use of the EU-US submarine.

Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; every stage in China's history, or every family that sat in power, was a distinct dynasty.

During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history when thousands of people died in battle to take the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.

The same goes for the military, when ranks within the army were now based on calibers instead of class.

"Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond his daily life. He often visited a cave that became known as the ""Hira"" on the ""Noor"" mountain (light) to meditate".
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the killing pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Death Valley contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
Pyramid of Cheop was built to honor pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The marking for ""up-line"" looks like a V and the marking for ""down-line"" looks like a clamp or a square that lacks a bottom".
Up means starting at the tip and pushing the beam upwards, and down means starting at the fridge (where your hand holds the beam) and pulling the beam downwards.
A high pitch usually generates a softer sound, while a low pitch is stronger and more resolute.

They returned to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their wagon windows open at the fork.

The war costs of the American imperialist conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.

Naturally, the great gains resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple lords, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time period in which the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages period of European history during the 1000s to the 1300s.

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic that connects with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a course that largely lies beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are primitive, rather than socially conditioned"."

Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating from authors like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.

Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-reliance is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds from the ecoregion combined with interchangeability or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-employed, and so are many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called ""wild"". Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities".

Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness entirely on their own.

"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides"""."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on the farm in Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 pages of Dunlap that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.

Nearly all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Inner intoxication is not always immediately noticeable.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bagger is used in formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.

In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.

The main objective of science is to discover how the world works by the scientific method.
Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalist and philosopher focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all scientific matters, including psychology, was accepted.
When knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-moving oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.

The effects of mutations can vary depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natur-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.

In this dynamic shuttle traffic everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private transport.
Science now shows that this massive collectivity has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.

In developing countries, there are few complaints about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more basic happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the processing cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
As is well, drivers tend to behave nicely consistently; thus traffic tends to flow somewhat consistently and can be largely presented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, three main variables have been identified: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.

Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
The only insects that can't drop their wings today are the magic lands and the day lands.

20% of the water that flows into the oceans from the Earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a headwaters of 6,387 km. Its watershed is home to thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and construction techniques of Giza never exceeded those of the pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.

Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any pleasure hunt, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boat life is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat on every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most specific Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).

Traveling by air can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and reluctance to do other things that a lot of people have.

If goods have been sent by air, it may have taken several days for certain routes to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get there faster was to send the checked baggage. The airline rules don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you get the picture.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a lot of money on the privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).

Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been hit by ethnic conflicts.
1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any of the UN Member States.
The economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failures of political negotiations.

The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbour surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík village offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusually octacan church.
