The social card of a resident of the Russian Federation is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the preservation of the preference for travel in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for the organization of preferential travel of citizens using the social card of the resident of the Ivanovsk region is changed.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovsk region, the changes provide for the preservation of the allowance for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual calculations on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 "On the national payment system".
At the same time, the social card of the resident of the Russian Federation is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changing.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in trips, as before, but in the amount of funds, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in the winter not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now owners of social cards on receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of a preferential trip for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in force with the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for filling the social card with cash remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the expenditure of funds on the social card with accuracy to copies.
In addition, there is the possibility of refunding paid but unused funds.
We will also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when putting money on the card.
Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the department of road and transport of the Ivanov region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips with the use of social maps were made in the region, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens with the use of social card provided more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
While calling 911, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend
During a call to 911 with almost no shaking voice, college teacher Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that staff needed to come home to them.
Lamb stressed that there was a “dog” in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note negligently handwritten on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm very sorry, I'd like to get it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to officials signed by Lamb.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who was conducting two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to drive 300 miles to the university campus at the time, where police believe he shot all-respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the threshold of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Baford said university officials learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He that Lamb made that truthful call to 911 shortly afterwards.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day after a school shooting forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, authorities were still trying to put together the motives that inspired Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Goethe, where Prentiss was killed, said there were no allegations of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book he wrote, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "beautiful people" he met in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who was good at Lamb, Brandon Beaver, said he also seemed anxious and nervous, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Michael Sykes, that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 academic year about how he was dealing with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university admissions rules have meant that the doctorate, which Lamb has worked so hard to obtain, would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
William Laforge, president of the university, said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb cannot answer anymore.
Police attacked the trail of Lamba after his escape from the campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was able to be arrested, Lamb shot himself from a 38-caliber rechargeable gun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with a working engine was still standing on the road.
It was immediately unclear why Lamb came to the house, although, according to Johnson, she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009, and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received the doctorate of pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One longtime friend of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and fun man.
Carla Hayrston said she was 15, and Lambu was 20, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
In those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls were melting when he was around," says Hayrston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamp and Prentiss appear to have met for a while.
During a call to 911, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Goethe in a brick house, the rear side of which goes out to the canal.
Police say the dog is okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stein, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
“She’s completely depressed,” O’Stein said about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stein said he hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Stine said his daughter is writing music and singing.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs at the dimly illuminated The Julep Room bar in the suburbs of Goethe, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5 when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip harmonic for a handful of visitors.
Nothing suspicious was seen.
“It’s just a happy couple,” he said.
We had fun and joked about each other.
In the sense that they were both very intelligent.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, conducted seminars for first-time students and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
At the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a memorial ceremony of lighting candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
Crisis is over.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, and also in connection with the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire the same number of employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with a toy and children’s goods retailer assuring that it will give staff and temporary employees the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing candidates this month and will increase its staff from October to December.
Although there are still a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in the stores and on the sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" proved to be a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was notable also for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of the members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was obscured - next to me would be sitting Princess Diana," he said in a trailer for the documentary "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and then I think I’m literally at the distance of an extended arm and in one false snorkel from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it is undoubtedly the greatest film about time travel ever made."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN Secretary-General says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia’s military support for Syria, said that for the five-year conflict “there is no military solution” and that arms growth will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities "have made the situation insoluble."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in resolving the issue of Iran’s nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Survey Results That Prove Donald Trump Is Not Joking
Some tried to hang the label of a provocator on him.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some want a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to shake up Donald Trump’s high position in polls, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s two-digit advantage, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for a real estate magnate in terms of chances of getting nominated.
This is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
Nothing of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated for the Republican Party.
Experts point to the fact that at this time in 2011, Rika Perry was inferior to his successor Herman Caine, none of whom won a single state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super Committee for Political Activity and the Economic Conservative Growth Club acknowledge Trump’s unwavering power and begin to pull their dollars to overthrow it.
Here are some figures from surveys that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathy for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate magnate.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Six out of ten Republicans have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators gain the top in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there are polite to Trump.
Two-thirds of those voting for the GOP would have arranged Trump as the candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastically” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disappointed” if he became a candidate.
Ben Carson alone generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be “unhappy” or “disappointed” if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is massively criticized for his praise and insults, 52 percent of Republican-like voters across the country think the magnate has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he’s the same person who could be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person who can be effective in office, and six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republican voters are accustomed to this.
When they wear their expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely GOP nominee, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s not the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full Disclosure: GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a scattering is likely to play the advantage of Trump, and at the same time not supporting Trump is evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Cassich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who passed him?
Ben Carson surpassed the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump supporters say they have changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violent” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has become the topic in talks in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s poser will divert key Latino-American voters from the Republican party and hinder rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts public attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The disappointment of the government is taking new turns.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on approximately half of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll said they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also offended by Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republicans’ work in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “indignant.”
The government will decide on the fate of pensions indexations in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that a decision should be found by October 8, at the time of submission of the draft budget for the next year to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision on the freezing of the accumulative pension of Russians.
The amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and red?
Ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova responds:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eye from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The exit is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet wipes for your eyelids.
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the harmful substances accumulated in them for the day.
Cleansing procedures are supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salvia, chamomile), dilute the dense secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the fingers;
When washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear forces have developed a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country’s main nuclear reactor, the Yongbye nuclear complex, is operating “at full capacity.”
This was on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
North Korea is ready at any time to respond to "the aggression and nuclear threat of the United States", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
The last nuclear test by North Korea was conducted in 2013.
Plans to restart the reactor have not been announced since then.
Pyongyang claims it has developed a nuclear warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of brotherly peoples.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
This was stated during the meeting of the State Duma, reports "Russian News Service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers.
"The very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand," Zhirinovsky said.
The Deputy considers that it is necessary to remove all the four-steps, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the Tsar", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe will or will not accept refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
“That is the essence of the refugee issue,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is not possible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues, and as long as people feel safe.
"Thus, we can reach consensus, but we can do nothing until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
About 500,000 migrants have arrived in the European Union this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said the current migration crisis in the world is the worst since World War II.
It is not excluded that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group "Islamic State".
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to establish their own cells in the EU for conducting terrorist activities.
German residents organized a holiday for refugees.
Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees over the past month, although it recently tightened border controls to curb their influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the numbers significantly higher.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the town of Darmstadt, whose inhabitants give the migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn to Debute in Prime Minister Question Session
After Mr. Corbyn’s election, his debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Session is expected with great anticipation.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon speak to the Prime Minister for the first time, for the first time measuring forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions answered in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he may miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent while performing the national anthem in office on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has sparked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several leading articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had "standed in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief in the necessity of abolishing the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play Mr. Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements on economic, defense and international policy, while less than one-sixth of parliamentary party members supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political disagreements are also "growing up" in the Labour party after Mr. Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's limitation of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at a trade union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of restrictions as a whole.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labor and retirement payments, said the party had "complete clarity" that it was only opposed to the government's plans to cut the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met at the "courier box" in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to policy, said he had "attracted collective resources" to gather ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the County of Aylington North said the questions for the Prime Minister were unnecessary confrontation, and that he would also refrain from clever answers and exchanges, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the minister of economy in the shadow cabinet, will replace him on questions to the prime minister when he is absent – for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when possible, saying that he had addressed House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
Becoming the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of the “marathon mess”, often associated with the procedure of questions to the prime minister, but admitted several years later that he failed to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime minister have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons, and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say this has turned into a caricature and requires major reforms.
"Shot in Yoburg" Homeless Young People Learned by Photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.
But a group of former spyless people found a way to master the craft and make a living.
"I Was Captured in Yoburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the surroundings and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling rises as salaries rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to the offer to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009 and was met as a postponement to an earlier period of forecasts for possible quotation growth.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
On the overall background, SABMiller shares stood out, which rose by 20% thanks to a purchase offer from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9% against the backdrop of encouraging news from the competing luxury goods manufacturer group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales data surpassed all expectations and showed that sales in China – the key market for Burberry – have started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said it was able to raise $2.5 billion by placing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group shares were leading the fall in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
JD Sports shares rose after a sportswear supplier an 83-percent increase in six-month pre-tax profit to £46.6 million.
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hinder expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says the increase in the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
The costs could affect JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash Launches Initiative Campaign From Below to Fight Aldi Attack
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi attack in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up wholesale food supplier has launched a campaign to protect the market share of retailers IGA in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million injection by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale stores and the first of 120 stores in Southern and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo's, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to regular customers for South Australia Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, the day when this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual Investor Strategy Day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to be adherents to familiar routes, so the market here is more favorable to IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Africa and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all the players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of revenue and food sales volumes at a high level of fixed costs could cost Metcash about 13 million revenues before interest and taxes, Kirat said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this despite a recent Morgan Survey study finding that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, chief stock manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted to those attending a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash “could likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglas’s comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Metcash board of directors contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash’s revenue from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 retailers, has dropped by 43% compared to 2012 due to operational delivery and pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to match retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths at a thousand positions per week and helping IGA retailers rearrange their stores, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of branded foods.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says the price equalization and re-equipment of retail areas is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will net profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly hurt in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more respect than criticism for his behavior, as Tennis Australia president Steve Hilly says.
Kokkinakis, the junior in a talented duet and often referred to as the "Special Ks", involuntarily became the focus of attention due to Kiryos' shameful interruption with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the tower judge had to shoot Cockkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "Vavrinka was supposed to lay on the shoulder of Kiryos, and I was supposed to lay on the shoulder of this guy."
C. Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a seizure in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly has devotedly defended Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in a single-player break in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi has been dragged into the conflict," Hilly said.
“He really broke the racket when he got his leg off at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when hopes were broken, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he did very well in rather provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, and so on, and I’m sure he deserves trust.
He’s surrounded by a great team, he has a wonderful family, and I just think he’s been treated a bit dishonestly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he’s working a lot, he fits well in the team, he’s never had problems with other players, he’s respected outside the court, he’s training intensively, he’s in great shape, he’s a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing "ambiguous agreement" was the right choice for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the quarrels around [Kiryos],” Hilly said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, as evidenced by people like Federer and Marray, he grows in front of the public, he has made a series of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it is necessary to take him out of the center of attention for a while so he can reflect on them, and it’s best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes its border, delays migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and is detaining those trying to penetrate the country illegally to curb the flow of migrants.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants accumulated on the border territory, which was sharply reacted by the Serbian authorities.
Trapped indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke tents and settled in this area.
But the dissatisfaction grew.
When a police helicopter rode over them, migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian special purpose police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister has declared it "unacceptable" to deport migrants back from Hungary, as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the concomitant damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days,” Dacic said in Prague.
Unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in the crowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that a future agreement will be reached (near next month or by the end of the year) according to which EU member states will accept another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has spread across the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for immediate action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The declared state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungary’s Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjártó, said that his country plans to also erect a fence on the part of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata that even the prisoners were connected to the urgent work to complete the barrier between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “small spot” and crossing point of the European Union border for displaced people, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants looking for a more prosperous life, not refugees - victims of hostilities, who have the right to protection, and this view is sharply divergent from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now criminalize crossing or damaging a four-foot (13-foot) clutch wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for the government in the southern city of Seged, told reporters.
We make it clear: Illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still needs to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have been observing the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Orban’s national security adviser, Djerd Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border on the border, and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently under police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, pushing a railway wagon wrapped in a clutch wire to block one of the passages.
Unrest broke out on the main passage across the border near the town of Röske (Hungary), as Hungarians set up a office space to allow people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break inside.
Approximately 20 people managed to penetrate inside, while thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Sen. Bernie Sanders catches it.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to run for the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary competition, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided which candidate they’re going to support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than in supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support from some demographic groups, and Sanders has gained some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and the moderate, but that advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters before the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton surpassed Sanders by a two-digit figure among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point edge in that group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Per it’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, the views are more controversial – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it’s time for a female president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for that post (10 percent).
Hillary’s supporters also say she has an association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called agreement on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president is considering potential participation in the election, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race — although a third believes he shouldn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to present his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden is much behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, showed good results in some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton is in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a definite opinion about him on the matter.
Democratic primary voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden similar.
By all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal email box and server while she was Secretary of State are ongoing, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe it hasn’t negatively affected their general opinion about her.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinions about it divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the e-mail controversy hasn’t affected their overall opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion about her has deteriorated.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good grades in leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best score on honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest person rather than not, but as for Carson, many do not have any opinion about him.
The error limit for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national poll, Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates gained half the votes in a new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support percentage rose from 23% in the recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson climbed from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also revealed that Carson enjoys support across all demographic groups, pushing Trump in the group of Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, turned back along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Hakabi and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The error limit for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus-minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson’s rise in polls – showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with the rise in support for Carson last week, Trump made several critical strikes toward the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the campaign closure in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Murdering Baruch College First Student
Approximately two years after a college student was killed during a fraternal initiation ritual in the Pocon Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psy Brotherhood from New York Baruch College brutally assaulted Chan "Michael" Deng during his inauguration ceremony in September 2013 and failed to transport him to the hospital on time, resulting in his death," the police said.
Officials say the student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach the target by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited an hour before being taken to the hospital, police say.
They, however, found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national brotherhood president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members of the brotherhood began hiding personal property, essentially putting the brotherhood’s well-being above Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
He was not rescued and died the next morning.
According to the report, Deng suffered several dull head, body and hip injuries.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of devotion rituals as at least one student is killed during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury bowed in favour of the third-degree murder accusation for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against the newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all this officially or unofficially, then it too," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the nationwide brotherhood excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
Interest rates will rise, the bull market will crumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
That we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will continue.
Specifically for economics, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for 86 months.
The hardness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
That’s why the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising interest rates, but on how much it will take to adjust.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that all the vanity around raising rates is exaggerated.
“The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in his customer comment.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be a seismic momentum that many fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, expecting rates to rise can lead to instability for a while.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It doesn't seem that stock revenues have slowed by 12-24 months after the first leap, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
Specifically, the market is more likely to change sharply over the past 35 years — about 14 percent — in the direction of increasing rates, remaining fairly steady for 250 days after that (an average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returning to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock trading strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche say that the result for securities tends to not immediately become more pronounced at the rate-rise stage, and share revenues begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often play them contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point in all the time the raised interest rate exists.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few believe it will last long, while in the third quarter it remains at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "will it be different this time," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve all year round, while their eyes are tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could have approved an interest rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all interest rate hike cycles so far have been in the supercycle of increasing financial leverage with GDP, overcoming peaks that preceded the recession very quickly after the recovery began,” the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, all it has been 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is realised for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds the effect will come faster than for stocks when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the onset of the first increase/decrease in rates in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, the yield of bonds immediately drops,” Deutsche reports.
Strategy experts at Charles Schwab believe that rising interest rates will result in long-term and short-term bond yield levels converging, making the curve more flat.
High yield bonds often behave better in this climate, although “we’re still afraid of yield fluctuations,” says Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system’s policy.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a tougher monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market while the policy of the Federal System is tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run their main business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse position as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks show higher efficiency than the market within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with a stable financial position surpassed companies with an unstable financial position by an average of 5 percentage points for each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as shares with low volatility, also showed better performance than low-quality shares, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for “lowering standards”
It proves that it is becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just robbed with the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damian Collins, who hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the leader of the MPs said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it does at least something that commercial companies don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seems like the public radio station is “stupid” and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like to use the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else, here are two examples that first came to mind, where you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC CEO rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I’ll learn from Radio 3, I won’t know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and the creation of music is not really comparable to anyone else.
“I think Radio 3’s interest in finding new music and promoting new works is also very important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because British people are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to be attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Parliamentary member from Tory, Damian Collins, attacked The Voice, a music talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed in connection with a lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show featuring Paloma Fate and Boy George as judges was made in a “typical BBC style.”
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in its own home stall” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed down in August, and Black Friday could be the fault of it
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales boosted three years ago through mobile shopping
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could contribute to restraining spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been experiencing a boom, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs of alignment in online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed the lowest growth since it began recording in 2000, rising just five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of alignment in online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people got the opportunity to shop online, and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it is coming out on the plateau, and you can see a decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers could have refrained from buying on the eve of the event, which occurs on the last Friday of November.
Last year, more than five times the average number of buyers rushed to computers in order to take advantage of profitable deals, thus crashing down a number of vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real battle for profitable purchases, could have made people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
As for goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion shops on the central streets.
Muslims buried those killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and the family of bin Laden imposed sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after a crane crash.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world have rushed to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a crane crashed into the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, those attending the funeral filled the roadway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for a funeral, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the bin Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the crash of a crane in the Main Mosque, carried on the streets
Among the dead was four-child father Casim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when a crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane is out of operation.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the state news agency Saudi Press, says that Binladin Group is partially responsible for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but that the leaders of the company were banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why a crane fell into the main mosque yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crash, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of failing to use modern security measures and improper coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been among the roots of Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and has led major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda’s late leader Osama bin Laden was a traitor’s son whom the family abandoned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rains just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in their lives for every working Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials ordered to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irreversibly harmed.
The other victims will receive half of that amount.
The head of B&Q says the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money.
According to Veronique Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair professionals
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result - the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Rupert Steiner, City Chief Daily Mail Correspondent
They say the British put hammer and paint brushes aside, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint walls, it seems that these days you are in a minority.
Because, according to the company-owner B&Q, Brits are increasingly hiring specialists-masters to perform easy homework.
Veronika Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home decoration service network, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled masters from Eastern Europe, offering services at the lowest prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in crafts goods, and simultaneously close 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the weaker sex.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible to ignore the recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said: “Our shops are still mostly men.
Steps must be taken to balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about our purchases are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women in the leadership of the leading British companies whose shares are listed in the FTSE100 index, also changed the top management team, bringing equal men and women to the board of directors.
Kingfisher is the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including chief executive and financial officers.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women in the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took on the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a six-month decline in earnings and sales.

Time to Decide on the Federal Reserve Rate
The world is watching the Federal Reserve meeting, which for two days discusses whether to make the most important decision - to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that slightly more than half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve would do so now believe it would slow down and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior employee of the Peterson Institute of International Economy.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic rise adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for the change, but everything suggests their confidence is that all chances are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - hundreds of refugees are shouting at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed its border for refugees.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanović assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure a human treatment of them.
This is already a European problem.
To solve it is not easy, no country in Europe alone will cope with it, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said:
If someone calls himself a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents for this.
And if he does not, then he will not be allowed into our country, because it is completely safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orbán does not intend to stop at this: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already said that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maymarakis: “Europe wants to help us.”
Vangelis Maymarakis for a number of years was part of the center-right governments that, according to the left, led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he, becoming the temporary leader of the New Democracy party, is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election he met with the journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat, giving way to the Syriza coalition, but now, according to polls, “New Democracy” has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed over that time?
Vangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras expelled them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and Mr. Tsipras’s false promises.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Everyday life has become significantly worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this affected most Greeks.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The point is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been in place or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have gathered together to implement the program they have agreed on, without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted to support the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted to move Greece on the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences of the country’s exit from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by granting subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and help in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of Mr. Tsipras’s negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government within the first year of power wants to bring order, acts rationally and makes clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then, I am confident, all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to a recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the big investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
One example is the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were answered that the ministers of Tsipras never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded a unsuccessful deal.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you will tell them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we tried our best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have advanced reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price arranged by the Greek government.
I was the speaker of parliament at the time, I managed to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: A massive flow of refugees has moved through Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people are aspiring?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-action bomb that we will have to deal with after we win the election.
The reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act ahead, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And we are in such a situation now.
Even the interim government that replaced Syriza has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some emergency events that happened to them.
This issue has a profoundly humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee centres.
We must also use the economic assistance we receive from the EU effectively in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you very much.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka in the Donetsk region during the day employees of the criminal investigation of the Main Department of the police of the region together with the military counterintelligence established and detained the suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian military from the city of Krivy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who on the eve during the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict that arose in the village of Upper Yasinovate district of Donetsk shot from an automaton into his opponent.

The man who opened the shooting at Delta University left a note to apologize
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he would “comfort” the first murder and would like to “give it all back,” authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Goethe, Mississippi, that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the 911 service around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the controller that the police need to send people home to him.
He said, “I killed my wife last night,” and also mentioned that there is a “dog” in the house that “does not touch anyone,” but is probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened the shooting.
Arriving at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamp, 45, saying: "I'm sorry I'd like to get it all back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and committed suicide on Monday evening, as he was surrounded by police.
University rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something in mind."
Despite Monday’s reports that Lamb alleged a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday “lack of any information or evidence” of a “love triangle.”
O Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stein, who that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Stein said he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is “unhappy.”
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Lindsay Noulds, whom the San Gerald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the internet.
Noulse said Prentiss had a hunter named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Noulse said, “She always wanted to help people.”
According to police, Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to say that he "will not go to jail."
On the evening of the same day, when police caught him on highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, fled into the forest and there shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the university’s website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a PhD in Pedagogy from Delta State University.
Stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), experienced several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime companion, Faro Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this played a role.
Luke Shaw is out of Manchester United for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, because of which he will not be able to go out on the pitch for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno’s reckless kick in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV’s penalty zone.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double fracture and he’s in the hospital.”
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the next day and then operated.
It’s terrible – the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started playing fantastically, and then it happened.
He had an oxygen mask in his dressing room.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it’s for six months and the guy won’t be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not get a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
The referee, Nicola Riccioli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it’s worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad twist on both legs.
She tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words can’t describe how devastated I am, my journey to recovery is beginning, I’ll come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United is experiencing misfortune with Luke Shaw after defeat in the game with PSV
The defender of the English will have an additional incentive to recover for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coku, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When any player comes out with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't have any intention of hurting an opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you don't feel good," Coku said.
I had no chance to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) was touching it, but I didn’t see a kick under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
I am very hard and I am very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after a clash with Chris Smoling.
Does David Cameron know anything about “Lorax”?
Every parent is very quick to learn one thing: if your child liked a book, it will take a while before you get to know it almost by the mouth.
Probably unless you are David Cameron.
Responding to a question from a representative of a holiday holiday company about his favourite children’s book, the prime minister chose “Lorax” – an ecological tale written by Dr. Susan in 1971.
It was a tough choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the company's SuperCamps website, and continued: "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always finds some image or message that we miss."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to recount the content of the book, but actually tells the plot of a 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify a fairly short original narrative.
“In the high-walled city of All-Needville, where there was no green and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree,” we read in the text a description of the love story, unknown to Dr. Sue (real name Theodore Sue Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost like a brief explanation of the plot of the film "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled town of All-Nuseville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, according to general recognition, an active parent, so unfamiliar with the content of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how the environment is destroyed by the greedy tree-cutter and snatcher of the "all-needed" Nakhodkins, despite the protests of Lawrence (whose name is named in the title of the book) - a funny creature with a beard that "speaks on behalf of the trees".
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to an artist who had never read a book about Laurence to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments followed.
For Adam Lita, there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England national team, but it is still a difficult issue.
Winning over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the team that England has selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test series that happened last time doesn’t seem likely to me.
I would not rule out a victory on my field either.
Alister Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but among the beaters there are players who virtuously take the twisted balls, and the collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with them the scars of 2012, but only youthful positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, represents an attack option.
Adam Lith withdrew from England's test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Halez
The decision to remove Adam Lith from the team for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in tough conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges on the outcome.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said it before) players choose themselves best.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could have expected a longer career, but he was in power of his own fate.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bailey, was good at his mood, even when he didn’t show what he was capable of, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s first a team player and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the test cricket batsman leaves an impression is a difficult question.
Lith played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton had a chance to play on his own and on another field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in his best shape, but that missed opportunity is a past.
“Alex Hales is here, and he’s a Batman that I appreciate very much.
He’s the unpredictable cricketer we’ve seen at the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us on Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but that will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moane next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to put in an additional spinner while retaining four speed boulers, is being considered, and I’m not at all against it.
I don’t see a reason why a beating player can’t beat the ball there, and this leftist has already shown that he’s a fucking good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for its Wustershire county, but it has become the third number for them, and there’s no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as a “third batman” before coming out as the opening in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn’t look around.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a reserve spinner, and in my brief contact with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People may look at his approximate statistics – an average of 31 with a beat and 35 with a ball – and think it’s a risky bet, but among the spinners voting “for” a little, and the pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jaipurdin as a consultant for test matches could be a workshop.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring to it the richest experience gained in all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and relentless pace in the set-up.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coach job, and, like Mahela, has a considerable intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has already been said, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's fellow Darem Ben Stokes is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I don't have any problems with that, for example.
Although not everyone will agree with this, coaches and players do not set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never taken easily.
The camp of supporters of Britain’s exit from the European Union could win if the economy is in depression by 2017
David Cameron’s reckless policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is experiencing more and more difficulties every day, even without considering the election of the brilliant Jeremy – “Is it yes or not?” – Corbyn as Labour leader or the TUC’s outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigels Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained recently that in the situation in which the EU is now, experiencing various crises – not all of them of its own manufacture – some member countries are filled with the British egocentric agenda of seeding disagreement concessions and undermining agreed changes, which they mostly do not want.
Having gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that it didn’t want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it “the selfie program of Dave and George.”
The prime minister and the finance minister ride at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves in the background of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It is all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain interested inining external contacts under the umbrella of the European Union – “Don’t leave us with France,” says Berlin – suggests that ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don’t care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s very cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation gets worse for her, as it has gotten worse for Thatcher (11), Mitterran (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses strength.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of the skin to help “selfie Brits” whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to boost the process of Britain’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
“The revision was a fixed idea” and “Britain received nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations.”
Europeans, unfortunately, know what a predator Fleet Street might be, and how skeptical the media magnate is about the EU, unlike the time of the Tony Benn referendum in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They may bluntly remember Boris Johnson, a rooted European opportunist who became famous for his “direct banana EU” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a colorful company of fearful tax scammers, alien phone hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of the same opinion about them, but realized that when you are in a cage with a bullish gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Miliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair ceded to the principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But the gentle Jeremy Corbyn, who gently knocked me on the back at Westminster on Monday — I told him he didn’t have time to waste it on me anymore — seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock’s “Murdock boycott” strategy from the 80s — a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose air force sofa he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official stance on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditionalist tendency of Ukip and the wider circle of "Little England supporters" among the Tory may probably say yes to it.
It’s the same thing that Hillary—”Benn, but not Bennit”—Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy Scout refusing to acknowledge that Corbyn’s appointment of the unbearable John McDonald as the “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought his best on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour cabinet, without going too far and without losing his post in the cabinet.
Hillary’s battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “under any circumstances” – Benn’s phrase – is not what McDonell said, and not what J.K. said to pars and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his “boyfriend” Corbyn wanted to say—remember, he even touched me—the discipline of messages remains important in the era of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the watershed of social media, the focal point of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily by allowing him to take Labour’s support as a must during the referendum campaign, McDonald said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misconception of McDonald’s and Corbyn about EU membership – within the “Bennit” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism generated by a minor difference is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is unwavering that J.K. will not advocate for a withdrawal – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their heads at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend their political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on concessions to Britain, when all this can be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed with British weak military operations in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting spending, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize e-cigarette review from Public Health England
Statements by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were heard at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
The PHE released an important report, a “turning point” last month, calling it a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
A editorial article in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the “extremely hesitant argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these statements have “solid or solid grounds.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Kapwell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of health care is that rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects PHE’s statements that “current best assessment shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” to be based on detailed evidence analysis and simulation.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people who gathered to develop a model of multicriterial decision-making analysis to summarize their views on the harm associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are briefly presented in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
It also confirmed BAT health certifications in the Sustainability Report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, not to mention the funding he wasly previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for choosing the board members was not provided, but among them are several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also claimed to finance the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco department at PHE.
The scientific paper published by the group "excellently agrees" that there is a lack of "severe evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Kapwell.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Kapwell said PHE’s statements that “at the moment there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that responses to BMJ’s statements had already been given.
He said: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One in two smokers died of addiction throughout their lives.
All evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we should continue to study the distant consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not prove, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
Having made it clear that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only cause some of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our duty to the nation.
Former Channel 4 chief says BBC should stop EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chief Luc Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give much for such successful shows as the soap opera about Albert Square.
Johnson noted that license fees should only be used to create such programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably only seen by a small percentage of the audience, at peak broadcast time when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to work more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to work with the BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
"I can't get rid of the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programs that could be shown by competing companies that don't receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the House Communications Committee as part of a discussion on the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep a license fee, which I don’t think is a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should leave only those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is broadcast in the prime slot, because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one should show it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would give a lot for her.
I don’t understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don’t think that would humiliate the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings “because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows coincide with comments by Sky chief executive Tony Boll, who in his McCarthy’s memorial lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the BBC’s more niche public broadcasts “continued to go on to the BBC4, where it was often impossible to estimate the audience, but the company’s function was fulfilled, and this could be presented as an argument in the Hanze sermons justifying the income from the £4 billion licensing fees: “Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching.”
They put them in a slot where nobody will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee the following: “I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom £150 is a big money, I wonder, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should rethink Rita’s mission in favor of “informing, educating and entertaining.”
He noted that now only a small portion of the BBC's material is formally classified as educational - according to him, it's 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issues of partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "The Radiant Concerts" (only part of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change their direction when they are affected by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulses act by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Control Brain Activity With Light
Scientists said that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Cholasani, a researcher at the Salt Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalassani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worm’s body.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are connected to them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that could be controlled by ultrasound, Chalassani made genetic modifications of worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and turn off neurons using light impulses.
Chalassani argues that compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain via optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves unhinderedly pass through the tissues of the body, so they do not need to pass inside the cranial box for delivery.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal for a while," Chalassani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements harass British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International’s video of a protest against the arms exhibition.
Fantastic killer drones!
Destroying the iron candles!
The cassette bombs.
Electric light-noise bits that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The bold voice and animation leaves no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms exhibition is a vicious parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the British government’s intention to “push” weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the defense technology and security systems exhibition taking place at the centre of ExCeL in Docklands.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of numerous posters at bus stops and in metro trains that require to look at them again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of them with the fonts of the London metro with the image of the DLR line turning into the silhouette of the tank.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will rush to the DLR line.
The 300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy Park Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London, using a “advertising space hacker set,” a 6-pound set of hook keys that is claimed to “give access to approximately a third of the advertising space on the planet’s bus stops.”
Transporters in London were upset by such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and striving to bring political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists start working with protest movement activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by pro bono VCCP agency, with the participation of a graphic designer and sound artist, also working for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Leaver was stunned by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition – with a pass on the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s make them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but “filling her houses with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting.”
“They helped us to bring attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Per the most creative art on the theme of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed information about the order of "AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder", received from the U.S. Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative warfare that brings an unparalleled reserve effect inside the target."
Whatever he does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Student Accommodation
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it’s only now that I recall the tense smiles of those I annoyed – and the numerous, long complaints on others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can vary from slightly nervous to absolutely scary.
He encourages talking: telling people where you came from, whether you took your academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you “honestly, neither love nor hate Marmate, because, seriously, guys, it’s just HAHAHAH’s yeast extract, I’ll be with you.”
and rest.
And help others to rest too – ask questions and show interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people you like, not those you’t even talk to, even if your eyelids were burning and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often transformed into drinking houses, midnight cinemas, and places of common fun, but they are also the place where people dress up and repair underwear.

Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of swimming from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long-term friendly relationships.
It can be a hell for those who are trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can regain the energy I spent on communicating with you.”
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - and not knock on him, but send a SMS.
On the other hand, about the knock: do it.
One guy in my hostel followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with the help of cakes.
Since you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking at the door to people to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I have baked you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Offering home dishes is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly blended pieces of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, taking someone’s chicken is theft, but is it theft to take a little milk for tea?
Take care of the milk owner.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be ashamed, even if he is boiling from anger inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying, and I’ll sympathize with you – but try to treat it more adultly than my neighbor who poured dishwasher fluid into her milk to avenge those who took it without request.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or studying.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
A girl in my corridor asked a neighbor to slow down the sound of the drum and bass guitar, as it was 3 o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the noise.
When he finally silenced at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, then sparked his music and locked the door behind her for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, would it not be extraordinary, to bite your elbows, to take a neighbor for your future spouse, to get caught up with him, to break the relationship and to see him every day, and to watch him pull all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you will not order the heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys inside your own locked room, the line between the joke and the joke is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but turns into its opposite in a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something – but never pack someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close someone else’s door and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer – but don’t stick someone else’s stuff with the Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after releasing an update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, select General, and then - Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that “App update failed.”
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival dies or try to update through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space – but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the execution with a dedicated utility that suggests removing apps and reinstalling them after the process is complete.
It is important to make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger when you are updating to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because discharge of the phone in the process can cause the update to fail.
iOS 9 Review: The least impressive and best update for iOS 9: How to prepare for the new operating system for iPhone
You should make sure you check out our checklist of the steps you need to take before downloading to try and get something to stop going wrong, and protect yourself from it if something goes wrong. iOS 9 now includes new features, including an enhanced personal assistant, and innovations that improve iPad performance, as well as settings that speed up and fix the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia’s military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about this with the Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia’s continued support of President Assad poses the risk of aggravating and prolonging the conflict, and has a negative impact on our common goal of fighting extremism, unless we continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power,” the State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the US commitment to fighting Islamic State in the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the U.S. “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in attempts to counter Islamic State.”
On Friday, White House officials said they do not know exactly what actions Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is about to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will raise the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime a “loss rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
“But he didn’t listen to my warnings – and as a result the situation worsened,” he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating vehicles for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was by the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergencies, the FSB, the Federal Trade Service, and Rosturism - to prepare proposals on creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their ships abroad – about €200 million annually goes to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes", which provides for the provision of full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, Lashkina noted.
This issue was submitted to the Subcommittee on Customs Tariff, Non-tariff Regulation, Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption at import is in essence an advantage.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting of the subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes, include goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in the field of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for rendering international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, scenic costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and workshops, water skies, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious rites.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they prepared mandatory resolutions on the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Theodosius and Euphoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of the entry and exit of small-size, sports sailing and hiking vessels to the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has given instructions to the captains of the sea ports of Crimea to ensure the application of the simplified procedure for the entry of small-size, sports sailing and hiking vessels into the sea port and the exit of the listed vessels from the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the waters of the maritime ports of Crimea.
Regarding Yalta and Theodosius, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of agreement, - noted in the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia is extremely difficult with yachting because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole industry that is constantly developing, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, everything is in place.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhika, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area there are extremely strict rules of border service: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, you need to obtain a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht has nowhere to go.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there is a problem where to get it, says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.
As for yacht storage places, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the start of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was by the press service of the international organization.
“The new financing will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimyo Fan said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the grant of a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
In prisons, they are asking for separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council of the Federal Punishment Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015, among other issues will be discussed the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in the colonies.
This was stated by the member of the council Vladislav Gryb.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not determined their gender, it is possible to provide for separate chambers, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Gryb emphasizes that determining the punishment of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convicted pass appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is really a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Gryb is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving the sentence.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in SIZO (where the accused are before the court decision) separate chambers for transgender persons are provided, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
This is the only way to deal with such criminals.
Unambiguously, they need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in conventional chambers is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSSI employees.
Humiliation of transs on the part of camaraderie members is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Gryb.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with an undetermined gender, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
There is no need for separate prisons - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Gryb explained, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, transgender prisoners will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are detained at the place of the crime, so the receipts of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and the court process are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Gryb.
On the eve, law enforcement officials were unable to decide which investigative isolator - male or female - to determine the 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), who was detained for drug storage, because of which a man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a signature of non-exit.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as there is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in CISOs and colonies in Russia yet.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender punishment, noting that abroad it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as is the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alekseev.
Prisoners should be safe, so separate blocks could be made in the name of that and for homosexuals, especially since there are more in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to make themselves transgender in order to get into a colony different from the usual.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wanted to change gender, - said Alekseev.
A person can feel anything.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgender persons to be sentenced, I doubt that prison staff will be serious about the safety of such persons and get into the subtleties of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony could greatly delay the beginning of serving sentences by convicts.
A commission is created - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long observations, this is not a single test, on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry allows for this.
Therefore, before changing gender, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they accurately show whether changing gender with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the convicted, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then we can say that transgender people are even fewer, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes are a very small number, - said Lordkipanidze.
Now, on a petition before the administration of the colony, homosexuals and transgender persons can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world championship in chess.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the world championship in chess for juniors up to 20 years has ended.
The end of the game was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was able to push the Polish Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who seemed confidently went to the title.
The victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The world championship in chess, which has been held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who gave a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system of 13 rounds), confidently seized the leadership.
Given that Duda was the ranking favourite of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he will miss the gained break was very insignificant.
And even when Duda reduced the turnover and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the backwardness to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the struggle for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that’t help, win Duda’s game.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to non-obligatory mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who met with Benjamin Bock, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player reduced the confrontation with the Dutch in a draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
And that is why it is him that the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, the governor of which Natalia Komarov, traditionally pays much attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the main prize.
But in the girls' competition an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buks.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag behind the champion in 0.5 points.
It is changing the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As noted by the general director of Vimpelkom Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being carried out in order “to remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with the TV channel "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce in Russia "tens of percent" of staff.
Rospotrebnadzor inspected 78 Burger King snacks in Moscow and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsky highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment on the Great Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
43 foodstuffs violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic maintenance of the premises, non-compliance with the requirements for the ventilation device, in some establishments, bacteria of the group of the intestinal stick were found.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to OOO "Burger Rus" owner of the network "Chocolatica" Alexander Kolobov, in Russia operates 293 snacks.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said that the agency opposed the indexation of 10% tariffs on freight transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by JSC RZD.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say: it’s wrong, it’s too much, reduce your expenses, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money to the left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “much stricter” proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put-option on shares worth $300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of the issue of shares in favor of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to make an option or to demand additional payments.
Details of the talks in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasišin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Construction, said that the ministry, together with the Central Bank, is developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.
"We understand that this is nowhere to go, so we are developing a corresponding mechanism," the official said.
The screenplay of the film "Citizen Kane" will be put up for auction.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History announced plans to auction black versions of the script for the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works of director, screenwriter and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Kalabas on September 29th, it will present three black variants of the scenario, the estimated cost of each of them is $ 20-30 thousand.
The first of the sketches, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevič, is the earliest script in private collections and titled "American" - such a working name was in the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Addressed food aid will not be the analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Evtukhov said that the targeted food aid program will not be analogous to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern addressed food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase “food card”.
I would like to note in particular that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed food cards with the reflection of past times of total deficit, a card distribution system in which the quantity of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it will be approved, we will propose changes to the legislation”, – said Mr Evtukhov.
Earlier, "Ъ" wrote that the program to introduce food cards for the poor has been introduced to the government.

This year, the survey of the Association of Russian Managers "Top 1000 Russian Managers" comes out for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year’s rating.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as the current year’s ranking candidate and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is offered to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be advisable to add to the overall pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following managers of the functional areas of the company: financial director, commercial director, director of marketing, director of personnel, IT director, director of public and corporate relations, director of relations with authorities, director of corporate governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on the branch principle is carried out on the basis of the branch classifier of the Association of Managers: information technologies, commercial banks, forestry and wood processing industry, engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-professional holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password for entering the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and can submit their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional area.
The methodology for building the rating is based on the principle “The best choose the best”: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert committees.
To the full-time meetings of expert committees are invited all desirable candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of past years.
Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of senior executives and eight commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of expert committees, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are preserved strictly according to the Internet rating and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make up-to-date adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms "Ъ".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes are possible in the status of managers and companies.
The convenience rate for investment loans is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market of lending to small and medium-sized in January-April this year fell by 40%.
How do you estimate the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the loan volumes of the IFS significantly decreased.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Loans below 25-30% were not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, then now it is impossible to do this: the rates are cloudy.
For, the current level of interest rates on ICO loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return.
A rate of 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive return on them.
How much, according to your estimates, is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans met?
Following the downturn of the central bank’s interest rate, the situation improved a little.
Loans have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have begun to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to control the flow of funds.
At the same time, if there are financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy supply costs.
All this, in the end, allows the company to make its products more competitive and maintain business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the lending market that will strengthen and affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the Central Bank’s policy, and now the regulator is showing consistency in the question of lowering the key rate.
However, there is no need to expect a radical fall in the price of loans for the MSB.
In the current situation, the problem, in the first place, is inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the central bank drop.
If we talk about the level of delay, then traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises, limited both in the possibilities to replenish funds and in the options to correct economic behavior, will pose a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant decrease in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphs.
It is beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
The new crossover CX-5, however, and any other model of the brand: it is attractive on the outside, technically perfected inside.
Japanese already simply because of its "Japanese" is able to bring attachment to the products of the country of the rising sun to a state of complete enthusiasm.
You can bring as many arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and one will even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will dissolve from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
To quote from the course of Bassé, to spice the food of wasabi, to collect katanas and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Per, the Japanese school uniform is the only shape that girls wear with pleasure even after graduation.
It has amazing properties: sensual and strict at the same time.
The older the girl, the shorter the shirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But the appearance of the car is much more changed by the new design of the headlights and rear lights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a plaque of rigor.
No need to call the police.
In the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience the stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 l. c.- only 5.9 l. The power unit is completed exclusively with an automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to ensure that you are not on the spot of your own accident behind the CX-5.
In order to further increase the comfort whileining excellent handling, the suspension has revised the design of the front and rear amortizers, as well as optimized the shape of the inlet of the front lower lever.
The system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds was reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It’s different if the girl cheats in a swimsuit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing fighter.
Attention will then get no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and rear seats, which provides optimum space for both wide shoulders and long legs – whoever has anything.
Even the long-legged will appreciate the fact that the fountains in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the twists.
Mazda’s largest range of active safety systems is available on the CX-5.
To recognize the potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There is also adaptive lighting, and warning about leaving the lane, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggage compartments in its class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of outputs, it can accommodate a load of 561 l. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate lifting lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 l.
The costume of the character of the cartoon in Japan is called "Kiguru".
The pyjamas look especially stunning.
Everything can be in it!
Of course to sleep.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walking with such a beast on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is a choice - fun clothes, behavior or a car.
Thank you for the help in the preparation of the material store Kawaicat.
Kiev broke the nuclear union.
Kiev officially formalized Ukraine’s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday voted on the second attempt to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project has not been implemented.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law dissolving the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth blocs at the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The bill was passed by the government only by the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of the parliament spoke in the re-voting for the bill.
The Hmelnitsk nuclear power plant under the USSR, according to the original project, was to have four power units of 1 GW with reactors of the type VVER, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on reconstruction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and in 2011-2012, the Rada adopted the corresponding laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the construction of the blocs would have to be borrowed from the Russian side, but the funds have not been allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curb relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsk NPP and the project of building a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have survived is the procurement of fuel from the Russian Federation for the current Ukrainian nuclear power plants (providing about half of the production of electricity in the country), since for the time being Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" can not replace Russian supplies.
Plans for the completion of the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been abandoned: in 2014 in Kiev, negotiations were announced with the Czech Skoda JS.
UN Secretary-General opposes the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be settled by military means.
"There is no military solution," he said in response to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he will hold a meeting with foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be on Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not rule out the possibility of creating a future Air Force base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
“But anything can be,” said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, the U.S. that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military aid to the official Damascus is necessary for the fight against the banned in the Russian Federation terrorist group "Islamic State".

The OSCE PA is reporting a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PAS) Arthur Gerasimov said the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the southeast of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “return to the normal life of our countries.”
Asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the "Normandy format" or in the format of the contact group at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was conducted, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have essentially not changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of dialogue has become more positive.
Parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates, played by party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections came from representatives of the KPRF, who accused the polling station of "covering for falsifications".
Opposition comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the election committee refused the party "Communists of Russia" to organize a referendum concerning the abolition of the fee for the repair of apartment houses.
The Municipal Electoral Committee officially presented the results of the elections to the pride of Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1,03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746,7 thousand votes were issued for voting in the district commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Twelve seats were allocated to the political parties according to the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six seats in the pride belong to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorno.
The only mandate of the LDPR received the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the KPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and Deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of "Fair Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he moves to the next candidate on the list.
The chairman of the elections committee, Alexander Makiev, told the members of the commission that he was introducing duty days for "sending telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" on the subject of refusal of mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, representatives of the KPRF stated multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the municipal election committee with the right to a consultative vote from the KPRF, proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that on the order of the head of the administration of the Sormov district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
Inside for a long time could not pass neither the deputies of the State Council, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, and the resonant scandal with the assault of the door of the district administration was shown on TV.
At the meetings of the district committees all observers and members of the committees with the right of advisory voice had the opportunity to attend.
The head stopped access to them only when the vote was over and the district committees had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was repaired, and at all the meetings interested persons could be present," pared the member of the municipality committee Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally held the deputy of the assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of local elections on the election day began to seal urns at 6-7 o’clock in the morning, laying in them ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right to vote and the observers were not notified, so they came to the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists believe that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations in the urns could uncontrollably throw ballots.
However, the municipal election committee, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makiev, did not find any violations with the dumping of unregistered ballots.
Members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova through the polling station to come out with amendments to the regional legislation to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, contact the Central Committee," advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makiev.
At the end of the meeting, the Chairman was accused with loud accusations by the member of the KPRF Sergey Samokhin, who shouted that the polling station ignored dozens of complaints and covered falsifications in the elections.
"You are not here at the rally, be careful to declare!" - the chairman of the election committee was offended.
The protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election committee must approve the general results of the elections, after which within three weeks the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group for the conduct of a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to raise two questions for discussion of the people of Lower Town: whether they agree that the fees for the repair of apartment houses should be "immediately cancelled", and tariffs for housing and utilities "freeze until 2020".
However, the Duma lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of "Communists of Russia" is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx revenue is mixed, lowering forecasts for 2016.
FedEx disappointing results in the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground shipping division.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares dropped by about 2.5 percent on preliminary exchanges 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
A decrease in the forecast has been observed despite an average 4.9-percent rate hike, which will come into effect on January 4, and a rise in land cargo charges, which starts in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to last year due to cost cuts, increased gross revenue and an increase in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "worked steadily given weak economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
Plans for hiring for the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly as many as they hired last year.
For the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Revenue per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the international freight sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express shipping division.
However, the boom of online shopping has dramatically improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transportation increased by 29%, but operating revenue remained unchanged as a whole due to increased expenses on large shipments and self-insurance.
The express shipping division received higher revenues due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector revenues fell due to higher wage costs.
At the preliminary trading, about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling 11 percent over the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot Honduran red tree table, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated two-storey meeting room, a wall image of the United States will hang above them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in a forecasted decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented boost provided by a near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows a confident economic growth, recent shocks in the global financial markets could keep the already cautious Federal System executives from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration," said Lindsay M. Piega, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"H, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market would be enough to give them an excuse to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself is provoking fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 percent likelihood of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that those making decisions do not soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The rise was triggered by expectations that those determining the Federal System’s strategy will leave the rate this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“It would be a surprise if the federal system raised rates at this point of time,” he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve will do so, “they will have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike could calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System appeared to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slowly tightening financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite liberal complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, growth in the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the federal system considers full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s 2 percent annual target, the Federal System’s leadership said the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake in late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by as much as 16 percent to a record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy could hinder global growth.
The market has partially recovered this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high of May.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, the market upset further complicates the difficult calculations of the period of the interest rate increase.
“Without information about what’s happening in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they’d be turning the hooks at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences may be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China,” O’Learner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve System has become the world financial power.
The influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
Only a hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “dime” its monetary expansion has shocked markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that Federal Reserve executives will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zakari Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “there have been cases of excessive reaction to financial market movements in the history of the Federal Reserve that seem to be unrelated to economic principles.”
Laker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited identifiable consequences for U.S. growth,” Laker said.
A year later, the heads of the federal system canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should prioritize stability only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic was not close to that level, he said.
“You’t want to be in a situation where you’re frightened by rising rates because the markets are in shock,” said Poseen, president of the Peterson Institute for World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the events.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East, so that the waves of refugees will flow to Europe.
This opinion he expressed to journalists in Ulan Bator in the framework of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I’m not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises by itself: is not Europe the ultimate target of those who, with such manic persistence in recent years, have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?” he asked.
"Someone probably assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unhappy and deprived people who are escaping death, will head to prosperous EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Have many European political leaders openly stated about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which now literally overwhelms their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO undermines many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially watched and watched how the military boots, tailored to NATO standards, are also crushed by moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” he said.
The government troops and their loyal militant groups are confronted by insurgents, consisting mostly of Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The United States supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such insurgents to be terrorists.
The Syrian president called the reason for the hostility of the West to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in interviews with RT, First Channel, "Russia 24", NTV, "Russia Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian newspaper".
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another person in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland.
Assad drew attention to the sharp twist of Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West to an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad in the fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant Western statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves – then at the demand of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the president remains, otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, economics and military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units are being deployed to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military equipment.
"Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
As for the rest of the countries, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Isis coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of dead exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist group "Islamic State", banned in Russia.
The international coalition headed by the United States is carrying out airstrikes on ISIS positions.
In Utah, 12 people died from floods.
In Utah, at least 12 people have died as a result of floods.

Three children were also to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in the search and rescue work.

US Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This was by Reuters with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools for “further isolation of Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, reports RIA Novosti.
As by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov in the course of the conversation with Kerry once again emphasized the need to create a unified front to fight the terrorist groups operating on the territory of this country.
It also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, a number of bilateral issues were addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow’s increased support for Assad.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander on Strelkov.
Former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic Alexander Borodai denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview to the correspondent of "Lenty.ru".
The note in the Washington Post is beautiful in that it’s all overwhelmed.
Former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, nobody connected and "goed out" he from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without three pieces of money, which are attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Borodaj, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really went.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” said the former head of the DPR government.
Borodai stressed that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "bound".
I suspect it is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that Strelkov left himself," Borodai said.
"It is a slander on me and on Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post appeared an article in which stated the words of Borodai that he carried Strelkov to the territory of Russia forcibly.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to bind his associate.
Polish authorities began searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish forestry workers have begun cutting trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, cleaning the forest is necessary in order to verify the reliability of rumors about railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of the gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to encircle the search area.
Three days earlier, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Petro Zhuhovsky said that local treasurer with a "99 percent probability" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewelry will be discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Valzhich with the message that they found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The main narcologist of Russia has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts detrimentally".
So he said in a live broadcast of the radio station "Moscow Speaks", commenting on the information that the Speaker of the Soviet Federation Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
Man grows unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for it.
He is mentally ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21," said Brun.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Thrise Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told Izvestia that Matvijenko supported the initiative to raise the age rate for the sale of alcohol and "agreed together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the site of the upper house of parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to be checked for compliance with the Children's Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development", the correspondent of Sib.fm was acquainted with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible from the "Chitai-город" store on the Red Prospect published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Prosecutor’s Office of the city of Novosibirsk.
A response to the request of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, this is a very fundamental problem that will shake society.
It will begin to read the Bible again, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method with which it is going to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of babies sucking their breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children get all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant women and women who have given birth are recommended to increase their daily calorie intake by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, recent research shows that a single increase in calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, negative effects of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system have been identified.
A train hit a school bus in Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that stuck on a railway route.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that he could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, there was a clash in their eyes.
It was filmed by one of the students.
There was panic among the students.
Some children started crying and running along the sidewalk.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, miraculously no one was injured, except one passenger of the train, who received minor injuries.
The damage caused by the accident is estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors have banned boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of the local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, the 28-year-old Brown died of injuries received in a match with the Philippine Carlos Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles according to the version of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali's victory with a knock-out in the 12th round.
Brown was taken to the hospital with a cerebral injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to a life support device.
On the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two losses and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Brandon Smith died from injuries received on the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, and it is better, from her point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” said Stephen Parnis, the organization’s vice president.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when an athlete receives a bleeding or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional organization that brings together practising physicians and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergey Naryshkin called unacceptable the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly session in Ulan Bator.
We evaluate this as unacceptable actions, as an assault on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and the ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue," he said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA members to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Return morality to politics.
Let us bring dialogue and law back into the practice of international communication.
Let us bring humanist ideals back into a democratic world order.
“Doubleness has never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the parliamentary assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First, the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our interparliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also said that it is necessary to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," he said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
We the victory for a couple of days.
The world champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphant for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed on his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers to defeat the team championship of Europe, set several records, and the main thing - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking the third place in the overall ranking.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the outgoing season.
Is the season for you not over yet?
Yes, I’m going to perform at the World Military Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I’ll think about rest.
True, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a very different state.
It’s easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passions after the main start of the season boiled away, the burden of responsibility no longer presses.
You can compete for pleasure, for relaxation.
You know, the holidays are coming soon.
Is there fatigue?
The season is special, lots of positive emotions.
The fatigue at the end of the season always accumulates.
It doesn’t matter what he did more, winning or losing.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, transfers - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now my emotions are on the rise.
What is there, I am just happy!
When you finished the world championship in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens .
And you, journalists, don’t let me forget that.
But in general, I think that bad is the athlete who lives on old victories, turns his successful races over and over again.
We the victory for a couple or three days - and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can’t say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He first trained at home in Barnaul, then at the collections, then again at home.
All as usual.
But with the coach, the task was set: to try to get to a new level that I haven’t been before.
Almost all the winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did general physical training exercises, which included pulling and seating, and we pumped the back.
Then I took on the barrier training, did a lot of technique.
Have you watched the competitors?
I always try to do this, in the age of the Internet, there is no problem with this.
I watched the winter European championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole piedestal was taken by the French!
I thought: I need to do something to dilute this company.
With every start in this season you added and added in the results.
Was it confidence?
All of my last seasons have been roughly the same.
I don’t run 13.20 first and then 13.50.
I always develop my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily aimed at this outcome.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show your readiness does not always work out.
How was it at the Olympics in London?
I, frankly, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not get to the final. - "NI") tried to forget immediately.
It was really good, I could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best result at the time, he would have become a bronze prize winner at the Games.
But not lucky.
Do you remember your first world championship?
And how then?
It was in the tag.
I really wanted to go to the final, there was such a maximum program.
He dropped straight from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to crush and bear a broken head means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championship in Moscow, he was already in the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold already then!
How do you manage, developing a decent speed, not to lose even the head, not to turn off?
And that is the most difficult thing.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most awful, when you have the feeling that you are running and everything goes by itself!
Honestly, it is worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious successes tend to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
At home is better.
I can’t imagine where I am without my coach.
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together for a long time?
From the age of 12, since I came to athletics.
Specifically, I first trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's multi-fighting was when they throw a ball, jump in length from a place.
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run, the norm of the second adult class was met.
So it remained.
Have you ever been afraid of barriers?
I immediately agreed with them.
There has always been a lot of work done on technology.
How much I suffered in one run!
But this routine is nowhere to go.
The technique needs to be constantly refined – so that at night I could be awakened, I would immediately get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your run in Beijing says it was a very beautiful run.
thank you .
I liked it myself.
Usually I don’t review my races, and I couldn’t stand there.
But efficiency needs to be worked on - there is no limit to perfection.
Do you not fear now that the victory a year before the Olympics will fall on your shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, you should not feel any extra burden.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kusanashvili
Well, I am not so naive that I am surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them with bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I did not wrap the flag, and the same, exactly the same, I spoke a million times here, and directly called no one a fool, - another affected me.
All my pseudo-friends got in a moment, somewhere evaporated in a second.
The pressure I am subjected to is so strong that even I, having seen the kinds of guys, think white people are hugged.
As if he was going, he was going, and you were attacked by a crowd and muted with sticks.
But you have to know me, I am not a room eagle, I am a fist, I am hit from a haubice, I am old, guys, to be afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, but now...
The best thing in me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And to give passports to such fools as Fred Derst or Monson, can only fools.
For me, the best journalist, the job is not shameful.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kusanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something in no way fits into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It’s like coming to a neighbor and taking his home.
The war from the Kremlin went, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from a bitch from the Kremlin.
I guess who it could be...
Cobson did not have much to live.
I don’t understand why he’s the greatest artist and why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Will he lose his apartment?
They destroyed a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh Leads the Ranking Despite Ninth's Attempts to Illuminate Leaders' Loss at Today Show
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's visit to Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement to release the leader's seat failed to raise the rating of Today.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the state after Malcolm Turnbull defeated Tony Abbott.
The competitor – Sunrise – featuring David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distant torture did not seem to have much to do with Australian TV viewers, with the Sunrise audience counting 397,000 in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience at 339,000.
Today was slightly higher than Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has shortened the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
Today had 318,000 in August compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against 314,000 in Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change influence more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the clarification!
Posted today on Monday, September 14, 2015
Important news for Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former star of the series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics argued whether Thomson could cope with the popular show alone, without the star of the Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday’s evening was a loud “yes” answer.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure were mixed in the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television show, led by Andrew O'Keefe, attracted 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number jumped to 623 000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of Chase Australia attracted 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour - overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia’s ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to overtake McGuire's show.
It was originally published as "Sunrise leads, while Today remains on a local level"
The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but whom will he choose?
The secret revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snowden Markoski may have accidentally revealed who of them will win in the Cholestick.
The woman with whom Sam Woods will eventually stay in The Cinderella is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, keep silent about who exactly of them got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snow Markoski, and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls should be left, they may have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, joy as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, their answers to the question, “If not you, then who should get the last rose of Wood?” could involuntarily suggest which of them actually won the heart of the “Chopper”.
Jefferson-Fellows and Marcoski called Mackey the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from the first day.
“From the moment I joined the group, I felt the energy and energy of Sam and realized they were very close to each other, and I didn’t have any doubts about it throughout the show,” she said.
"Sara is a very open person, easy and fun with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McKay herself said that through home dates last week, she realized that Wood may be “the same person.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it wasn’t just a game – I believed him with all my heart.”
When asked who Wooda should choose, if not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snowden and Lana deserve it equally.
The show The Bachelor is released on Wednesday at 19.30 on Channel Ten.
Originally published under the title "Sara is Sam Wood's Best Choice?"
Jared Hayne had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in them after his move to the U.S., as did many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Heine chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bar for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the panda in the winning game against Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed his player and gave Hayne another chance to get back the pant, and also involved him in the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself from the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of arranging an entertainment for the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Heine also received support from special team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jared Hane lost the ball on the return of the pante by the Minnesota Vikings team during the first quarter
At such a start of the NHL debut, Heine and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not expect.
It was seen how Heine was mourning as he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the hosts of the show "Hemish and Andy" on the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to his career in the NFL.
“That’s what happens, you’re just thinking about the next game and that’s all,” Heine said.
Heine compared his failure to his debut in the Origin series of games in 2007, when throwing a ball in his counting area brought the Queensland attempt.
In the end, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Heine took a photo with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of using weapons at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy stopped.
There have been clashes between migrants and police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees organized protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water meters and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants are throwing stones at police and trying to remove a fence on the border.
Reinforcement is directed to the scene of the clashes, police take action in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive on Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for consideration of applications for asylum.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian parliament will also consider the issue of transferring the functions of border protection to the armed forces of Hungary to the parliament of the country.
In late June, the Hungarian authorities began building a 175 km long fence on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian has admitted to the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
Accused of the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to the theft of more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial at a federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman admitted to a conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Those defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security," U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman is facing 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When issuing a sentence, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian citizen and may reduce his term.
Drinkman’s verdict will be announced on January 15.
Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smiljanets, was detained.
He denies his guilt in the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk of Russia’s support for the regime of Bashar Assad.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad exacerbates the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks aggravating and widening the conflict and undermining our common goal of fighting extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the State Department said in a statement.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (the activity of which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
The White House has threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
On the eve, White House spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it does not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition, which conducts an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has frequently about the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians to master the equipment to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened a rubber bullet fire on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began firing rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, approximately 175 miles west of the country’s capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dakhal, the head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of one of the police offices, some throwing stones and ignition bombs.
Mr. Dakhal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such a high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of fierce protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where representatives of the Madeshi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the people of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10.
In August, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, this was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been governed centrally for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company with 900 jobs.
Syansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects he told the correspondent "Oblastny".
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start your job as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of local budget funds.
A municipal property audit was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document circulation to five days.
Previously, the papers on the instances could go for months.
Measures were developed to increase the income base and optimize expenditure.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no project documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD for the roads, kindergarten, northern sewage collector and water supply.
Road work in two areas is already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demographics in the city has not been seen in the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens is one of the most urgent today.
Since September 1, the capital repair of kindergarten No 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed.
The estimated cost of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year after the renovation opened kindergarten No 23, which now attends 200 children.
The repair was carried out on the terms of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the program "People's Initiatives" helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged one and a half to three years.
We do not have rows for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be engaged, first of all, Sayan enterprises, they need to provide work.
Already in October a 60-apartment home for orphans in the Leningradsky district is put into operation.
As for construction, I will add that Syansk is one of four cities in Priangarya that entered the economy-class housing program.
All necessary documentation is prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
In total, we stated about the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing Wants to participate in the program are very many.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes the finish "at the key".
If we manage the set amounts, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a fee.
We are working with the Prosecutor’s Office to contest this transaction.
The land under the object is federal property.
Work is ongoing with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares into regional property is resolved, with subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the project 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a big support for the city.
Has the Institute of Social Partnership been developed in Sayansk?
We have approximately 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects were achieved thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by such enterprises as JSC "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminska TEC, LLC "Syansky бройler", LLC "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the City, OOO "Sayan Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out the repair of the horse yard, where specialists are engaged in children and therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city of ZAGS.
Sponsors helped colorfully celebrate the Day of the City.
As in the old good times, a parade was held with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
The yearbook of the city, the book of Sayan poets was published.
The pioneers and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded anniversary medals.
They also participate in the work of the City Charity Fund.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from poor families.
How are personnel problems solved in the social sphere?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
In order to solve the personnel issue, the provision of housing professionals is of great importance.
Last year we allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received service housing.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the possibility to privatize it in five years.
In the plans - re-planning of the building, which will be built another eight apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
Construction of houses for employees of the budget sector.
The most important thing is that there is a working team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all the crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of social pensions taking into account the growth of prices.
The State Duma has submitted a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the growth of prices.
The author of the document - deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyancev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum of the pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions taking into account the rate of growth of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to 1 February, and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA said Mogherini on the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, the OSCE Parliamentary Speaker Ilka Kanerva stated that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly’s events are unacceptable.
This was stated by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator Nikolai Kovalev.
As TASS reports, in support of the position of Canerva were collected signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece.
"We have already formed a strong enough support," Kowalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly intended to collect signatures of deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kowalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the EU’s governing structures and “send a corresponding petition.”
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape is 60 percent.
A broad front of a low-pressure area approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern edge of the Green Cape Islands has a 60 percent probability of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area, roughly in the middle between the Green Cape and the Little Antilles, also has a 60-percent probability of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, meteorologists from Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a double donation campaign designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping flooded European countries refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-characteristic personal approach by announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We went on dubious trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working for refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million donations until the sum on the google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity can help obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with mild obesity suffering from type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
“Mortality statistics don’t show up at all right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in JAMA Surgery’s column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal with a value from 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery – stomach shunting and hand gastrectomy – with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains approximately at level 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% partially.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, complete cure from diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial - only in about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, average hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best glycemic controls, reflected by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the group that had completed a sleeve gastractomy, the shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decrease in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was approximately 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with a BMI below 35 to be interested in such a procedure.
"Here, the report is very important because it claims that such surgery is safe in a low BMI group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once a patient’s BMI falls in the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they have accumulated the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse that.
The robbers took 9 million rubles from the house.
The robbers attacked the residents of a house near Moscow and stole from them 9 million rubles and three female shoes.
This is by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people through the open entrance door entered the house located on Gorky Street, bound the 20-year-old son of the housewife and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three socks.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case under the article "Theft" was opened.
Europeans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the 2018 World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not yet in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to come up with how to relocate all the guests of the city.
Rosbalt's interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting rental apartments will grow by 10-30%, and after the championship for rental housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the primacy, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it meets the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hotels are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the request of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has examined 138 hotels and now plans to launch 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens, placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now on the account literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30,5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to first deputy tourism development committee Nana Guichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many checks have been carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny, by a surprising coincidence of circumstances, is unknown.
That is, there may be more passing classification, but nobody knows about it.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification," said Catherine Shadskaya, Director of the Northwestern Branch of the Russian Tourism Union.
This is due to the high season, during which hotels earn the most money and do not want to engage in other affairs.
Another reason is budgets in which the costs for checks were not laid, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status, from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But lately, hotel managers have intensified and started applying for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels must have time until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will also not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the stars will be developed a fixed fee for the hotel room for the time of the tournament.
The formulas according to which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done in order to prevent prices from rising by 200-300%, as is happening, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow the promotion in two or three times, but the hotels must be allowed to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixation corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how much this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better than a restless journey,” he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma submitted a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We are very hopeful that this law will not be adopted or will not affect St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that the hostels should be preserved,” says Nana Gwacia.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then approximately 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and at the moment there are 1,5 thousand rooms.
According to the president of the Federation of restaurants and hotels of the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there is a lack of two- and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a breakthrough towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation when "75 thousand VIPs are sitting on the 80 thousand stadium".
This can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiotism": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but the visitors can not."
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it’s like a hotel where guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the football world championship and because of their rush.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the hole is digging itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
"The companies that can conduct this procedure are not so many, so they will give up less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive", - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of passed checks at the moment are much higher than those in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is due, among other things, to constant changes in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to the harmonious work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely to have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
On the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to arrive in vans, in which you can spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will then empty," said Gennady Lamshin.
Also great popularity during the football championship will be rented housing.
Probably a reserve of rental apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"It is obvious that the first will be housing near the stadium," said Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Agency for Real Estate Development and Research.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the people.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, in which people not only indicate the road, but can also make a mini-excursion.
There are complications too.
My dad in the year 1970 in the courtyard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They found themselves not having a place to stay: it was difficult to sleep with hotels at the station.
"And dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added that now such a feature in the inhabitants of the city is not left - calling home is full of consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hotels and governments will have to recall the past?
Zhirinovsky merged the Amur region.
I watched the clown of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma today with admiration.
He did such things when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and is still in excellent shape.
The theme of the speech, apparently, is "the protest of the LDPR against the results of elections in the Amur region".
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; other protocols, except those signed by the election committees, the LDPR, apparently, does not have.
Here he raises the second-place Ivan Abramov and cries something like, “Here is the winner of the election!”
And right away from nothing he throws on Rodnina, and then, after a mess already with the chairman, drives the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all with your fronts trolls and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Really Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another outcome of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Podonki!", and not a protest of the political party against the results of concrete elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party’s website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader clearly leaves the subject.
He allows the dead in Amur themselves to bury their dead, and he himself preaches the gospel against "United Russia" as a whole and the innocent Motherland.
Elegant decision, so that the face does not lose, and in the actual, not a showcase scandal do not go.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange situation.
Apart from the screams from the bosses, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on hand.
He - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle, it was he who became a formal occasion for insulting the respected champion, and, more coolly, ham attacks against the EP and the ONF.
And there, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional one-mandate district, he can turn into a paria, which has been used successfully by his own party leadership and super-irritator for the same ONF and the party leadership of another.
It is certain that there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should be invented and respectfully observed.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom fell out of nothing.
The subject of Abramov was buried under him.
Very beautiful really.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in countries where refugees live.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford, devoted to ethics research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the present circumstances, the interests of mankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has highlighted Germany and Austria's actions in response to the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you must think about long-term solutions to bring true peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the harsh U.S. response sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be solved through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and it caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
The number of children who have swallowed hand disinfectant has quadrupled over the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have a 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age swallowing a high-alcohol hand disinfectant, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of ingesting hand disinfectant fluids by children under 12 years of age to toxicology centers have increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children come into contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the ambulance,” Lopez told CNN.
He explained that some children drink disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant as a cheap drink.
The teenagersly mixed the disinfectant with an alcohol-containing mouthwashing fluid to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
“The child doesn’t think it could hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfecting liquids) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfectant liquids for hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, orange, which are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant contains somewhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high concentration of alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology center at the Kansas University Hospital.
You’t just leave a whiskey like that, but people keep these hand disinfectants in mind, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naisha Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a disinfectant with a strawberry-aromatic scent in the school, was sent to an ambulance for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naja was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” said Orthoria Scott, Naigi’s mother, to CNN.
It could be deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand disinfectant fluids from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic non-declared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active substance.
In January, three four-grade pupils in northern New York plotted to poison their “against” teacher by “sparing antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand disinfectants, and she has forbidden to keep them in her class.
Police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk" and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children’s library named after N.K. Krupskaya is a wool of iron.
The children who come for books try to feed her with candy.
I have been visiting this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twentieth years of the last century organized loud chats here, put performances on Majakovsky's poems, conducted literary lectures and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, "the friendship between Nadia Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaula" became stronger and stronger every day.
Hope Konstantinovna even sent a childhood photograph to distant friends in Barnaul.
And when the Barnaulists asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna did not object that the library be named her name, she wrote that she did not, did not object.
Letters have long been burning in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose this harsh profile adorns the baselief on the library building.
During the years of reconstruction, different people often called, outraged: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of any good children’s writer, without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as the "Leninskaya" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library hall is a path of yellow brick.
"The Sorcerer of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Earlier, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all the other managers was different only by the love of drawing.
Then I found an advertisement on the Internet: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and was called "My Cancer Mommy."
Olya made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children’s books of writers around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in a book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space.
But there are children reading to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - tells "Russian Planet" director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we even had such a moment of confidence that a children’s library is needed, and it will live – the kids are going here!
Interest in reading is returning.
In the hall of the library hangs a large exhibition window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter new photographs of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
In the library, they are pleased that fathers are increasingly coming with the children.
If at two years a child read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-olds from issuing 12+ books.
To get such a book, the child must bring with them parents - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of beasts with yats and eras, the story of Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the sewing of "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only a conceptual space of “book temple”, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, - explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can come to read, play, and paint together.
We made a play area for the kids - the child just comes to play, and the hand still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they stand on their feet, do not want to leave.
Often mothers come with wheelchairs - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all other places to come with babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Modern children like us once, love classical children’s literature:
"The publishing industry is now developing, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations."
And if we talk about small children, it is important for them that there is some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly releases booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
Books are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
Carrying books outside the reading room is prohibited.
This magical privilege is only for children.
In the most remote room of the library there is a square lounge with an ancient wooden staircase into the basement, in the book store.
The stairs will scratch under your steps – it’s already a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet like with an old comrade: hello, good that we and you do not change.
Ally still joyfully walks along the road paved with yellow bricks, Toli Ryzhikov's lazy steals magic light bulbs, and Malchiš-Kibalchiš never said to the cursed bourgeois of the Military Secret - this is already his firm word.
Such books are like passwords, by them you can find yours anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the warehouse - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of books with yats and eras.
Or tell Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or the “Murzilki” for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, colored them in tea color.
These books are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I all dream - I will retire and deal with rare children's books.
But children, so to speak, will not do this: and the colors in the old books are not very bright, and the themes ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write out this “Pioneer Truth?”
But it was still interesting, - says "Russian Planet" Galina Iljasova, head of the library.
The pages of "Murzylki" have darkened from time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been in charge of the library throughout her life.
She knows the colour of Buratino's hood, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the quidditch championship, in which situations Carlson uses a motorcycle glue, and who works the father of Alice Selezneva.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and everyone who can live without these books very quickly find a different profession.
Only the most persuaded remain: educators, teachers, servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed to be a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of a conversation, he’s a professional.
I generally love children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be, to stand exactly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical novels, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations.
I think in my childhood everything was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me then.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought the library was a magical place.
I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be there, despite the riders.
And I am glad when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren...
Rumor Mill: There are no disagreements in the Celtic
Griffiths dismissed talks about disagreements in Celtic after Della admitted that the Hoops were in a bad position, but he would fix it.
The Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons increased their advantage over the Celtic to five points.
The penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittsburgh, which allowed Donce to separate from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denies talks about disagreements
This sparked rumors of disagreements in the Celtic, which were cut off by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates did not suffer from any heightened criticism as they prepared for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we feel the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title.
Former Rangers midfielder and former member of the Dutch national team Ronald de Burr said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtics because he does not compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Bur, currently an Ajax representative, said: “The most attractive moments of the Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands, and why?”
This is because there are no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They are talking about the “old company.”
They’re talking about both teams together, and that’s what interests them.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
“I’ll change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dalla has admitted that Celtic is experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
After the defeat from "Malmo" and, as a result, withdrawal from the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 players "Aberdin", which now, breaking off by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale said: "Selica has had bad times before and we will go out again."
Now we want to get out of that as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.
We too, but we have to go on.
And we really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warren Buffett awaits January transfers
Despite opinions just a few weeks ago suggesting that he has defined some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warberton is suspicious of the January campaign, arguing that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in "Celtic", hinted on the end of his career
Swansea striker Mitch, who was linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Lebbons expires.
The 29-year-old has suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
"Harts" are going to oppose SFA over Neilson's statements
The Harts led with a score of 2:1, when they removed Paterson, and began to lose 3:2, but the defendant's red card was later cancelled; this is Colum's third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on his words, claiming, "I have not questioned ethics, I have not commented on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynacsl
The stubborn player of the team "Hybernian" received an excuse after admitting that he sang a song with insulting words about the former player of "Harts" Rudy Scacell.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburne district of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at Tynkassel in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," the attacker said, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to go back to Tynecasle if he doesn't play for Celtic.
Donelli: Tannadis board confident in the management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donelli claims that the board of directors of Dandy United is still confident that the team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the worsening situation on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to go out again,” Donelli said.
McKinnes is pleased that he won “unpleasantly” at Hamilton
Derek McKinness acknowledged that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to a seventh consecutive league victory, putting them five points above Celtics, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to the penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team here that won anything – a cup, or a league championship – that didn’t win the match in this way.”
The unemployment rate among Scots remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 in the period from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the UK overall increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than the UK level of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of employed now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland dropped over the quarter to 74.0%, above the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Minister of Foreign Affairs David Mandela, commenting on the latest figures, noted: "The long-term plan of the government laid the foundation for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvement in Scotland’s labour market with increased employment and decreased unemployment.
Why I'm a Witness to the Oklahoma Execution
Today, avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in the viewing room of the death chamber in the Oklahoma prison when Richard Glossype will be executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I was afraid.
So why do this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more wishing people than seats, the results of a dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I cannot do it.
I’m going to sit with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we got our own relationship with him after several months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of being impartial.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated better,” but still believes I’m wrong in what I’m doing.
Richard Glossype disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I’t do it, even if he spoke.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this matter, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I will not go into details here again.
I can’t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of contributing to the crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is not guilty of the murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his execution was wrong.
From that perspective, I will see him die.
I can’t say I’m going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to whom this can be addressed.
From me you will learn what it’s like to watch the person I like die without necessity.
Police persecuted man persuaded to escape the Canning River
Constele from the town of Canning Valley managed to persuade a man to climb out of the Canning River, and to remain dry.
The resident of Perth intended to escape the police, but failed, trapped in dirty water on shallow water a few meters from the police officer, trying to "softly persuade him to go out to the shore."
Canning Valley police were summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When police noticed the suspect, he tried to escape them by rushing to Canning.
But he did not sail far.
“He was standing in the water and saying, ‘I won’t go out, let’s catch me,’” said Chancellor Shandell Castle.
Constable Laklan Perhavetz did not really want to wet his shape, so he used a safer approach - "talks with a good policeman."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says the senior sergeant Kasldane.
Football champion Ben Cassins remembered this.
In 2006, Cassins drove to the quintet to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts turned out to be futile, but prompted the locals to invent the joking "biathlon" of Ben Kazins.
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to withdraw from horse sport
Peter Moody accused the Racing Victoria stewards of trying to infiltrate a spy into his stall last year and threatened to immediately leave the horse sport.
His target was the stewards and staff of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign personally against him, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start due to drug abuse on the start day, on Wednesday, was the last spark.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he is always doing his best to participate in racing, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lidarie cobalt test, which he can’t explain.
He has held the tongue over the suspicions of espionage for one and a half years and didn’t want it to “look like green grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve endured it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you out of track so much that you can’t hold back,” Moody said.
They know it continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to endure the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know I’m doing my best for them.
When they start to think that’s not the case, then I’ll have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his staff.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call if asked, and offered him a job in my staff to share information about what I'm doing in my staff," Moody told Racing.com.
They obviously think I’m a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all, undoubtedly, file a claim because they failed to try to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moody, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, current CEO of RVL, knew this all the time and know it now.
Shouldn’t that make me think that the matter becomes personal?
Shouldn’t the RVL have the courage to take responsibility for what’s going on in this business, other people besides the coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I’m saying now might make them think about it.
But I’ve come to a point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
I am really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put responsibility on them to make decisions.
I have support from my family and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew during a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidarie case, and the latest removal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition "laughable" after the horse's legs were compressed with clay, which is a breach of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules of racing.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made a compression on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could get it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of compresses, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
This is an anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but that’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who crashed and escaped from the scene in Cobra, arrested
Police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobra in the weekend and fled from the scene.
The motorcyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, the 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalya surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, not providing assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobra, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy dismisses accusations of using harsh force techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception of the ball "imposing the agenda" on the part of two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during Storm's sudden victory in the Sydney qualifying game final on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on Storm after his team won the qualifying tournament final at the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, when he called the game “typical” for the rugby league and stated that two of Queensland’s teams were not “too successful” in a handball fight.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and stated that they were simply focused on "contacting" intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was inspired by the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are concerned about a possible defeat from Storm.
“This continues to pop up – I haven’t heard Trent Robinson talk about the tough techniques when they beat us 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our systems or defense techniques for a whole year, just over the last six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s obviously training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and it’s been a bit of a shock for him.
Funny, as it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that Bennett's "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" won the championship in 2010 by showing "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielder with their speed.
It’s a football you’d like to play when you have such players.
He made that note in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two such midfielder like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat disturbed by playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rutgers game was a competition with more points than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the count? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is it an impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
For me it is a routine.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm has a weekend at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Kronala Sharks next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of possession of drugs released under bail of $200,000
A man who is facing life imprisonment for trying to confiscate 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht travelling from South America through Vanuatu to Cumberland in August.
During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen on the fence, and later he met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is threatened with life sentence for trying to seize drugs in a quantity sufficient to sell, Maximovich's lawyer claims that evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch is absent, and that the man could be in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should be released on bail.
The latter has connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
Maximovich’s mother and father-in-law were asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“From the testimony of both, it becomes clear that the amount of the $200,000 bail is too much a financial burden for them,” said Flanagan.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was released on bail on condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passport, will be registered in the police daily and observe the command hour from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Fotis Kacicaris: "I am proud of the national team of Greece, which fought until the last seconds"
The head coach of the national team of Greece, Fotis Kacicaris, paid tribute to his team after the match of the 1/4 final of the EuroBasket 2015 against Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game, - quotes AFP Kacicaris.
We were preparing for a great game with the Spanish.
We tried to work out in defense, but defensive mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It’s sad, but I’m proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: “I will be assigned Kaun’s functions at CSKA”
CSKA novice Joel Freeland said he does not believe in the curse of the army.
He also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euro League next season.
I’ve talked to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team,” said Freeland. – In fact, I will be assigned the role of Sasha Kaun, who has left the team, both in defensive constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I’ll be able to cope with it.
Yes, it will take me some time to rebuild to the center, but in the NBA I played more forward.
Now you will need to face the big center rivals more, but I have done this before, so I think, and now I will do it.
The Army won the Euroleague last time in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but they have not been able to show their best basketball every time.
There is a belief that the team has been shattered.
This is the whole game, you can’t win forever.
Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we are going to show the best we can do, then we have a good chance to win the EuroLeague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Moscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I’m not a superstitious person and I don’t believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, everything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Luis Enrique: "The match with Roma will be special for me"
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament against Roma with special feelings.
According to the coach, the match between his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained the wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show himself from the best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome after a few years, for which I gained some experience,” said Luis Enrique.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It will be a special game for me, but it’s not so important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with a victory.
The August match at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the upcoming match.
I expect from Roma the game she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It’s a strong team that knows how to press and what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: “Krasnodar has various options of attack actions.”
The duties of the head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodar" noted the diversity of the attacking schemes of the team of the opponent.
According to the mentor, the "tours" have in their arsenal several models of the game in attack.
The match will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see, - cites the official website "Ural" words Skripchenko.
We have a week of preparation ahead.
This team has different options of attack action, performs their attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time and we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the eve of this game, considering that Krasnodar is holding a match of the Europa League against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: “Astana can take away the glasses of anyone”
Astana midfielder Roher Kanyas after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament against Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team’s game in the future.
According to Havbek, in their field, the Astanians are able to take away points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - cites the official website of the UEFA. - We were a little less courage in the attack.
Benfica is higher in class, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking their points.
It is quite real.
But you have to think about Galatasaray first, and then Atletico.
In the home games, we can take away the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I’ll repeat as many times as I want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
The head coach of "Real" Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League against "Champions" (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was difficult, because "Shahter" knows how to own the ball, - cites the official website of UEFA the words of Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks always hide danger.
I will not say that Real played perfectly, but we had plenty of chances.
I am pleased that we didn’t miss the balls and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.

Stephen Hogg used a girl’s phone to force pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was asleep, signed up for an internet messaging service, where he received a series of nasty images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which immediately drew the attention of her mother.
Police arrived and saw five images, then searched the computers found at this address, and found "relevant" queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told police that he did it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a police officer to scare them."
Commissioner Eileen Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff’s Court: “He said it’s addiction, he’s addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that he was making queries on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about talking to an unknown person who sent him pictures, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did this to tempt them.
He said he had problems with his head when he drank and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then with the accused was held a full-time bet.
The girl was interviewed and that the accused used a computer and a playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, admitted guilty of allegations of making obscene photographs of children on June 14, last year, breaking the terms of bail on January 25 of this year and failing to appear in court for the hearing on March 24.
The defendant’s lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be included in the list of persons who committed sexual crimes, as it can be proven that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alister Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, until he received certificates from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was detained before hearing on other remaining cases began.
He was included in the list of persons who committed sexual offences before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe speaks wrong in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from the stairs leading from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall scene instantly spread on social networks.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they received anonymous threats warning them not to whisper Mugabe during the appeal.
A month ago, they whispered the president during his speech to the nation in parliament; this was Mugabe’s speech repeated on Tuesday.
Innosent Goneze, a member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning Mugabe not to interrupt his speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death,'" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary immunity does not work.
A member of parliament said the party headed by Morgan Tsvangirai was "preoccupied" with threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly growing hardware and service sectors.
The deductions resulting from the projected job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business areas will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable comprehensive technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
The company was formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is undergoing a major reorganization with the aim of moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies work better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support traumatized Jack Wilshere before playing with Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it is only September, and that provided that Wilshere's recovery will go as planned, nothing will prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshere will surely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The worst part of this recent problem is that Wilshere confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season preparation.
Wenger: “This injury does not threaten his career.”
It’s not just a completely healed bone.
Nothing serious .
It is just coincidence.
It’s not related to ankles or injuries he’s had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 games in the league over the last five seasons.
If you look at the layout for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs with the most missed days due to injuries.
Wenger acknowledges the likelihood of being trapped in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you get back in shape after an injury, you’re vulnerable for some time – during this time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough.
I hope he recovers physically, I’m confident of that, and that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games against Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the team.
Ector Beljerin and Aaron Ramsay did not come to Croatia, so Matteo Debushy and Arteta will most likely play in the start-up.
Wenger may also include Kirana Gibbs and Olivier Giraud instead of Nacho Morales and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favourite in Group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 matches since they managed to play last season as the Invincible.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake with a strength of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson learned last season when the team lost in a Champions League game against Monaco, and remains with a weak hope of bringing the club to a victory in the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate the need for honesty has become for men, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men is at the highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only leading cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, with men occurring three times more often than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Unfortunate Lives has declared 2015 the Year of Men with the aim of challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of healing double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chance of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, in order for friendship to work, first of all it needs to be.
In an age when communication is driven by social media, when style is preferred to content, speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even when reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values – money, image, social status – all at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noticed, money doesn’t buy happiness anymore.
The merit of Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was not defined by their work, but rather by the personality that appeared in communication with friends.
Joey’s humour and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’s breathing on Rachel – all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me, "...my role as a listener for people who are depressed and suicidal stresses how even the slightest communication with friends can be beneficial."
Often those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of “living with this” is strong, as is the feeling that talking about problems can be perceived as weakness.”
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-running overcoming mechanisms.
It highlighted the little sighted moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger, speaking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, and long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.
So, if you’re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend where the holiday has completely restored the decorations, why not take your friends a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better – if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say “Hello.”
You can’t guess what the benefits of friendship can be.
Friends show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Mathieu and Edison Cavani, celebrates the goals in the goal of Malmeo.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed the PSG to easily bypass Malmeo on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and the game reaction.
Angel di Maria and Edison Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their game in the Champions League with an extremely comfortable 2–0 win against Malmeo at the Park de Prenses stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first Champions League game as a PSG player began to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a series of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal at the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shaker in Group A, Money needed to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, as they aimed not to qualify for the playoffs, but to continue a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the pitch in a game against a team from his hometown and club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy - to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win with a score of 2:0, bring the opponents trouble and play well in defense - it's a good start, even if there are more points that we will need to improve during the season," Blanc said.
It is promising.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret not having scored one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the shifts in the Paris team, which brought her a 2:2 score in the match with "Bordeaux" in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player able to take the PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought off from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran out on the pass from Marco Verrati behind the defense of Malmeo and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villand to the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from the PSG then they had to be disappointed.
Malmeo, which defeated the Celtics in the playoff to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the pitch at the start of the game, five defenders and two support midfield midfielder, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nikolai Georgich’s blow, in which the ball flew past the distant gateway of Kevin Trapp at the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
However, the PSG sometimes deceived itself with unsuccessful transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to realize at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
Nevertheless, he proved to be much more skilled in precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having received which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted blow, which passed into the strap past Villand at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the clock mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic fixed the ball sent to the center of the field from his left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmeo had about returning to the game, and only Willand's interception of the ball from close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final count before the replacement Esquire Lavessi did not count a goal at the end of the match.
Malme coach Aege Harede later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian told: “Our last Champions League game took place in December last year.”
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory for the money!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, Xi’s first visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama’s arrival in Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also welcome Xi Jinping and his wife, Pen Liuang, to a government lunch on the evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.

The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18 in Sochi will be held the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus, in which will take part the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor.
About the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcomes of cooperation tells the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shugla, who was part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on fruitful cooperation of regions – important links of relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
In the framework of the plenary and sectional meetings, we will discuss the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this testifies to a successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of profiled ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
The first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The significance of our work is also evidenced by the fact that a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the Tiumen region APC visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of the Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, we talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of supplies of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
The problems in the work of the Tyumen trade house "Belshin" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
We talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of JSC "MAZ", the development of the service center of JSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of JSC "TPATP".
The conversation also touched on preparations for the trip of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another theme of the conversation was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tiumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promises to go to a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the city administration of Tyumen, Alexander Moore, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing in the air", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed, which will work on gas, ecologically clean fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Lift Factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products JSC Mogilevliftmaš, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the program to install new elevators in the regional center.
In the framework of the expansion of the consul’s powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment to Zauralia was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a landscape for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they allow to directly and quickly solve many problems, relieving their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present circumstances, it is extremely important not to break the butt, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of filmmakers
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that consideration of ethnic composition is not necessary.
During Sunday's release of the show Project Greenlight on HBO channel, the famous actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the screenplay chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you cast for the movie itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Shaken Brown, not believing her ears, exclaimed insultingly "Oh! nothing to yourself. well" all the time while the actor from "The Martian" gave comments in live broadcast.
To discuss the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown joined co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what interpretation of the Harmony image they are going to adhere to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white snooker.
The producer of Dear White People advocated that the film should be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho; Damon was sharply opposed, saying that "in the end we may not get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with disapproving comments addressed to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on what was shown in the video: "The explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s remarks appear precisely when competent coverage of racial topics in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the candidates in the "Album of the Year" nomination at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“The albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be treated as a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders of the movement said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included on the list of show business figures, producers and media magnate invited to visit Pope Francis to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and had a meeting with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards first champion
Professional climbing and waitress assistant Isaac Caldiero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of $ 1 million.
At this sporting show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two participants - Caldero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the task first and settled at the specified time, becoming the first athlete in the entire history of "American Ninja Warrior", passing through the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero managed to cope with the task three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After winning, Caldiero, who was shocked to have won a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"Thinking about this is incredible, I have never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! a serious leap in his income.
And suddenly... I never even imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Widde met with journalists at The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who first crossed the track, won’t get any cash prize.
According to the rules, the quickest participant gets the money.
"If there are more than one finishing players, the prize is given to the fastest of them," said Wid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still receives tremendous satisfaction.
I don’t think he feels offended about that.
He is happy with what he has done.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He is a wonderful man and family.
He is a hero for his wife and children.
Jeff told me, “If I was destined to lose somebody, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will start shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers quietly bypass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now occupies the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Pretending only to be an obstacle, the Tigers brilliantly won on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with a result of 5-4 on the Target Field.
Twins missed a chance to reduce half-game backwardness from Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which escaped from them for most of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they get,” said Tiger’s manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon contributed to supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit gaining three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
This was only his third qualitative start in nine outings.
“I just want to end the year with good results,” Simon said.
The pitchers are not able to drop in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
The designated rebounding "Tiger" Victor Martinez managed to repel three strikes and achieved two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since the four strikes in the game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He did a good job by beating,” Osmus said.
He showed himself well in (better quality), markedly better in the beat work and retained this quality for the game.
Having scored three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to return to the game.
Central host Byron Buxton opened the inning with a dungeon along the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a band, took the first base, and second baseball player Brian Dozier got a strike-out from Simon before his place was taken by leftist Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moer, the only player on the way, before the newly appointed shutter Miguel Sano, who beat the two-charged "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of raners not in the out and a comparative wound on the second base, Verhaegen managed to bring the third baseball player Trevor Pluff to the double-play.
It was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Plouff knocked out a double-play ball.
After Detroit added a sub-insurance injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moore earned the RBI a "double" into the space between the outfields against the closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth sew.
Detroit took advantage of temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against the well-deserved pitcher, who was on the list of injured before the game, absent for more than a month due to lining inflammation.
“It’s definitely not the start I’d like,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to perform a few pretty good throws in the third inning.”
After the first beat reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to the second bassist, Ian Kinsler.
Woking at two outs by J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first injury in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 to 21" with the runners in the resulting position.
Third base player Nick Castellianos subsequently made a single, bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten out in an attempt to approach third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the count in the second inning, receiving a single-auto "double" from the catcher James McCann and a two-hour "single" of the central defeat Anthony Goose, and the result was 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn’t beat very well, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, whose throwings were considered, threw in the non-pointed third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-handed relief by A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three wounds on six hits and a wok with four strikes.
NOTES: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anibal Sanchez was removed from the players due to a stretching of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had Sanchez undergone a shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, is scheduled to go out in the start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the pitcher-left Daniel Norris will leave the traumatized list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who has left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's pitcher-left on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to a stretching muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov’s original complaint on the book “Prayer to God” was submitted to the South Sakhalin Court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhraj.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the trial.
Chukhraj refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such nonsense,” he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the judge Natalia Perchenko’s decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The Prosecutor’s Office of South Sakhalinsk received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Qur’an.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chuhraj said.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were quoted from the Qur'an - "We worship You and we ask You for help", "Do not invoke anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "shatans and provocators."
He urged the deputies of the State Duma to legally prohibit judicial decisions concerning texts of sacred writings.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law that prohibits the taking of judicial decisions directly concerning the texts of the Qur'an and other Divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram account.
Facebook to Remove Comments Offending Migrants and Refugees
Facebook officials are planning to remove posts and comments that give a negative rating to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the management of Facebook intends to jointly with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, on the eve of the head of the Ministry of Justice Haiko Maas said that at the moment the Ministry of Justice together with social network specialists is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to track and remove incorrect comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
To facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content should also organizations, whose specialists are engaged in the collection of incoming from users of the social network complaints on offensive posts.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements addressing migrants and refugees by the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was made after xenophobic sentiment sharply increased in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which hit the countries of the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, all the places to accommodate refugees are already overcrowded.
On the eve, the authorities of the country decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks in which prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
Moscow cemeteries will have relaxation zones.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Butovskaya, Domodedovskaya, and Shcherbinskaya cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at Troekurovsk Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will also appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation zones will be small green areas, resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "angles" visitors to cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovsk, Butovsk and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest masses as much as possible.
The green plantations will serve as a living fence, which will separate recreational areas and areas dedicated directly to places for burial.
Experts of GBU "Ritual" also stated their intention to submit a proposal on the refusal of fence on burials.
New cemeteries can really become barrierless.
In addition, the "Ritual" told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to know GPS coordinates and number marks of burials.
In June of this year, "Ritual" also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging the tomb in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in the winter, when the earth is frozen.
In the past year, prices for all types of ritual services increased by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a missing mushroom was found in the woods of Elnin.
The elderly man was found alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without supplies.
It was found thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old retired man from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers and volunteers.
There were even filmologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter joined the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods for hats and shovels, but did not return to the evening.
Relatives immediately sought help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people - were raised to search for the fungus.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, a man was found."
He went very far, in a completely different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He walked a great distance at his age.
It miraculously remained alive.
He was taken to the Helsinki Central District Hospital unconscious, in extremely severe condition.
The doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How the elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors absolutely do not imagine.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Helsinki CRD: "A patient's examination, treatment is assigned."
Infusion therapy and antibacterial.
With all its chronic diseases.
The condition of the patient in the morning improved, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to harvest mushrooms before, but never went deep into the forest.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is near the road, itself is not in principle local."
For several years, he went to visit his relatives.
I went after the mushrooms.
He went far and lost.
With the beginning of the fungal season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
There have been five similar cases in the last few days.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, flashbacks and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces in order to be able to return later.
An-2 crashed in the brotherly taiga.
Right in the middle of the village in Siberia an emergency An-2.
An emergency landing was made by the aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane was severely damaged when it landed.
An-2 was on a flight.
On board were three crew members - the commander, the second pilot and the board mechanic, reports "Interfax".
The emergency aircraft was flying on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsk-Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the aircraft has already been transported to Bratislava.
The Brother Transport Prosecutor's Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began to check compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigative team of the Eastern Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed its aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at the abandoned Tajik airport in Komi.
Engine and electronics failed on board, but the crew did the impossible.
On board were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in the emergency landing.
Economics – Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the income gap in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
by Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says the chief researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Selection of Solutions at VSE, Nobel Prize winner in economics 2007 Eric Muskin.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between the two countries are becoming more open.
Supporters of globalization forecast great benefits for emerging economies.
“And these predictions in many ways have come true,” Maskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have seen significant GDP growth per capita.
However, not everything is so rainy.
Globalization was expected to cut the gap between the “wealthy” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is reflected in large inequalities in incomes and, more precisely, in wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the WSE.
Together with Harvard University economist and professor Michael Kremer, Eric Muskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries increases as globalization grows.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin distinguishes four levels of professional qualification - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have increased wages through cooperation with B-level employees from rich countries, then D-level workers do not feel growth or their wages fall at all.
The ultimate effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to the increase of the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in the poor countries and, accordingly, increase the level of inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskarov, professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions, head of the Department of Mathematics at VSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to an upsurge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have funds for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In this situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for the halt of the process of globalization, which has brought and brings its fruits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: A living connection of time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The festival includes the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a trade fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of open temples, the historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of the Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all of this seemed to have come down from the pages of "Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantine, Khazarian Kaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern platans, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is several centuries.
The trees are protected by the All-Russian program “Trees – Monuments of Living Nature”.
The shadow of the scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will be poured aromatic tea and will be served with Dagestan delicacies - honey injection, harem, mushmoula, miracle cupcakes, airan and sweets.
In Derbent for centuries, large samovars have been used to drink tea to numerous guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says the building was built in the year 115 of the Hijra.
This is the year 733 of the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is stunning in scale and solemnity: the arcades of the domes and curves rely on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
Holding and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of birds place pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, on the lofts.
A breathtaking spectacle is the rise into the sky of a bunch of white pigeons, similar to flashes of a festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure closed the port of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven back in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - palaces made of wool, cotton or cotton of all colors and shades, with ornaments and without them, with a sophisticated ornament and a strange edge.
The construction of the city began with magals - quarters with single-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the mags have hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city are preserved parts of the water pipeline, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
To our days have reached ancient springs, from which the locals still collect water today.
Many derbents prefer ordinary water from cranes water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of the cane craft.
Water and drawing vases, dishes, pots, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the carpenters and now make wonderful ceramic products of both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a stretched rope on which students of the Republican School of Circus art perform.
The history of surprising and risky craft has several centuries.
A new trend is that girls can be seen more and more among rover riders.
In the room of the former Girl Bath now operates the museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here accompanied by girlfriends, and now anyone can see the swimming pool, hot and cold swimming pools, bathing accessories.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and steams are now as popular as they were in the past.
The benefits of heating the body with steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body gains flexibility and ease.
The "Community" festival, which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethnic groups of many regions of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and serve visitors with delicious home cheese.
Kirchlar is the cemetery of forty martyrs who took their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
Yellowed from time, the sarcophages are carved out of whole stone blocks and oriented, as is customary in the Arabs, on the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser has been there for many years.
The techniques of circular crafts are passed from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Jacob Brothers can make not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town preserved the house, in which lived deported to the Caucasus writer-decabrist Alexander Bestuchev-Marlinsky.
Having learned Turkic language and gathered ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, the life and life of the citizens.
Chaykhana is a traditional club in the East where only tea and homemade bakeries are served.
Men come here to quench thirst, talk to friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of the chaykhana.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already been able to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The singers of the ensemble rehearsal every day, teaching in perfection the folk Avar, Dargin, Tatsk, Armenian dances.
As the evening begins, when the noise diminishes and the street lights are lit, locals sit down on the benches near the houses with rising terraces.
As a rule, derbents discuss domestic issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall the episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.
In Domodedovo, a business "game to the airport" took place.
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves in the role of airport staff.
For this in Domodedovo mounted models of three airfields.
Young people not only examined and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All this - in the form of a business game, but in complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Delayed flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the trap lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
The airport is hell.
For the one who settled in the hangar Domodedov - a standard set of tasks that newcomers have to solve.
In one hangar fit three major airports from different countries of the world.
They currently employ four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inner world of the airport.
Passenger registration, aircraft service, baggage circulation - they were even trusted by buses on the flight field, traps and passenger inspection.
Passengers are also problematic.
One had trouble with documents, the other was late on the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And to deal with all this is necessary, as in life - in a minimum of time.
For each of these tasks performed, they are charged a certain amount of virtual money, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
"For failure to perform the relevant tasks, they are fined," explained in an interview with the program "Vesti-Moscow" financial analyst of the game Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in essence, new models of activity of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment", - says the Director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Science of Russia Natalia Zolotarjeva.
Students are not on global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
But the results of this exam were quite material.
The latest smart glasses, the best I’ve ever seen!
"I got them for being able to respond to the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner," said Sergey Shuvalov, a player in the game and team manager at Frankfurt Airport.
The best judges, so-called, were taken on a pencil to be invited to work at the time of completion of studies.
The US embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia expressed its regret over the closure of the U.S. Library of Foreign Literature.
The center has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the U.S. Embassy Center at the All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently question the Russian government’s commitment to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of our relations,” U.S. Ambassador John Teft said in a statement.
The American Center established deep and strong ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50 thousand Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Teft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project – the educational exchange program FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Court was quick to execute.
A typical situation: four officials stand before the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
You are not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page command, so that you might have fun with it,” said Kumar.
If one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal, a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has handled more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: in the short 60 years since the proclamation of independence of increased industrial development, India has turned from a country of virgin jungle to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is acute in large metropolis, where the development of infrastructure does not follow the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and a few remaining residential masses are cut under construction by new residential neighborhoods.
Despite formal state support for the Green Movement, the NGO is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, the environment minister called the court’s rulings “extreme” and “impossible”.
Sometimes the court’s rulings are indeed impossible to execute within the court’s deadline, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjvani.
However, inexhaustible deadlines have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
“His main goal is to shake this system,” adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled large-scale construction projects, including the cessation of the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people also try not to forget: for example, during discussions about the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to a single scratch of a judge’s pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years of age from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered from the Delhi government statistics on incoming and outgoing motor vehicles, and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, prior to knowing from the factories whether they are able to fulfill such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court’s focus, the people’s anger began to slow down.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the program to clean up the Ganges River, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and moves to scream.
Do you know what the word “holy” means?
Someone poured water out of the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, the judge burns.
You continue to pollute the river because you think the Gang is the Gang, it will take away all our sins.
It is the river we worship, and look at what you do with it every day.
The Ganga Cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Each year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindu swimmers die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Gang Rescue Foundation money earned from the sale of his costume in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the costume was bought for $ 700 thousand, while cleaning the river required at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Court agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury,” says Malika Bhanot, an activist for the Call of the Gang.
And the court tries to find the golden middle between ecology and development.”
A man shed blood on several Dalí's paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke windows in the museum and spoiled the sculpture of Salvador Dali "The Appearance of an Angel".

Xi Jinping calls for economy to be more open to the world
The economy needs to become more open to the world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to a group facing the challenge of leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open policy,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
Expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor access to the market, changing border control rules, encouraging public enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital, and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually upgraded through trial programs.
This is an important step because it will give the market a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring legality in the business sphere and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers it gives companies, thereby ensuring that the companies will conduct their own business.
China will allow border regions to embrace new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More spheres will be made available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
Additionally, the procedure for applying for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or green card, will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers and training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yongshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
