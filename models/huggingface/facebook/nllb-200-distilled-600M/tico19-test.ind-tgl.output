How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all chest pains should be handled this way especially at your age
and fever
And your blood pressure and cholesterol also need to be checked
And are you having a fever now?
And do you feel this chest pain right now?
And do you have trouble breathing too?
Can you tell me about any other symptoms you've experienced alongside these symptoms?
And how high was your fever?
And I cough too
And I got a little cough and a little fever
And I feel a heavy chest pain today
And this is the season of allergic rhinitis
And feel chest pains
And I think I'm a little bit of a fever too
And I want you to explain where your chest aches
And they're also feverish
and your diabetes history
And you know what, my chest feels like it's gonna break
And you know what, people always cough up on me
and you feel chest pains
And you say that there's pressure in your chest

If this fails, other EU/EEA healthcare systems will likely face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster to humans.
Similar to its homolog virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research subject.

The virus is very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number 1 and has the potential to be more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established virus sequences isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

As the situation develops so rapidly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak still have to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multi-center study in 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following updated epidemiological overview (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at ages 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50, only a few are under 20, and only 14 are under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spreads in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from gestation to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, in line with the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the corresponding mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large viral subfamily containing a single strand of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The spike (S) membrane glycoprotein binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin-exchange enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA accompanied by the envelope glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein forms vesicles containing virions, which then undergo fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new type beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of over 99.98% among 10 samples that were sequentially sampled; the samples were taken from the location of the outbreak, namely Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.

They discovered that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is composed of dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is evidence for identification and infection with CoV.
B0AT1 may be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and middleman
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans through mosquitoes and camels.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The mediator host that helps the virus cross species barriers to infect humans remains unknown, however, and the route of transmission remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed that snakes be a virus carrier from bats to humans that involves recombinant homologs within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the long-nosed, ant-eating mammal that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine, has the potential to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology to the CoV found in the mill and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the 1% difference spread throughout the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Heb. 3).
The physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.

T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoural immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.

The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
A study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.

Febre is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.

Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a family cluster study and a cluster study caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Conversely, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
80% of patients need ventilation support, however, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and ventilation support was needed for about 14%-20% of patients.

Conversely, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.

The figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not overstate MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
As a result, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster monsters are often found in a single family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.

In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L, and increased levels of aminotransferase aspartate as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.

In severe cases, levels of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, increase and lymphocyte counts decrease progressively.
Torax photo disorder is found in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral convex shadows or ground-glass opasities in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disruptions.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction lower surfactant levels and increase surface pressure thus lowering the lung's ability to develop and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings on thoracic photos are often parallel to the worst disease rates.

However, due to the high levels of false-negative, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.

Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease of use if verified on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors mainly offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been previously used or proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).

Even plasma from recovered patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.

As such, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a thermodified cardiopulmonary short-term technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiration.

Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Citokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T cell-directed immune responses; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockage; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.

Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single stranded RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Gilead provided the compound to China for a series of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions of this therapy with other medicines used by patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from the healed patients and antibody making
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize molecules unique to pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.

TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
The effect, however, depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combination.
Today, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 are not yet available, TCM has become one of the leading alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.

Top recovery rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces using TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).

February 18, 2020  Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine therapy (WM) alone with combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it took to recover from body temperature, to lose symptoms, and to be hospitalized was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.

In the early stages of SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which included depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor upheavals, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As such, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people who contact them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Vaccines are essential to break the transmission chain from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and often complement antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus emergence.
Efforts have been made to develop a vaccine based on protein S, which in the long term and effectively creates antibodies to neutralize and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.

Conversely, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.

As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in the age group of 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients over 50 years in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Intensive care patients tend to have absorbent comorbidity and complications and are significantly older than non-intensive care patients (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests age as a prognostic factor for the end result of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.

In addition, elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) may also help predict the end result.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Clinical key symptoms: Thoracic photos and temporal clinical symptom development should be considered alongside other factors to predict the end results and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used as supportive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered from extreme stress as they had to go through long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Long-term psychological counseling and support should be provided to help the patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.

As a result, in the initial phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As such, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Although these actions have caused considerable damage to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates state that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.

Nevertheless, promising signs are showing up in China, seen from the decline in the number of new cases, which suggests that the current strategy may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half as many deaths.

SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be transmitted through direct contact with material contaminated with the virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Recent studies in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial numbers 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep splashes of potentially infected people from trapping air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the splashes can be passed on to others.
Nothing can be done to prevent the inhalation of virions. However, only N95 masks (series numbers 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation of as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
As particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers who contact the patient directly must wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also infect a person through the eyes.


For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.

COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.

Although 96% of genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we still have not been able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What kind of animal is the intermediate species for transmitting viruses from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively disrupt the transmission and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origins suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and result in further pathological changes?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
Over thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) turned things around and revealed how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.

The corona virus (CoV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of veiled, positively-induced, and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoVs", because of its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar layouts.

Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a thong or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complement proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genera, the beta-CoVs have the most HCoVs and are further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Filogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the primary reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
Over the course of thousands of years, CoVs have continually crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.

Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as fever and/or diarrhea.

In fact, it has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until SARS outbreak occurs.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting over 8,000 people with a rough mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 (2019-nCoV) new HCoV, which is further referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
Alarm is sounding and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins in bats, rats, or pets.

Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage were also observed in SARS patients.

In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weak immunity.
Virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of zero patient relatives who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.

HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7-month-old children from the Netherlands in late 2004.

HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
The four HCoVs of this community have all adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases.
Generally speaking, when the ability to move efficiently and maintain itself in humans is gained, the virulence and pathogenicity of this HCoV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.

In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been the surviving species of the prehistoric HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that suffer from severe HCoV disease have been wiped out.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs must reproduce in humans in sufficient numbers to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations in order to fight against host restriction factors.
As a result, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.

An animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoV if it has a closely related ancestor and shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral viruses usually adapt well and are nonpathogenic in these hosts.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs have entered the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
The intermediate mother can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifier host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCoVs can become infected if they cannot maintain transmission in the intermediate host.
HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural reservoir.

The following seroprevalence studies indicate that these animal sellers have a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The moon mosquito (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
neperto, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been reported since all the mosquitoes in the market were killed.

angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat feces samples was shown to use ACE2 in bats, foxes, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interessanto, the serum of convalescent SARS patients can neutralize WIV1.

Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not hosts of the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Filogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, called peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the virus's gateway.
MERS-CoV's dependent polymerase RNA sequence is phylogenetically closer to its homology in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
As such, bats may not be the direct host of the MERS-CoV reservoir.

A recent study based on metagenomic sequences suggests that a group of small, endangered mammals, known as the trenggillans (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new strain of CoV shares 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.

The two are grouped into two sub-lineages of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.

First, humans, not alpacas, who may be in contact with bats in the shared ecological loop.
Conversely, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpacas cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wildlife.

actually, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses.

First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoV can be considered sed to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per footprint, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to the new host.
CoV has a corrective, eliminative exoribonuclease that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue is known to suppress the replication of CoV through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of mutation of the CoV is about a million times higher than the rate of mutation of its host.

Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, implying a higher rate of adaptation in humans.

Theoretically, there is little chance that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genomes in CoVs provide extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs frequently change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique select-copy mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, strand transitions frequently occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can recombine to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-inang interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interactions with host receptors are another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mosquito SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is thought to have rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD of protein S.

In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptor as a virus entryway.
SARS-CoV-RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, bats, rats, and raccoon dogs, thus enabling the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human and mosquito virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them were located in receptor binding patterns for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the clot protein with the human ACE2 receptor.

The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the affinity of binding of S protein to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed an affinity of binding human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.

There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-thresethylation sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this adaptation of the CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its host host.
In addition to the cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also regulated by other host dependence and restriction factors.
The differences in these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents, can be barriers to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependence factor and break down the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the field of these important virus-canine interactions still have to be identified and characterized.

In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression of major class I histocompatibility complex molecules.

The more pathogenic strain of CoV may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of a protein or new protein feature for host adaptation.

CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
CoV reproduces strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Symptoms are severe mainly due to excessive immune response activation and cytokine storm, with lung damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
Conversely, in carrier without symptoms, the immune response is already independent of the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for determining the linkage of immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibitor with MCC950 may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19.

While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, bat CoVs that share 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2 have been found.
Although mosquitoes and other animals on the market were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.

The study of CoV in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
A large number of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Considering that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and mosquitoes in wet markets, it is possible that the closure of wet markets and the killing of all mosquitoes in them effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the dagger should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several strains of the beta-CoV of the dagger closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to humans through termites and other mammals are yet to be clarified in future research.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
As a result, it is not possible to kill all camels to control MERS, as we did in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Before we can eliminate the virus, new genotypes can emerge and cause outbreaks.
Variety of zoonotic CoVs circulating in the wild.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of wild animal feeding in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and control plans must be implemented.

Virus
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if humans are guided to avoid wildlife.
Continued surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep a distance from the natural ecological catchment of zoonotic virus reservoirs.

Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans communicate with bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that is actually the intermediate host, the way that the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and prawns, should be clarified.
Finally, as many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance should be done.
Whether bats, prawns, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will outline the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.

The modifications are based on ongoing research by researchers to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airway including blood drawings, which increase the availability of various specimens, and support the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.

therefore, the flow charts of Zhou et al. need to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as  low risk.
The scoring system will also need to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.

For the diagnosis of anticipated cases and confirmed cases, we recommend that you follow and follow the latest guidelines in your respective countries.
Our team will also update our guides periodically as a help.

In a press release dated March 8, Coles reported that with the lifting of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "surged sharply" last week, according to one of Woolworths' spokesmen.
Costco store in Canberra also limited the number of packages allowed to two last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local government agency restrictions on truck delivery time made it difficult.
He anticipated an increase in production costs, as long as suppliers tried to meet demand, and less special promotion.

Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at Queensland University of Technology, said in a News.com.au report that the store fills up supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet paper was a large-volume item so that the quantity of supplies was low and, if sold out, left so much empty space on the shelves that the scarcity of items became increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue that if there were a lot of stuff on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and sanitation could be bought and there were a lot of them, panic could be minimized, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap recycled toilet paper manufacturer said last Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed that they worked 24/7 to keep supplies, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first auctioneer in Melbourne, while fewer auctions are being held as buyers take a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet cloths.
Stores actually refuse to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3, they say they have no plans to impose purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, handwashing soap, and flour.

We are very alert both to the alarming rate of spread and severity and to the alarming rate of slow action.
Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the pandemic "has never happened before".
In a February report published by CNN, he said, "except for influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "at the core, the outbreak will get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.

The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World-Dangering Public Health Disorder on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.

Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.

Primarily symptomatic and supportive therapy, recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth closing when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected people.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, nighttime hours, workplace hazard control, and closure of facilities.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.

The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is related to bat coronavirus, shingles coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have become ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be associated with the market.

There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.

As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be higher than the reported cases.

A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number is likely to be 5.7.
️Most of the COVID-19 patients are healed.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures may not include people who die without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculation by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual numbers", a statement reinforced by non-scientific reports of overly low deaths in the U.S. Overly low deaths often appear in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, over a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy respectively.

The number varies by region and over time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In China, the estimated death rate for cases decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom persistence from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom persistence after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include case fatality figures (CFR), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a particular disease, and infection fatality figures (IFR), which reflect the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a particular disease.

A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates the overall infection fatality rate for the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate range is in line with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzed the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end of the epidemic are not clear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University observes: "Without any control, infectious outbreaks usually slow down and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of hosts.
"However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time of when that will happen".

March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, likely for one or two years".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraints and other measures will be needed "until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that the coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, could disappear altogether" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The repeat virulence will depend on the group's immunity and the rate of mutation.

The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
Incubation period (time between infection and symptom duration) is usually between 1 and 14 days, usually 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lose their sense of smell initially was 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered cough can cause a droplet to drop 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).

Spread can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus may spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
People give positive test results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Few asymptomatic case reports have been laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.

Virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately made via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or bypass CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
Testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are generally available in a matter of hours to days.

As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have been proven accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of computed tomography (CT) and radiography imaging in people who are symptomatic include asymmetrical opacity of the peripheral ground glass and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to consider it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolving neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies for preventing the spread of the disease include maintaining a thoroughly good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing a towel when coughing or sneezing and throwing the towel away immediately.

WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of disinfectant exposure for stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 6271%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.27.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there are any suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or childcare facilities, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bent elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, then immediately dispose of the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the expirable droplet that spreads when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear a mask.
"Masks are also recommended for people caring for others who may have the disease".
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people treating COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their face.

The strategy in epidemic control is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of disease, further efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and the public.
A combination of containment and mitigation actions can be performed simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of overuse in healthcare and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to address the epidemic include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and cancelling mass meeting events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental-level measures, such as surface cleaning.

South Korea introduced mass screening and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who self-quarantine and imposes large fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished medical inventory accumulation. Simulation for the UK and US showed that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) posed major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for healthcare by up to 2/3 and death by up to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression can be optional, but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is the first one achieved), because otherwise, transmission will bounce back quickly as the measures of suppression are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has impacts on social and economic.

WHO also states that some "traditional and home treatments" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO regional office Europe have issued guidelines for primary health hospitals and services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).

Testing is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
Tests are used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have already been infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or those who have no symptoms.
The exact disease mortality rate and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from these test results.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on virus prevalence in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a huge variation in the number of tests that countries had done.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests on throat exhaustion can only be relied upon in the first week of illness.

Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from the inner airway using a catheter or material excreted through the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and constituted at least 250,000 test instruments to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The device searches for the "E" gene that all coronavirus beta have, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection devices.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests on the old version of the test tool yielded unconvincing results due to reagent error, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that state and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.

As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Equally, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There are no announced quantity limits; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with the CDC's requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.

On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved testing that uses non-PCR isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
Since it does not require a series of temperature shifts, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.

A review of the library published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic images have little diagnostic value in the early stages, since CT [computed tomography] findings may have existed before the onset of symptoms".
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass oscillations with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the current pandemic onset point showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19". In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.

It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
High-resulting automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although a series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, one peripheral blood sample obtained by skin injection is generally used.

Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody testing instruments it had purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme to allow suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube", they spit in it, sent it back, and get test results a short time later. NHS UK announced that the NHS was pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they come to the hospital or having to disinfect an ambulance if used. In the laboratory testing for suspected COVID-19 cases, a health professional would take samples using appropriate precautions.

Wuhan Laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily testing capacity was 50,000 tests per day.The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using just 93 tests.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers have sought to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more coronavirus tests per capita than any other country, and was ready to scale up testing to reach most of the population.

Conversely, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

In the United States, the test equipment developed by the CDC was "flawed"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barrier that prevented private testing.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to use the test equipment correctly.

Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test equipment be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test equipment purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they were not "using it".The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test equipment from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test equipment could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of people tested positive and tracking of people in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, yielded a positive final result.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.

With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than in other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holidays on March 23.

A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatalities, possibly because these countries were more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "% test positive" is influenced by the country's testing policy.

Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hands in order to remove dirt, oils, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap at specific "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, that are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also get respiratory illnesses, such as influenza or smallpox, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after urination, after cleaning your ass or changing diapers, before feeding your child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.

Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.

Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as unconscious behaviors are practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of death in toddlers; the disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.

Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Washing hands also protects oneself from impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage from drying.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Prolonged hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (drinking, urinating), after cleaning a child's ass (replacing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.

A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China was at the lowest rate at 23 percent. Now there are some behavioral change methodologies available to improve adoption of hand washing habits with soap at critical times.

The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solvent and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic dirt, are not readily soluble in water.

Solid soap, because of its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies examining the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely to occur because the bacteria are soaked in foam.
Nevertheless, the CDC maintains that "liquid soap that is removed from containers without touching the hand is preferred".
Antibacterial soap is widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant strains.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains aren't targeted by antibacterial soap, it may not be as effective as the soap marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (croat tongue, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that ordinary soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand sanitizer agents in the form of water-based alcohol wipers (also called alcohol-based hand wipers, antiseptic hand wipers, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these alcohol- or ethanol-based isopropyl hygiene agents are formulated together with a thickener such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or with a humektan such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effects of alcohol.

The increasing use of sanitizers is due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, sanitizers should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are available.

The drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, emollient-based hand sanitization caused much less skin irritation and dryness than soap and antimicrobial detergent.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand wipes are rare.

Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, if it comes into contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with running hot or cold water.
️ Water flow is recommended because the boiling basin may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature does not seem to affect.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, the fingertips, and under your nails.
Sopos remove germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with water alone.

Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap and/or soap water is not available, for example, draining water from a hose or bottle that is suspended and piped and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-taps", as well as other low-cost options.
Tipy taps are simple technologies that use water bottles that are suspended by ropes, levers that are operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of hand hygiene processes, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
Research has shown that paper towels are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels of paper lap, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in fingerbooks and 254% in palms.
Drying with jet air dryer causes an average increase in total bacterial counts of 42% in fingerbooks and 15% in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper clip, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in fingerbooks and 77% in palms.
Jet air dryers, which blow air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), are capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment to a depth of up to 2 meters.

The paper was not showing a significant spread of microorganisms.
After hand drying, changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper drying.
Washing hands using hand sanitizer is an alternative during the trip if there is no soap and water.

Medical handwashing was mandated long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or a gel to rub and rub each hand.
Hands should be rubbed with fingers tied together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water in the hands, hands need to be thoroughly washed and dried with clean cloth.

The purpose of hand washing in health care is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("dandruff") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine  reports that the lack of hand washing is still unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that washing hands properly and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent.
WHO's Hand Sanitation Concept Guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.

The killing function may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To 'squeeze' the hands before surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching is required, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile lap to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean the bottom of the nail.
All the jewelry must be removed.

The encouragement and encouragement of soap-washing can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term population behavior change.

A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can move from one star to ultimately three stars.
Construction of handwashing facilities can be part of a handwashing campaign that is being conducted to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to raise awareness that tries to achieve the goal of behavior change. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promotes the use of handwashing emoji.
A number of studies have examined the effectiveness of the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoiding Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALY) or the size of years lost to illness.
One review showed that promoting handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing to human health, especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "founder of modern nursing" in England.

In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne and health-care-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, posters "the right hand washing technique" are hung next to hand washers in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.

The phrase comes from a Bible chapter in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands continually to clear her imaginary stains; an act that showed her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The religion commands hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a part of hand washing rituals in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netila yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands after using a toilet.

Control of workplace hazards for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodology to hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard control depends on the workplace and work tasks, which are based on assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers; for this job, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Workplace at risk of exposure includes work that requires close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to an ongoing community outbreak or international travel.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Control of hazards for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection when encountering COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers health workers and morgue workers exposed to people known or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers undergo aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle specimens from, people known or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard control for this worker includes technical controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and self-protection equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact in the workplace.

Eventually, shipments from geographically heavily affected areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Precautions and infectious disease control plans can be used to guide protective measures.
Plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community order, as well as individual risk factors for workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls needed to address these risks and the emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and control plans for communicable diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the epidemic control include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the communities where the business is located affects the response taken.
The hierarchy of hazard control is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls based on their effectiveness.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Technical controls include insulating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in employment policy or procedure that requires action by a worker or employer.
Self-protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and correctly worn, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezings, providing nets and trash cans, preparing work remotely or shift work with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever reducing medications or other symptom-modifying medications, and that sick leave policies be flexible so that employees can stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, work at risk of exposure includes work that requires close contact or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to contagion in the community around the business location, or because someone has recently travelled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.

Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If someone falls ill on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a cabin crew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouths and noses with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear medical gloves once-in-a-lifetime when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly other protective devices if sick passengers experience fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in life-threatening bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if ill, self-isolation, and informing the onboard medical center immediately if someone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabin of the person who is isolated. Despite the spread in the community, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the person who is infected has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in the community at a minimal to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.

If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their belts and duty equipment before re-use using a household cleaner spray or lap and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APDs as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and mortuaries to be in the high or very high exposure risk category.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transportation personnel who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Workplace exposure is very high if workers perform aerosol production procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk mortuary work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high risk of exposure if workers perform autopsies.

WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves for people who take breathing specimens, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures.
If aerosol extraction procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
WHO recommends minimizing the need for APDs through remote medical services, physical limitations such as window of opportunity, with only those involved in direct treatment allowed to enter rooms containing COVID-19 patients, using only APDs needed for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization going through this time.
We are eager to relieve the pressure and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to cut down on your work schedule, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:

Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.

There's some work to be done.
SRE, HR, Trust & Security Operations, and Fundraising teams, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We'll begin a process with all departments to assess our current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what's essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't do anything for the future.
️We don't plan to "overtime work chasing after" after the pandemic passes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We realize that the situation is changing and will try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
How about the APP?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
The extension of this timeline greatly reduces the workload and planning stresses currently present throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you app team for your leadership in this matter.

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metalol-enzym that is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 has a terminal-N peptidase M2 domain and a terminal-C renal amino acid collectrin transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resultant dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II lung alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.

ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II by vasoconscription.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the S1 protein to the spike or thongs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endositosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosomes located within the cell.
The virus's entry process also requires priming of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host protease serine, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.

A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
"Advanced use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.

Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipoplysaccharide-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
RHACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours in humans with a duration of 30 minutes plus the duration of the effect of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased blood circulation of angiotensin II.
"COVID-19 Application" is a mobile software application designed to assist in contact tracking to combat the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.

Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentions a number of practical problems that may arise in application-based systems, which include false positives and the possibility of ineffectiveness if the data taken by applications is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, namely restricting only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Advocates of privacy have expressed their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly regarding whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be discontinued once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization states eight conditions for government projects:
the supervisor must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the extension of monitoring and surveillance must have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be restricted to COVID-19 purposes;

There is a possibility that a vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates the need for containment measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in dealing with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine or vaccine to protect against SARS that is proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts support conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been made available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and organ failure.

In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Inkumbiacy period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The National Health Commission of China began to include symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral loads on a large scale.
Talk aloud releases more splashes or drops than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause a droplet to be pushed up to 15 feet [4.5 m].
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in corridors outside people's rooms produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn the respiratory secretion into an aerosol and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus may spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that viruses can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Sapone and detergent are also effective when used correctly; soap products break down the virus-protective fat layer, deactivate the virus, and free it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, were less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.

The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury is found in 12% of infected people treated in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illnesses.
High rates of cardiovascular symptoms due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells have been shown to correlate with monosit recruitment secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing is usually performed on breathing samples obtained through nasopharynx; however, nasal or sputum samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart so that the results have a small time value.

mild pneumonia: edema pulmonary, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and formation of multi-core giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Blood: diseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
CDC recommends the use of face masks from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large-scale meetings in public places.
The restrictive guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.

CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands look dirty, before eating, and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance "is not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humektan.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear simple face masks.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self-hygiene and lifestyle as well as healthy diets are recommended to boost immunity.

For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend more parasetamol (acetaminophen) than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers who are treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.
Recommended equipment are: APD cloak, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves.

A ventilator capable of performing high pressure control mode and PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pneumothorax-related lung injury.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some drugs under test have already been approved for other uses or are already undergoing further testing.
Antivirus can be tried on people with severe illnesses.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in potential efficacy and safety trials. FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is very or immediately at risk.
Plasma convalescent has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove its safety and efficacy for the disease.

Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.

In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or complex organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.

In one study that looked at early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, males had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while females had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
The histological examination of a postmortem lung sample showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycosid exudate in both lungs.
The cytopatic changes in the virus are observed in the pneumocytes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people have congenital conditions.
The mortality estimates of the condition vary due to the differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of light counting can cause deaths to be counted too high.
The fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is too low.

Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from illness, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This can also lead to post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.

According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.

Although not everyone who is infected produces antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have died.

In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and new women not apparent at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.

International research into COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.

Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous SARS-CoV studies were used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.

Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method remains controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chlorokuin.
The newly-targeted antiviral drug constitutes the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting deadline of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is already in place. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence for remdesivir's success.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China, and Italy.Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.

Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.
The study of chlorokuin and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin had significant limitations which have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in severe advanced COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antitoxin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
