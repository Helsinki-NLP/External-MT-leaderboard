Members of the Welsh Assembly were worried about being seen as scumbags.
There are fears among some MPs about the proposed name change to MWPs.
This proposal arose from a change in plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that he might become a laughingstock in the political arena.
One assembly worker said his group was nervous because the name is a portmanteau of Twp and Pwp-.
For readers outside Wales: twp is crazy in Welsh and pwp is crazy.
A member of the Assembly Party for Wales (Plaid Cymru) says the group is unhappy and has offered alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative says his group is biased about the name change, but notes that the conversion of Welsh MPs to crooks was a short leap of the tongue.
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing to introduce legislation on the renaming, said: "The final decision on any characterization of the names of the members of the Assembly should of course be the members' decision".
The Welsh Government gave the Assembly for Wales the power to change its name by an Act of 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, which received strong support for the name of the assembly, the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission supported the Welsh Members of Parliament, or WMPs, on the naming of the Assembly (AMs), but the MWP received the most support from the peer consultation.
Apparently, the House is offering alternatives, but the struggle to reach agreement could be a headache for the incumbent, Ellen Jones, who will likely present a bill for the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on legislative amendments will also include other changes to the working style of the Assembly, including the rules for disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have a final vote on what they're called when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians launch referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was supposed to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own state called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory, and has applied repeatedly to the EU and NATO for membership.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would cancel the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the renaming is just a fee to join the EU and NATO.
As tensions between the churches in Harlem began to rise, the bells of St. Martin's were silenced
"The adults I've spoken to say that historically, there was a cafe and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
None of them exist today.
He said that the disappearance of the cafes was understandable.
"People communicate in different ways now", he said.
Cafes are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he's worried that the revenue from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
"The churches", he added, "can be replaced by convent buildings filled with people who don't help the shrines in their neighborhood".
"The vast majority of people who buy into these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who move into these buildings will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregants before the Metropolitan Community became the black capital of Harlem in 1870, and St. Martin's was built a decade later.
In 1930, the real white Methodist conference was pulled out.
The black congregation, which worshipped in the neighborhood, became the name of the building.
St. Martin was seized by the Black Congregants led by St. John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of the retail boycott of 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, and was against hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire caused extensive damage to the building, but as Father Johnson's clerks planned to rebuild it, they were commissioned to acquire the bells.
St. David Jones, the son of Father Johnson and the rector of St. Martin's Church, proudly calls the bells the bells of the poor.
The expert who rang the bells in July called them cultural treasures and irreplaceable historical tools.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who replaced the bell with a larger one at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that Mr. Martin had not replaced him.
What's happened around St. Martin's over the last few months has been a tangled story between architects and planners, some brought in by church leaders, some by the Episcopal theme.
The Assembly of Elders, the church's governing body, wrote in July, concerned about the issue of avoiding costs, despite the fact that the Assembly was not involved in the process of hiring architects and planners.
Some churchgoers complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the theme.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California when he dived to catch a pirate
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, the opening day of the California pirate season, according to a statement.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near the Bacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. He and the group headed to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a pirate, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I got bit".
- I was bitten.
"His arm was completely broken", said Hamel, "and he didn't notice it until he got to the boy".
"I'm yelling at everyone to get out of the water", Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was assessed in critical condition.
The type of shark was unknown.
At a press conference, rescue captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been in the area for a few weeks, but it was not considered an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the spine.
Officials have closed the entrance to the Athens coast from Casablanca Ponto to Swami for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles added that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's designs are introduced to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is involved in the beauty of the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams department stores, along with professional assistants.
As part of a significant £2.8 billion investment in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home goods sales are in decline, the big beauty salons will be piloted in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, more stores will be relocated next year.
The beauty investment came about when supermarkets started looking for ways to make space for TVs, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double in size, offering up to 3,000 beauty products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more branded space, like at Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup line, so that most of the products are plant-based, which is a growing demand among younger shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other last year at Sale Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping, and the shift to daily shopping at local convenience stores for small amounts of food, means that supermarkets have a lot to do to get people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Cope said retail outlets would be seen as a one-stop shop as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and no groceries.
Sainsbury's installed Argos retail outlets in hundreds of stores, and introduced a number of Habitats brands, until two years ago when it bought both chains, which, in his own words, boosted grocery sales and made his acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried to form a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended in a dispute over how to split the proceeds from their supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy was created after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyd was expected to play a major role in this scheme by adding four stores to the luxury skin care range, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Says Paul Mills-Hick, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, "We've transformed the look of our beauty salons and brought a different flavor to the table, enhancing the aesthetics for our customers.
We also invested and trained special partners who would be able to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we're now a glamorous beauty center that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is bankrupt after an £11 million deal with Holly Wilba
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was left in the lurch when TV presenter Holly Wilby walked away from her lifestyle business for £11 million to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Wilby didn't have time to deal with Truly, the brand of home furnishings and accessories.
The couples business became akin to Gwyneth Peltro's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Wilby left the lucrative lifestyle business with Dragon's Den star Peter Jones at the last minute to focus on her new, extensive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "upset" when the TV golden girl announced her new deal of £1.5million and more at their business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, meaning she no longer had enough time to market their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was modelled on Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand and aimed to double Wilba's £11 million in the future.
When 37-year-old Wilby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK and headed to one of his summer cottages.
The source reports: "Truly was the pinnacle of Holly's priorities.
That's going to be his long-term future, which will ensure that we see him for the next few decades.
His decision to leave was obviously a shock to everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe's headquarters full of goods ready for sale.
Experts are confident that the This Morning host, who is considered one of Britain's richest stars, will cost the company millions in products ranging from blankets and candles to massive investments in clothing and home furnishings, as well as delays in its subsequent launch.
And that could be the end of a long-term relationship.
The mother of three of the Wilbains and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about ten years.
Wilby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became president in March.
The couple are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Wilby was to become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Annette McPartley as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, someone close to Jones said, "We're not going to comment on any business matters".
After a difficult conversation, we fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism he's going to get from the press for a comment that many would consider unpresidential and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said in his typical mocking news anchor voice, "I'm not going to lie to you.
- I didn't give anything away.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, when Trump considered denuclearization of North Korea a big step.
But the talks on denuclearization were suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see an "adequate" US response to the North Korean disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the US continues to use sanctions to maintain a targeted tension.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
We have a great relationship with the Huns.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship", she said.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had paid off, ending missile tests, helping to free hostages in the Gulf, and finally bringing American troops home.
And he kept his unusual approach when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded space, we're going to have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds
For example, after the Lompoc earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national epidemic was declared that would be a prerequisite for international humanitarian aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it's pretty clear that they're not going to ask for international assistance, so it's a little bit complicated", said Ms. Sambouge.
While Save the Children is recruiting a team to travel to Palu, they're still not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palo to make sure that international agencies would be allowed to conduct charitable events.
Given that Indonesia is constantly being shaken, yet the country remains unprepared for the elements.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning and even warning in Palo may have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make supplying much more difficult.
An aid ship based in Lamboc, which was providing relief to earthquake victims, headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's fragile infrastructure a priority of his campaign, and he spent money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is a concern for Mr. Yoko's administration, as he is up for re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also has problems with inter-religious tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using guns, arrows, spears and other heavy weapons.
Look, Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has tied the score against Chelsea
At Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League game against Chelsea by a draw.
Sturridge got the ball from Khedran Shakir 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before hitting the goal.
The test hit came a little higher than the gate, because it went through the top right of the gate.
Finally, the ball went down by the bouncing Kepa Arizabaluga and entered the gate.
"I was just trying to get in that position to get the ball, but players like Shaggy always get in as early as possible, so I tried to buy as much time as possible for me", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Canté approaching, I touched the ball a little bit, without thinking about it, and I just hit.
Chelsea were 1-0 up when Belgian star Eden Hazard opened the scoring in the 25th minute.
In that game, before the Blues striker reached the centre of the field and scored from a short distance, he sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth transmission in the center of the field.
Then he hit a perfect goal into the goal, towards the 1000.
Hazard came off the bench and finished the attack at left-back, passing the ball to Liverpool's Alison Baker.
On Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League.
Chelsea are playing against Videotron in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The country's disaster relief agency reported that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832 on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, the agency's press secretary, Sutopo Puruo Nguro, said that many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings after Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which had waves as high as 20 feet.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was found under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing and killing a woman
A murder investigation was launched when the body of a woman was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in the John Street neighborhood of Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people who had seen or heard anything in the area to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would like to urge anyone who witnessed or heard anything suspicious in John Street's Brickenhead to contact us".
I urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on tape, to contact us if they have information that is critical to the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed the identity of the woman whose body was found in her Birkenhead home.
This afternoon, friends who knew the woman arrived at the scene to ask where they found the body in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson, Mass., was trying to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was devastated when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would take hours before they were allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer was telling a man that the whole area was now being watched as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
She kept saying how horrible it was.
At 2 p.m. at noon, two police cars were inside the cordon and another car was outside.
Several policemen were standing inside the cordon, guarding the apartments.
Anyone with any information about the incident should contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crime Prevention Center anonymously on 080055111 with the number 247 as of September 30th.
Cromwell's half-brother in Parliament, rewriting history for debate, becomes the last historic hit.
His expulsion will be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of England's cultural and spiritual artworks by its morbid Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Union described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Union, said: "The discussion of the removal of the statues now outside the Palace of Westminster is inevitably becoming the object of Oliver Cromwell's half-breed.
The ideas of the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor instigated by Cromwell.
Perhaps, in the last century, Cromwell was mistakenly sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas.
Mr. William Hamo Tronicroft's brilliant presentation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century view and historical overview of a character that many still revere.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was respected by many, certainly more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, from monarchy".
Whether or not this is a fully accurate reproduction is still subject to ongoing historical debate.
It is remarkable that the clash of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as a keeper are also worthy of appreciation and remembrance.
The killer pig brutally kills the Chinese farmer
Local Chinese media reports that a farmer in the southwest market was attacked and killed by a pig.
The South China Morning Post reports that a man of the Yuan family was found dead near the Liupanshi Market in Gizhou on Sunday, his throat cut and covered in blood.
A farmer was about to vaccinate a pig in Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he went with his nephew to the neighboring town of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next pig farm open.
He said there was a huge male pig in the pigsty with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the coroner confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's knees were bloody and bruised", said the Wu family name.
Security cameras caught Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The beast that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his nephew.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent any attack until police had gathered evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's management are negotiating compensation for his death.
In the past, there have been rare cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran over a Welsh farmer's tractor, until his wife managed to scare the pig away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs. A farmer in Manitoba told CBC News, "Pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can deter them".
They just like to play.
They're like babies, they're very curious -- they won't hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of attention.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, moving across the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico, Hurricane Rosa is abating.
Anyway, in the coming days, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of 5:00 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, Rosa had a strength of 85 miles, a Category 1 storm, 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tidal wave is forming over the Pacific Ocean, and it's moving from the east coast of the United States to the west coast, as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, bringing humidity from the northern United States to the south.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, interacting with the rainfall, will produce massive downpours in the southwest over the next few days.
On a local scale, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause flooding, rockfall, and possible landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause up to two to three inches of precipitation per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of two to four inches is expected in the southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Flooding is possible in rapidly deteriorating weather conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely bad advice to walk in the desert with the imminent danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canals into rivers, and thunderstorms can bring strong winds and dust.
The approaching flood will cause heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
Half an inch of rain, possibly causing the small rocks to flow and the roads to slide.
This will be the first heavy rainfall in the region this wet season.
Some tropical monsoon rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rains become more common on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Tuesday's heavy rainfall will spread to the four corners and continue until Wednesday.
In the United States, you can see some intense temperature fluctuations in October, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics stay pretty warm.
Sometimes this can cause severe temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a good example of a dramatic temperature change in the central United States.
There's about a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to spread again.
October is expected to have a mild start in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching about 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80°C] from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
New York City's temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there's a good chance that by the first half of October, the eastern United States will be above average.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh auditions
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television sets the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political confrontation continued as broadcasters stopped regular broadcasts at the last minute of Friday, with Arizona Senator Jeff Blake securing a deal that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would conduct a weekly cost audit.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been intoxicated and had tried to pull the trigger at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh enthusiastically testified that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen, it was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that were showing it, the numbers weren't immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting the statistics of people watching from the office.
In this sense, the number of viewers is the same as the number of viewers watching a football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose public opinion guests have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's candidacy, leads all networks with an average of 5.9 million viewers per day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, interest remained high.
In the Friday tragedy, Flake was the centerpiece.
After the Republican office announced it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras were pointed at protesters Friday morning as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing room.
He stood for a few minutes on CNN, his eyes on the ground, because he felt a little bit overwhelmed.
I'm standing right in front of you.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the world?
They said, "You have power, when many women are powerless", said one woman.
Flake said his office had sent out a message and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have much more to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks later made live broadcasts when the Judiciary Committee was to notify the Senate of the vote on Kavanaugh's nomination.
But Flake said he would only do so once he realized that the FBI would be looking into the candidate's allegations next week, which was what the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partly convinced after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with the count and many other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have a vote on Kavanaugh without a confirmation hearing.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister May blames political criticism for Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accuses "political" criticism of her plans to leave the European Union as well as of hitting national interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham, UK, to attend the Conservative Party conference.
On the front page, in another interview with him, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson expressed his displeasure with his so-called Brexit auditors plan, presenting his proposal that Britain and the EU should join forces to be fully prosperous.
Police have arrested Dayton Simpson, suspected of the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, on suspicion of shooting Wade Simms to death.
According to a statement from the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
The video of the confrontation between Simpson and Sims has been officially released, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a CBS statement, police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to his crime.
According to the attorney's statement, his share was $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge District Attorney's Office released a preliminary statement saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern Police University and the residents of the region for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LPA Regional Director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement for their hard work and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was very tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LFC coach Will Wade said the team was "appalled and shocked" by the news of Wade's death.
"That's what keeps you so upset", Wade said.
The volcano has spread gray smoke over Mexico
Smoke from the eruption of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
After a surge in activity at the volcano's crater on Saturday and 183 gas leaks in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The center was monitoring multiple tremors and tremors.
Images posted on social media from the neighboring Mexican city of Ho Chi Minh City show thin layers of smoke covering the car's windshields.
Since the September 2017 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck central Mexico, geologists have detected activity near a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police as thousands joined rival protesters to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists were blown back by the police, who sprayed eggs and dust on them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which constantly bothered tourists.
Later in the day, clashes with the police resumed, and they used police batons to try to put the fight behind them.
Within hours, the independence groups chanting "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" were confronted by the Democratic conservatives who were chanting "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people who suffered minor injuries during the protest were treated.
Tensions in the newly independent region had intensified a year earlier when the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters will vote for independence, although there was a small presence among those who voted against the dissolution and many boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop voting in neighbourhoods.
On Friday night, pro-independence groups came out to stop the demonstration, with the help of the national police.
Progress was being made, but the demonstration had to take a different direction.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer saw any prospects for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stoned", she said.
Despite a narrowly fatal victory in the regional elections in December last year, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia were struggling to keep the momentum going this year, along with their best leaders, who were in jail or in detention as a result of the independence referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest supporting the police on his phone, said the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in the preliminary trial since last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression and repression of popular values seen by the Spanish government", he said.
London: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in London several times.
The incident occurred on Thursday, at 7:30 p.m. local time in Belinagar Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It's possible that the car hit a crossbar and it was partially damaged.
In a match against Rangers, Menga's shot gave Livington a 1-0 victory
Dolly Mangan's first goal secured the win for Livington
Livington's promotion confused Rangers, transferring Steven Gerrard to manage Ibrox, causing their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mangan's shot, it seems, was different for Gary Holt, getting to Hibernian on the second level.
This Premier League season Gerard's side were knocked out of the competition, and the following Sunday they face the leading Hart, who are 8 points behind.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, Rapid Vienna hosted Rangers in the Europa League.
Livingston, who continued his unbeaten run with head coach Holt in six games, was losing until last month when he was replaced by Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed its opportunities in front of a confused audience.
Before the goal was scored, Holt's team should have been in the lead, causing them immediate trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson took the lead, sparing no effort to score, then Alan Lithgone was able to direct all his efforts to the wide, meeting Craig Holcort's headshot.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause inconvenience to the visitors in the designated areas.
And that was the way the deciding goal was scored.
Rangers gave up the free kick and Livingston worked towards opening the score, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson trying to block Mengele, who took the ball and hit the goal from the centre.
At this stage, Rangers were in the lead and their goal defence was unassailable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was invincible.
This style of play was maintained until the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos broke Kelly's safety.
Scott Pittman was kicked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Legg was kicked by another Livingston player.
After two penalties, one of which was the replacement of Holcitt with Glam Middleton, the other for a hand-to-hand match, the cross-attacks at Livingston's goal continued with a continuous push back.
"It was phenomenal".
Alasdair Lamont for the Scottish BBC broadcast from Tony MacCarthy's Arena
An incredible game and score for Livingston.
One person said they were excellent, continuing to exceed their expectations.
Since moving up the ranks, their style of play and the line-up have changed significantly, but it's a big credit to Holt because the team has been revitalized since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett had done a great job of building a strong defense, and in the process, Menga had been watching Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall closely.
However, the inspiration for Rangers was short-lived.
As good as they were playing with Gerard, they still didn't meet the standards.
Their lack of the last ball and their side's one-off miss was a wake-up call for Rangers to get in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue clouds on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at normalizing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed a wide range of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the inauguration of a huge mosque.
This city is home to a large Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have acquired security measures to close the entrance to the 25,000-strong mosque, but many supporters have been able to see their president up close.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him.
The firing protest reflected the inappropriateness of some German Turks in treating the visitor as a hero and vilifying him as a self-proclaimed hero.
A cyclist was killed after a car crashed on Deptford Road
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 local time at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and in the presence of witnesses, the man died at the scene.
The accident happened on Childress Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday accident, about a month after another cyclist died.
Metropolitan police say they are working to identify the man and notify relatives.
The road is closed, and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
The Long Lartine Prison riot injured six officers
According to the prison office, during the trial of a man in a strictly male prison, six officers were injured in the riots.
The riots broke out at Long Lart prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 local time on Sunday and continue to this day.
A specialised team of assassins, the Tornadoes, were brought in to put down the riots, involving eight prisoners from the same wing.
The killers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison said: "Long Lart has been brought to the prison by specially trained prison staff to calm the ongoing incident.
Six crew members were treated.
We cannot tolerate any violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be arrested and spend a long time behind bars.
Long Lart prison has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, correctional officers were called to the jail to put down a major riot, during which the pool staff were attacked with pool bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (spaces may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical cyclone to damage Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Rosa hits the Southwest Desert, potentially causing flooding.
The National Weather Service has already forecast flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to make its way to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday in the evening rains.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, within 200 miles of Phoenix, only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind status.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina was traveling at 40 miles to the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict two to four inches of torrential rain, up to six inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest desert, including the Rocky and the Great Basin, are likely to get one to two inches of water, possibly four inches apart.
For areas that are safe from flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is at risk of drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, these rains are likely to be beneficial to the Southwest, which is currently under threat of drought.
According to a report by the US weather.com website, "More than 40 percent of Arizona is at risk of a major Category III drought as a result of weather monitoring".
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads from the Baja Peninsula in Mexico to the coast.
Rosa on Sunday morning, still in strong force, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The wind is sweeping over the cold waters of the Pacific, and so its power is increasing.
So, we're looking at a landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening, due to the intensification of the tropical winds.
In parts of Mexico, the rains will be torrential, causing severe flooding.
According to weather.com, rainfall is expected to be 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, possibly as high as 10 inches.
Rosa then sweeps north into Mexico as a tropical storm, until it reaches the Arizona border by Tuesday morning, and then late Tuesday night, sweeps through Arizona and reaches southern Utah.
The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the Southwest Desert of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and landslides in the deserts as well as mountain landslides.
Four people arrested for attempted attack in Mitsomer Norton
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
At approximately 0400 hours local time on Saturday, the boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mittsomer North.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was assessed as stable.
Avon and Somerset Police report that two teenagers aged 17 and 18 and a man aged 20 were arrested in the Redstock area that night.
Police are calling on anyone who may have a phone recording of the incident to contact them immediately.
Trump says Kavanaugh has become a victim of the Democratic Party's anger and power
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote against the Democratic Party's reckless and dishonorable tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been a victim of the Democratic Party's anger and power throughout his run for president.
On Thursday, Kavanagh testified before Congress, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's baseless accusation that she sexually assaulted him years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial after hearing his charges.
On Saturday, the president said, "The American people witnessed Kavanaugh's wit, character, and courage that day.
"The vote to elect Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to elect one of the most brilliant and legal thinkers of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant knowledge of public service", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
During the midterm elections, the president alluded to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke about the importance of the Republican convention.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running.
That's why I'm so passionate about good candidates", she said.
Trump insisted that Democrats have a mandate to stand up and be counted.
A spokesperson for the leadership of the Grand Old Party (Republican Party) told CNN that the first general election for Kavanaugh's Senate candidate is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people were affected by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, along with the deterioration of visibility.
Authorities said that at least 384 people were killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, many of them driven to the beaches by the huge waves.
Hundreds of people gathered on one of the beaches in Palu City for the festival on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) wave hit the beach and swept away the bodies of people, destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In a Jakarta news conference, Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for BNPB, an Indonesian disaster mitigation company, said that yesterday, when the tsunami was so alarming, people continued to do their thing on the beach and did not flee, and they became victims.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it brought cars, prisoners, houses, it hit everything on land", said Negrohon, adding that before it hit the shore, the tsunami had been drifting over the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
Some people climbed trees to protect themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
The images released by the organization, which took aerial photos of the ruins, show many destroyed houses and shops, destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued in coastal areas on Saturday.
The tremors were also felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Organization for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.
It is said that the city's geographical position, lying on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have further extended the size of the tsunami.
Negroho said the damage was "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some bodies of victims were found under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Ngroho said the casualties and damage could be greater in the coastal area, 300 kilometers north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
The communications in Donggala were in complete absence of information, said Ngroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that staff and volunteers were being sent to the affected areas.
They say this is a tragedy, but it could have been worse.
On Sunday, the organization was heavily criticized for not keeping abreast of the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had reached the surface before the warning was issued.
In a fan-favorite video that has been leaked online, you can hear a man on the top floor shouting tsunami warnings to people in the street below.
Within minutes, the wall of water hits the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused tremendous power fluctuations, which made communication impossible in the area around Palu, which in turn made it difficult for authorities to send coordinates to rescue forces.
The military has begun sending aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the displaced people are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened to relief forces only, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
While the staff of World Vision in Dongola reached Pallu safely, where the workers are sheltering in mud huts in the courtyard of their offices, they witnessed scenes of destruction on their way, Mr. Doseban said.
They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
That's very bad.
Even as aid groups began the brutal process of installing disaster relief equipment, some complained that foreign aid workers, who were better informed about the situation, were preventing Pallu from traveling.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign funding, aid and staffing can only be started if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered a state-level disaster", said Ouliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we'll be able to get international aid, but we don't have the right to it yet.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palo on Friday, the families and friends of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that were tragically lost in natural disasters.
It was the Sabbath, and a little boy was taken from the manger.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Jendn Subandon, the Indonesian national para-climbing team coach, trained two of the missing para-climbers ahead of the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier that month.
The others at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandaghi the Sick, were his students.
"As a paraglider, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Jenn tells how he, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread through the paraplane community, desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu's rivals attending the beach party.
But his messages only got one gray mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it's a sign that the messages didn't get through", he said.
In Newport Leavey, the thieves stole $26,750 while charging the ATM.
According to news reports from Newport Police, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling out an ATM at Newport Levi's on Friday morning.
The driver was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was about to deliver more money to Detroit, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was doing this, another man followed Brink's employee and stole a bag full of money that was to be delivered.
According to eyewitness accounts, he saw several suspects fleeing, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
People with any information about their identities can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, had been using the nickname Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes on Saturday night during the live broadcast of her new album, Yandy.
"She's replacing Ariana Grande, who was forced to cancel her speech for emotional reasons", said the exhibition organizer.
In addition to being a shortened form of his current name, West has noted that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think  is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means du", West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It spread from Kanyé, which means just Yi, and became a reflection of our good, bad, confusion, everything.
The album is more about who we really are.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddie, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brotherly Love.
JY-ZIN, who had previously worked with West, also wrote his name in capital letters or without them.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
At the Tlatelolco complex on Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force to oppress Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration at the campus, troops opened fire, killing nearly 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were widespread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly stipends to those who study and by establishing more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education create opportunities for young people to become members of a criminal gang.
The United States should double its funding for AI.
"As China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double the amount it spends on research", says Kai-Fu Lin, an investor and AI practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, while the U.S. itself has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan to become the world's leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research is a good start, considering the United States is pretty much ahead of other countries, and we're looking forward to the next step in AI", Lin said.
In an interview this week, Lin told CNBC that doubling the funding could double the next big thing the United States will achieve in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, whose book, The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, has invested in one of China's most profitable AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence program that beat out the highest-rated American actor, Othello. He later became CEO of Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's China division.
Lee took on former U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robot Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next creators.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
"The academic leaders are not being taken by China, but by the corporations", Lin said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired top professionals from universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policies could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should offer a credit card to the AI philosophy doctor right away", he said.
The National Council of China presented its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"The National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Lin said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, designed to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which is seeking to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help resolve a years-long dispute with Greece that has been an obstacle to its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a state called Macedonia, claims that to call its northern neighbor Macedonia means to seize its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov announced that he would not participate in the vote, and boycott campaigners have questioned whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Do you agree to NATO and the European Union membership and accept the post-Greece agreement?"
Supporters of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price of becoming a full member of NATO or the European Union for Macedonia, one of the countries that managed to survive the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, for a prosperous future under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgiakova, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will stay behind the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority vote in the House.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 a.m.
However, voter turnout was 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 election, when 66% of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Gose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko filled their ballots in a referendum to change the name of Macedonia, thus paving the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvardarkov, was setting up a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents that were being set up by people opposed to the referendum.
We're in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to be proud to join them, not through the service door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian integration", Kavardakov said.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring big investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of NATO and the European Union", Zaev said after filling out his ballot.
He said that the answer would be the key to their prosperous future.
According to a poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday, 30 to 43 percent of voters voted in favor, which is less than the required number of votes.
According to another poll by Telma TV, 57% of Macedonians are still planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote for it.
For a referendum to be successful, it needs to be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the rally would be the first serious blow to the civility of a pro-Western government since May of last year.
Look, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has overcome all of Brighton's defence to get the ball into the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were released from Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Sunday.
Aguero made it look easy to score his own goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker in the middle of the field got a transfer right at the start of the game.
He slipped through Brighton's three defenders until he crossed the free field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jackets.
He bypassed one, then went through several others to Brighton Gate.
Then he transferred to Sterling on his left.
The English striker, reaching the goal, pushed the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, giving it a direction towards Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, and the ball slipped into the right corner of the goal.
"Aguero has some leg problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that moment".
However, the Sky Blues were given an initial advantage in the Premier League by Stirling.
That goal came in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguero got the ball in that game at Brighton's half.
He made a beautiful pass to the left of Leroy Sane.
Shane made a few touches, then passed the ball to Sterling, who was on the other side of the field.
The Sky Blues put the ball in the goal before the boundary was crossed.
City will play a Champions League friendly against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Nederrhein-Arena in Schöneheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take the Rockies by surprise.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, it was pointless for them to start over.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if he can get a game with the Rockies, who are playing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured a spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they still hope to keep the division title.
Even though we're playing for nothing, we can throw the ball, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the crowd, as well as the opposing team, will be at the highest level that I would have faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a start on Sunday, but they're reportedly inclined to let Scherzer run in this situation.
Scherzer, who was supposed to hit his 34th, threw the ball Thursday and will be back on his usual Sunday break.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2⁄3 innings this season.
Trump is at a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched on the situation surrounding the election of his Supreme Council member Brett Kavanagh during a speech on the importance of the Republican referendum midterm elections.
Everything we've done is going to be compromised in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
"This is one of the biggest, biggest elections, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm fighting so hard for good candidates", he said.
Trump went on: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see how it's happening right now.
And they're willing to give back the power at any cost, you see the deceit and the fraud.
They don't care who they offend, who they have to go through to get power and government, that's what they want, and we're not going to give it to them.
"The Democrats", he says, "have a mandate to stand and resist".
And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, rude, bad, and deceitful people".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's call to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that was the worst body language -- worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It's very intolerant of people who express their opinions.
When the activists of the Moment in my local party called me to speak out, it was no surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in the Labour Party to have been told they're not happy to see us here, and all because we're expressing our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she is so strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
As for me, I've been criticized by the conservatives for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
Because of the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and the ridicule of fate on issues like that, where Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notice for the Friday meeting of the East Nottingham Labour Party says: "We want the meetings to be meaningful and productive".
For most of the eight years that I've been a local Labour MP, Friday GC meetings have been like this.
Sadly, many congregations today do not celebrate that, and the policy of kindness and fairness has long since been forgotten, if it ever was.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that everyone's opinion is viewed as acceptable or not acceptable by party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when my colleagues, who I thought shared the same political views, began to expect me to change my views and have views that I would never have otherwise agreed with... whether it was national security or the EU single market.
As soon as I make a public speech, and it doesn't matter what I say, it's followed by a barrage of insults on social media, calling for a re-run of the election, condemning central politics and telling me that I have no right to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments made about me are political.
I'm amazed at the skill and determination of my colleagues who endure sexual or racist abuse every day, but never escape it.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is how the levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that extended church, and every motion of no confidence or change in the election rules makes the party more and more paralyzed.
I've been told many times over the last two years to keep my head down, not to talk so much, and then I'll be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, agitated by being overlooked by the Thatcher government, which had literally caused my comprehensive school classroom to decline, I have been striving to provide even better public services to those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never compromised my politics, and the last election was no exception.
No one in East Nottingham is confused by my political views and my disagreements with the current leadership.
All I'm going to say to those who started the movement on Friday is this: when the country is moving towards Brexit, which will hurt the domestic economy, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, my only statement is not to the Nottingham Monument, but to my supporters, whether Labour or not, and I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of re-election or political expectation will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for East Nottingham.
Air 38-17 Melrose... the Invincible Air is going up.
The last two attempts could have somehow changed the outcome, but Ayr definitely deserved to win on this great and fun day in the Tennis Premiership.
They're now at the top of the table, the only unbeatable side of the decade.
In the end, it was their excellent defense and success that won the home game, and coach Peter Murch had every right to be pleased.
"We have been tested in these games, but we have not been able to win yet, so I should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Aprey Air, they've used their opportunities better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute shot, delivered by Fraser Hughes, pushed Ayr forward, but a yellow card from Rory Hughes in the Scottish Cup against the Warriors gave Melrose an opportunity to score, and Jason Baggott made an irreversible shot.
Clemon had previously extended Ayr's lead with a penalty; after half-time, he scored a point, then tried to make a solo hit to make the score 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's shot, delivered by Baggott, cut the score by five points.
After a long break, caused by a serious injury to Ruard Nott, he was sent off and after the restart, Ayr went further ahead with a hit by Stafford McDowell with a climb.
Air's acting captain Blair McPherson was given a yellow card at the time, and again Melrose hit an extra shot thanks to Bruce Colvin at the end of the angry pressure.
The hosts, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for sending Clymo out of the penalty line without a ball, McPherson fell on Air's forward-moving ball.
Klimbo struck as he started again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe prevented David Armstrong's strike and sent flanker Gregor Henry away to stop the hosts' hyped strike.
The star of Still Game is ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kiera is ready to move into the hospitality industry after it's revealed he's become the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jervis in the popular BBC show he writes and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hempill.
The couple announced that the upcoming series 9 would be the show's final series, and it has emerged that Kieran is planning her life after Craigslist.
According to official listings, he is the CEO of Edreftmore Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
"The sea is ours", landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
The Navajos are guarding the naval headquarters at La Paz.
Public buildings have been flying ocean blue flags.
The slogan of the naval stations stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is: "The sea is ours by law".
It is our duty to restore it".
In land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century's bloody resource conflict with Chile is still alive, as is the desire to sail across the Pacific once again.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the October 1 decision of the International Court of Justice after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has a sense of purpose, it has a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a good ending", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Most Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling, which will be shown on all the big screens in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will side with Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia and give it free access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the local charismatic president of Bolivia, who is now fighting a decisive battle to be re-elected next year, was also instrumental in Monday's decision.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in favor of Bolivia, and it would make little difference if it were.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no control over Chilean territory, and has said that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Since the ICJ's ruling comes six months after the final dispute hearing, it shows that the case was not difficult, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And aside from the further advancement of the Bolivia case, the last four years could have delayed that.
"The issue of Bolivia's access to the sea has been ignored by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
Morales's bellicose rhetoric caused the last vestiges of goodwill on the part of Chile to disappear.
Eventually, Bolivia and Chile will continue to communicate one day, but after that, the discussions will be very complicated.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
In The Hague, the representative of Bolivia and former president of the country, Eduardo Rodríguez Velze, rejected the idea that the court had made a decision with extraordinary speed.
"Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new chapter in relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict in the interests of both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most famous presidents, used the maritime issue as a political base.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to free access to the Pacific", he added.
"Decision gives us the opportunity to see that we need to get past it".
North Korea says there will be no denuclearization until the United States instills trust.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho says his people will never give up nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Sunday.
He urged the United States to follow through on the promises he made at the Singapore summit of opposing leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming closed-door nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong-un more than three months after the Singapore summit.
According to Ri, it is a dream come true that the US continues to impose sanctions, and that objection to the US declaration of the end of the Korean War will never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without a major step in disarming Pyongyang.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the weapons, which the country probably considers the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo is going to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris Fashion Show, we have a new collection of hats that will be coming to the Hay Street in your neighborhood.
If you want to expand your helmet collection and completely protect yourself from the sun, this is what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brownie presented their new collection of large SS19s at Paris Fashion Week, and it surprised everyone.
So, very inefficient hats became an Instagram trend this summer, and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to the podium.
The most striking feature of Valentino's collection was a huge, purple hat with a wide-brimmed hat wrapped around the model's head.
Other oversized accessories include ornate snowflakes, a witch's hat, and even a royal apple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brony also showed off a selection of extraordinary masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips that were more like Hannibal Lecter than high-end cocks.
One piece resembled a diving machine with its tube and glasses, while the other resembled a conch of a molten butterfly.
And if you keep up the high fashion announcement, you'll be successful.
Fashion watchers predict that giant dolls could soon be on your main streets.
The larger-than-usual hats followed La Bomba, a two-foot-wide, curved hat that was seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The adulation of the extremely uncomfortable hat, which was spread all over social media, sent another great piece of art to the podium: a bag of wet beaches, almost as big as a model in a swimsuit.
The dark orange raffia bag, with raffia edges and covered with a white leather handle, was the most sought-after of the SS19 collection by Jacquemère La Riviera during Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Hermitage told FEMAIL, "I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags in the main ward next summer, because the designers have made such an impact that it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
J.E.: Language skills are incredibly important for global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain records of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another astonishing series of test scores, only reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, the arts, music and other community work.
In Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), with over 30,000 pupils, strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can plan and implement a pre-determined curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a widespread and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it will go into their head".
If you speak to a person in his own language, it will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
And we can see from the current results of this year's exams that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest pass rate among independent schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language got a high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72% of students received high A's in Mandarin, while 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of Spanish learners also received A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are favouring foreign languages as a necessary skill that will undoubtedly be required of children and young people in the future.
Now, in independent schools, languages are treated as a subject of choice in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math).
In 2014, the UK's Employment and Skills Commission identified the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill vacancies, with 17% of these being attributed to a lack of language skills.
So, language skills are becoming increasingly crucial to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the more promising job opportunities that require language skills, these skills have become important in the global world.
Whatever career path they choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, in acquiring a life-long skill like this.
Being able to communicate face-to-face with foreigners will automatically put a person who speaks several languages ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey, 75 percent of the 4,000 British adults surveyed were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken at a double-digit percentage of 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, can help children find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more up-to-date classical languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020 - such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is doing, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, and the staff at those schools are experts in that area.
The Scottish Independent Schools aim to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
Now, in this global business environment, there's no denying that languages remain vital to the future of our country, and this needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is scheduled to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James' debut, a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Welton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than a minute, but less than 48", Welton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following the uproar earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to train", he said.
Trump: time for the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five rallies Trump has planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The swearing-in to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are on the verge of losing control of Congress, with votes to be counted in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia today, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via YouTube live below.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearings, which have become a hot topic over sexual misconduct allegations, bringing with it a delay of a week in the Senate confirmation hearings before the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans, who are facing elections in November, to gain momentum.
So, the Trump campaign said that the five rallies next week are aimed at recruiting volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"Congressional oversight is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", said Trump's campaign spokesman, who was not named, according to Reuters.
Today's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to Metro News of West Virginia.
This Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president is here to try to get him elected", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup team of the United States was fighting confidently to keep the hopes alive for Sunday's game.
After three one-sided sessions on a Sunday afternoon, the four could just be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The power-driven bending bar is a completely invented sporting concept that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think the driving force is now?
"They had a six-point lead, which is now four, and I think we're keeping that as a little driving force", said Jordan Speight as he walked that day.
Europe has a clear four-point lead and 12 more to play.
Americans, as Speight says, feel like they have little wind in their coats, even though they have a lot to inspire them, no less than the way Speight and Justin Thomas played each other all day and each of them scored three points from four.
Spieth was deadly during Tee to Green and leads by example.
The celebration's chorus grows louder as his round continues, and he makes the decisive shot to earn a four-yard field goal as he and Thomas give up two-by-two.
His shot, which gave them a 15-point victory, was matched by a similar ball, the kind that tells you he believes the American team is not out of the woods.
"You have to work harder and worry about your game", said Spieth.
This is what each of these players left behind now.
18 holes to make a sign.
The only players who have scored more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetfoot, the undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
Europe's weird but attractive couple is 4 out of 4 and can't go wrong.
The only couple not to have a bogey on Saturday afternoon was Hollywood, but they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning golf.
That run and the way their energy seemed to flow into that crazy crowd and back, confirms that they are the players who should win on Friday, and there will never be a more famous player than Fleetfoot or Molinari to seal a potential European victory before the sun sets at Le Gollon National.
It's preferable to have both at the same time, in different holes.
But the talk of European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson wrote a short paper about Sergio Garcia, the hero of morning golf, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
One bogeyman and two double-deckers on the first nine pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into the hole they never managed to get out of.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
It's so fascinating to look at the four balls and the quarters up close, the relationships between the pairs, the advice they're given, the advice they're not given, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe as a team played better this time around and had a noticeable advance to the final day, but the quarter-finals showed that Team USA showed a level of enthusiasm that no one, especially Stateside, expected.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe had a 10-6 lead.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a big advantage with a 10-6 lead over the United States in Saturday's four-ball and quarterback match.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari changed the score with two wins against the resistance Tiger Wood to take their talisman to even La Golf Nacional by four points.
Thomas Byrne's European side, who were trying to regain their trophy at Hazelton two years ago, took the lead against the American side in the morning's game, 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance during the game, but they failed to win.
Jim Fork's side need eight points from 12 Sunday singles games to get the trophy back.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were named "Mollywood" after the stunning weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they worked hard to beat Woods and American player Bryce DeChambay, by a much larger score of 5-4.
Woods, who had given himself a crush in the two games between Saturday, had shown a brilliant performance, but he had already lost 19 of his 29 games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, having rested from the morning's game, returned to his teammate Henry Stenson in the quarterfinals and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third in the world, 2-1
Europe, however, did not have it in the way it wanted on that pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Triple champions Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas led the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They defeated Spaniards John Rami and Jan Polter 2-1 in a four-ball game and later came back to beat Pockter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 by missing the opening two holes in the quarters.
It's only the second time in Ryder Cup history that a team has come back from a four-point deficit and gone to the singles game, even though Fury's side just need no one to hold the trophy.
After two days of being second best, after the Sunday counterattack, it seems like he's above them.
North Korea says that it will never completely disarm without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were increasing mistrust of the United States, and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's nations that North Korea had taken "significant philanthropic measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and taking responsibility for nuclear nonproliferation.
"However, we don't see any appropriate response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot guarantee our national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm.
While Ri repeated North Korea's familiar grievances about Washington's "slow" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded until it took gradual steps, his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization under control, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the shocking joint statement made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump at the first joint summit in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work on the disintegration of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has always wanted to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls for easing tough international sanctions against South Korea.
"The United States insists that nuclear disarmament is a priority and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective, and even objects to the declaration of the end of the war", Reid said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us down is a direct dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri said nothing about plans for the second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader had highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the side of this denuclearization issue was South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this deadlock".
Even if it were, Ri's speech was a far cry from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that the US missile strike on the North Korean mainland had become inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to annihilate North Korea, praised Kim for his bold steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done, and sanctions should continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
Wednesday, when Trump said he had no time limit, saying it didn't matter if it took two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia insist that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council should continue actively and without fail until the complete, final, and confirmed renunciation of nuclear weapons".
Since 2006, the Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea to disrupt Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rai at the United Nations General Assembly and announced that he would be returning next month to prepare for the second Pyongyang summit.
Pompeo has already made three trips to Pyongyang this year, but the last one didn't go so well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made and that North Korea had been able to accuse him of making "disturbing demands" within hours.
At a meeting this month, North Korea promised to dismantle its missile site and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate action.
He told Kim that the "appropriate measures" are guarantees of Trump's promised stability in Singapore and aimed at improving relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University are taking a special course on how to get enough rest.
The new course gave its graduate students more sleep to combat the growing culture of machos, which is studying all night with the help of caffeine.
The academic found that students at the world's top university often lack the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
This course was designed by Charles Kessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who claims it's the first of its kind in the United States.
She was excited to start her own course on the impact of insomnia on education.
Finally, a girl came up to him and said, "Why did I only know about this now, in high school?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised her very much", she told the Telegraph.
The first class of the year explains to students how good sleep habits can affect academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to start the classes as soon as it became clear that students had not really slept that week.
The one-hour course includes a variety of interactive tasks.
Part of it is a hall where students, by pressing on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books, learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how poor sleep can affect fitness, and the importance of sleep.
Another section explains to participants how prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive map encourages participants to think about everyday life.
We know that this isn't going to change student behavior all at once.
"But we believe they have a right to know about it, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of tobacco use", added Professor Keisler.
He said the "proud culture of staying up all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and its ever-increasing pressure on students means that insomnia is a growing problem.
Good and adequate sleep should be the secret weapon of students to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even prevent weight gain, because sleeplessness turns the brain on to starvation mode, and they're always hungry.
Raymond, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, is helping Professor Keisler organize a class, giving one last year as a freshman at Harvard.
She said the course opened her eyes and inspired her to run workshops throughout the university.
Next, he expects applicants to ask to participate in this educational program before entering the institutional competition.
Professor Kessler advises students to make a memory-based chart of when to go to bed and when to wake up, and to learn about the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LEDs, which can interfere with sleep.
Livingston Rangers 1-0 Menga defeated Gerardsians
Rangers were once again hit by a strike by Dolly Mangan, which led to a 1-0 defeat for Steven Gerrard's team at Livingston.
After a 4-1 defeat at Johnstown in February, Imbrooks were looking to record their first win, but Gary Holtz's side disappointed Gerrard for a second time, losing in the eighteenth game to Ledbrock by 8 points in the Premier League.
Menga came out seven minutes before halftime, and it looked like the Rangers would never be ready to play.
While Rangers are sixth in the table, Livingston go into third place by a few goals, losing to Hibernian.
The Rangers had another problem later, as linebacker Calum Spence sustained a head injury from a throw.
Gerrard's eight-point lead was also broken by Irene's replacement in the semi-finals by Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, joined Livingston last week in the points and was amazed at how his opponents were crushed by his good preparation.
The Rangers may have been dominant, but Livingston was more of a price tagger.
They used two minutes when Megan was first sent off, which gave Scott Pittman a chance to attack Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder stopped the ball.
Kagan Jacobs' shot went to Craig Halkett, but midfielder Alan Lithgow was only able to return the ball.
The Rangers took the game in their hands, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their play.
Alfredo Morelos was due to take a penalty kick after a clash with Steven Loles, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian calls.
Rangers managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Inbrooks goalkeeper Liam Kelly was uncomfortable with Lasagna Colibay and Ove Ijaria's strikes.
Livingston's 34th-minute opening was against the rules, but no one could deny it was a worthy blow.
The Rangers were again unable to resist Jacob's blow.
Scott Arfield did not react to Declan Callagher passing the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed Megan to finish.
Gerard replaced Calibal with Ren Kent at half-time, after which the striker attacked Morelos, but Killy immediately stopped the ball.
Livingston continued to cheer the crowd with his play as Lithgow and Halkit kept the ball with them.
Holt's teammates were able to drive the game in their favour at some stages, but McGregor was able to push Jacobs back before Lithgow hit the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was again given the right to a penalty for his confrontation with Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored the penalty.
The inventor of the Almanac
And now a bit from our Sunday morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the German physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Giger was born.
Giger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the creation of the Giger counter.
The once-famous Giger's counter has become a pop culture staple, as has The Bells of Coronado, starring unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What is that?
ROGER: This is a Giger counter that helps detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you hear the presence of radioactive atoms in minerals.
EV: So, this is really working now.
Hans Giger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on today.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to see foreign cells.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to see foreign cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells.
The point of the method is to take the immune cells from the patient and modify them in the lab dishes.
They'll find proteins that are specific to many types of cancer and then they'll inject them back into the patient.
The vaccine is showing promising results in cancer patients.
One woman who received a vaccine that detects rogue cells found that her ovarian cancer had disappeared after more than 18 months.
The idea of this method is to take the immune cells from the patient and modify them in the lab to detect the proteins that are specific to many types of cancer called HER2 and then inject those cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that the vaccine is promising.
The HER2 gene causes several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancers, explains Professor Berzowski.
The approach of taking immune cells from a patient and training them to detect cancer cells has also helped in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West's appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in the "Make America Great Again" hat has sparked a debate against Trump.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was humiliated at SNL Studios when he began praising the United States. President Donald Trump and he announced that he would be given the job in 2020.
In the "Make America Great Again" hat, he sang the third song of the night, called "City of the Wild", and then he started criticizing the Democrats and supporting Trump.
When I talk to white people, they say, "How can you love Trump? He's a racist.
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America a long time", he said.
SNL began its show with a Matt Daynon impersonation, where the Hollywood star played a scene from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony about Christina Blazy Ford's sexual assault before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although it was not aired, West's video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock did it to get West.
West also complained to the audience that his hat made it difficult for him to wear it.
They slandered me.
They said not to go out in that hat.
They made it in my head.
According to the Washington Examiner, I'm in heaven.
He went on, "You want to see heaven?" as if he wanted to wear his Superman skirt, as if it meant that no one could tell you what to do.
Try to love.
His comments repeatedly angered the audience. SNL members were also worried about the show. Variety reports that one person even said, "The whole studio was stoned".
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-partner died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing "I Love It" as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by Conservative Party leader Candace Thorner, who wrote: "To one of the most generous souls. Thank you in front of the crowd for your support".
The anchor Karen Hunter wrote that West was just what she was, and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I don't want to praise someone by buying their songs, their clothes, or by supporting their art when their ideology is dangerous to my community.
He is free.
"We are the same", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to now officially known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name. He's following Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P. Diddy.
And the Snoop Dogg was renamed Snoop Lane, and indeed the music legend Prince changed his name as a symbol and remained Prince.
There was an attempted stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balichakamore.
On Monday, the defendant will appear in the Belfast County Court.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The film stars Harrington in the role of the poisonous malevolent figure in Game of Thrones.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles make boys think they must be respected to enjoy it.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, 31, confirmed that he is very determined to solve the problem.
"I'm thinking a lot about where we're going wrong with masculinity", he said.
We've taught men how to grow up, and now we're seeing the problem.
Keith believes that television should be partly responsible for teaching toxic masculinity with its many male characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is acquired".
What do they learn from TV and the streets that makes young boys become that kind of man?
I think that's one of the primary problems of our time. How do we change that?
Because it's definitely bad for young boys.
In an interview, he admitted that when the entire series of Game of Thrones ends next summer, he will not play in any more seasons because he is tired of the battlefields and horses.
From November, Kit was supposed to play Sam Shepard's The Wild West in a film about a filmmaker and his thieving brother.
The actor recently confirmed that the first good thing about Game of Thrones is meeting his wife, Leslie.
"I met my wife on the set of this film, and that was the beginning of my future family, and then my life", he said.
In the Emmy-nominated fantasy television series, Rosie played Igrid, the favorite daughter of John Snow as Kitty.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's father's home in Scotland.
China reports a 14 percent increase in cases.
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 cases were reported.
In contrast, most of the cases in the past were sexually transmitted.
In some parts of China, HIV was usually spread rapidly through infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan, Chinese health officials reported that HIV transmission through this route had even been reduced to zero.
But the number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing by 100,000 every year.
Sexual transmission of HIV has become a major problem for the LGBT community in China.
1997 China bans homosexuality, but discrimination against LGBT people is illegal.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is said that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men marry women.
The primary cause of disease transmission is unprotected sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatment available to solve the problem.
Maxime Voltaire denies that the data of the Senators of the Grand Old Party was leaked, claiming that it is a dangerous lie and conspiracy.
United States Rep. Maxime Walter on Saturday condemned allegations that one of his staff members had posted the personal details of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrats confirmed that the complaints were from far-right pundits and web hackers.
"Lies, lies and other offensive lies", the tweeter said in a statement.
The leaked information included home addresses and cell phone numbers belonging to United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mickey Lynn and Orrin Patch of Utah.
The information was posted online by an anonymous person during the Supreme Court hearing on Brett Kavanaugh's sexual abuse at Capitol Hill on Thursday.
The leak came after three Senate hearings on Kavanaugh.
The security websites Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source of the messages matched the address of Waters' office, and that this address was the source of the leaked information about Waters' staff.
Waters went on to say that these baseless allegations are completely false and utterly false.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been exposed as a result of these false and false allegations is in no way responsible for the leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false and utterly false.
Waters's statement was immediately criticized online, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer among the critics.
"This is anger-hate", wrote Flash.
That means he has no interest in becoming a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
He should not argue.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He needs to stay calm and quiet.
Fleisher compared Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of angry behavior during Tuesday's hearings.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro tried to depose Waters in the midterm elections and shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Good, if it's true", he wrote in a soft voice.
In a statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant law enforcement and relevant authorities to the allegations.
"We will pursue the culprits", he continued, "to be held fully accountable for their actions, which have a devastating and devastating impact on any member of my staff".
I'm going to tell you about Johnny English Strikes Again.
It is now a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in a new film that is intended to be in the British language. This seems to be acceptable in the case of the Johnny English action-comedy revival, which began as early as 2003 and was revived in 2011 with the Johnny English revival.
It would be ridiculous self-deprecation to think that we are such an obvious piece of trash to have a chance to export nationally.
Anyway, with his uncanny, small-eyed, unsightly face, Johnny English has been licensed for the second time, which means he's a comedic face for non-English speaking societies.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his oddities, is a bit like Mr. Bean, in his contribution to the chariot of fire song played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He is also originally based on the character of Atticon, a mysterious traveller and internationalist who played a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, creating chaos behind him.
There's a nice moment or two in the last Johnny English.
I loved Johnny English approaching me in a helicopter in a medieval military uniform and a helmet with helicopter shells spinning around.
Atticus's physical comic talent is shown, but the humor has lost its power and is considered redundant, as it is already a part of serious films such as 007 and Mission: Impossible.
Humor is more appealing to children than adults, and to me, it's not as artistic and fixed as Johnny English's character of Bean in Atticus.
Now, in fact, Britain is in serious danger.
Cyber hackers have been able to access the online data of British spies, revealing the identities of secret agents, replacing the agent who plays a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a confused and persecuted Prime Minister who suffers from a sense of political uncertainty. Emma Thompson does the impossible as Theresa May, but there's nothing to do in the script.
The counselors say that since all the spies have been exposed, one of the retirees should be brought back.
This means returning to Johnny English, who now teaches at a number of institutions, but also teaches how to be a covert agent.
The Englishman returned to Whitehall again for a quick chat and was reunited with his former sidekick Buffy, who plays Ben Miller.
Buff is now married and is a submarine commander, in the role of cheerful hockey players, where Vicky Pepperdine has a bit of a slump.
So Batman and Robin make a big mistake and return to the Secret Service, meeting the beautiful woman played by Olga Kurlenko, Ofelia Bullatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has fallen for billiard technicians who believe they can solve Britain's computer problems, Jack Lacey, who plays the villain Jason Volta.
English and Buff begin their series of comedies. As waiters, they set fire to the French restaurant, causing disorder on the Volta ship. The Englishman organizes anarchy by using virtual reality headphones to see what is going on at Walter's house.
Eventually, all the activities were revealed, but because they were fun and interesting, there's a whole children's TV channel about them.
It's rather modest.
I always wonder, with all the other English films, if the British film industry could give Roman Atticus a role that would be really fair to his talent.
Labour claims they are drafting a plan whereby British people will work four days but get paid instead of five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is proposing a plan whereby British people will work four days, but get paid instead of five.
The party wants companies to give their employees an extra day off because of the presence of artificial intelligence.
It would be nice if the workers had three days off, but they would also get paid for the rest of the day at home.
Sources say the idea has been incorporated into the economic agenda, and is intended to transform the country for the benefit of workers.
The idea of a four-day workweek was endorsed by the World Trade Congress as a good way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour spokesman told the Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, the proposal will be accepted".
This is not a problem to be solved in a day, but the idea of a four-day work week is in line with the party's approach to maintaining economic balance, as well as the party's industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, as the Greens have also promised a four-day work week throughout the 2017 campaign.
But this idea is not yet fully considered by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy, and it is not being looked at by the party.
John McDonnell had organised a conference for Labour to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to re-examine the distribution of power in municipal corporations between the shoddy executives and the wranglers.
The Shadow Chancellor also envisages that water company shareholders will not get their full share as the Labour Party may make cuts to account for a number of shortcomings.
He also confirmed that they plan to withhold 10 percent of the companies and pass it on to employees who are cheating up to 500 euros in utility payments.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy told 60 Minutes that the FBI would change its mind about Kavanaugh.
The FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. The question is whether the Bureau's findings could force Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, a reporter for 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more laid back than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
I said I'd be at the hearing, I said I talked to Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment was filed, and I said, "You did it".
He was determined, without hesitation.
Gram is still as quiet as a fish.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's an unfounded accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett is definitely denying it", Graham added, addressing Christina Leslie Ford.
And not everyone he points to can confirm that.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Initiative and will it reduce poverty?
This week, New York City will host the Global Citizen Event, an annual music event featuring some great bands with a great mission to reduce poverty.
This is the seventh year that tens of thousands of people have gathered in Centennial Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness of the event's ultimate goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Initiative is a continuation of the Global Poverty Action Plan, an international advocacy group that aims to increase the number of active campaigners to end poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event, unless you want VIP tickets, you have to do a few things, like volunteer, email the governing body, make phone calls, and do a bunch of other things to help eradicate poverty.
How much has the global citizen accomplished?
Is it a good idea to hire people with free tickets, or do they just feel good about the idea that they can make a difference just by emailing?
Global Citizen notes that since its inception in 2011, 19 million actions have been taken by its supporters for various purposes.
These actions are said to have helped to mobilize world leaders and raise more than $37 billion, which could change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group received 390 appeals and applications, which have raised nearly $10 billion.
The group reports that the fund's funds could go directly to some 659 million people around the world.
The calls were primarily directed to the Power of Nutrition, an investor company in the United Kingdom whose vision is to develop children's full potential. After receiving 4,700 posts from Global Citizen, it promised to give Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition.
"We can make history against social injustice for malnutrition with the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, including you", said Tracey Ullman, the Food Power ambassador, at her live concert in London in 2018.
The group also reported that, following more than 5,000 initiatives to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government decided to fund the Nutrition Power programme, which will help ensure that 5 million women and children are fed.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the web is: "What makes you believe that we can end poverty?"
Global Citizen says, "It's a long and difficult road, with setbacks and failures.
Like the civil rights and anti-corruption movements before us, we will succeed because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cary Bean, Janelle Mona are among the stars who came to the New York event, hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Secretary of the Interior, the United States could use the Navy to disrupt Russian energy exports.
"Washington could use its navy to block Russian energy supplies, including to the Middle East, if it wants to", said U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zink, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
The military added that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is a legitimate invitation by the government, is a new prerequisite for finding new markets.
"I believe they will sell their energy to the Middle East, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States, with our navy, has the ability to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, can block them to make sure that their energy doesn't go to market", he said.
Zincke was addressing the event, which was hosted by the Consumers Alliance for Energy, a nonprofit organization that bills itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel substitution and fuel maximization", he said, presenting Russia as a "tricky pony with a crude-fuel economy".
According to the statements, the Trump administration was fulfilling its mission to increase LNG exports to Europe by replacing Russia by offering European consumers a cheaper option.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, have been trying to convince Germany to abandon the "irreconcilable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a Moscow asset.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was built to double the pipeline's existing capacity to 110 square meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition to Washington's project is simply economically justified and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we are in agreement that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was countered by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (FDG), has urged the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply", said Daughter Camp, president of the Federation of German Industries (GFA), after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be very careful about running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be paying close attention to running for president after the midterm elections on Saturday.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the head of the wife", she said, according to Hill.
After November 6th, I'm going to focus on running for president.
In a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his opinion about President Donald Trump, saying that he is taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was candid in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavin.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "Of course we need a Federal Reserve investigation before the vote".
A poll on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents think he shouldn't run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be running.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick has more supporters, with 38 percent in favor of his possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names touched on the 2020 list of possible candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
At the rally for Donald Trump, Sarah Palin speaks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Tarek Palin.
Tarek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
On Monday night, she was arrested and fined for domestic violence.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he gets back, I can speak to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with", he told the crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his detention a "silent room" and said of his friend and other war veterans, "They come back a little bit changed, they come back tense, they come back wondering if they'll find respect for all that their fellow veterans and pilots and other members of the military have given to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and fined for domestic violence against a woman, according to a report of domestic violence and alcohol-impaired gun use, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, Washington, are supporting the new asylum policy challenge.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to people fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories briefed in Washington on Friday as court advisers to support anti-asylum policies, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name is Grace W. Augustin. The hearing of the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy is not disclosed.
He told his partner and the boys in his powerful criminal gang insulted him but on July 20th, US officials denied his asylum request.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers in the state supporting Grace have listed El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations with persistent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was in direct conflict with a 2014 decision by the Immigration Review Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who had been victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Rasi of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, state and international law".
"The state law requires that all asylum claims must be tried based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claims, and such a ban does not uphold that principle", the court counsel said briefly.
The lawyers then briefly discussed the fact that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is damaging to the U.S. economy, saying that they are potential entrepreneurs and suppliers of needed labor.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop giving asylum to victims of gangs and domestic violence.
"The asylum is for those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts were made in Palo, as the death toll on the way to find the fighters doubled.
For the fighters, it was pretty terrible.
"It was very hard", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was caring for her little boy with a high fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, the EMTs are bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
They saw the residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their belongings from the abandoned areas, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded in the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were lying in Palus Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent severe concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he described how he felt when a powerful earthquake shook the five-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was crushed under the rubble, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of intimidating with propaganda.
A week after China's official newspaper in the US published a four-page advertisement praising the benefits of US-China trade every day, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda through the US media.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid-for version of the Des Moines Register, the largest selling newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election showed what US officials told Reuters, that this is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a worsening trade war, which has resulted in them equalizing the score by imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
The aggressive tariffs imposed by China earlier in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa, which has supported Trump's Republican Party, American and Chinese experts say.
The U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Branstead, who was the longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China has hit American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Branstead wrote in his column for the Des Moines Register on Sunday, by putting propaganda ads in our own free press, China is now duplicating that persecution.
"By distributing paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's long tradition of free speech and freedom of the press", Branstead wrote.
"On the contrary, given that the press is heavily controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, there is a limited number of conflicting views in the paper's printing here on the Beijing street, and it is impossible to see a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic path", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most popular newspapers had refrained from publishing his offer, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans in Kavanaugh's scenario are pushing women voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
While many senior Republicans have stuck to their position and are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will face opposition in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment was overwhelming, and a majority of Republicans officially declared that they wanted to continue the vote.
"These things are impossible to turn back", said Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Rieher said he doubted that a last-minute assertion by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake about the need for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow or in November", according to The Washington Times, said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the MovOn Progressive Group, on Friday.
On Friday morning, when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, protesters chanted in the Senate lobby during a protest: "November is coming", reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation from the Democrats will be tremendous", non-partisan political analyst Steve Rothenberg told the news site.
People say it's high, that's true.
But it can be higher, especially amongst the more conservative voters in the outskirts, and amongst the younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don't like the president, but don't often vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony about sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts speculated that if the Republicans decided to endorse him, there might be a backlash.
"It's a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be on the court, but how the Republicans approached it and how they reacted to it", Guy Cecil, who heads the Priorities USA group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents probably or confidently believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent probably or confidently believe Kavanaugh.
What's more, 38 percent think Kavanaugh probably or probably lied in his testimony, and 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's claim, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted him while he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a Yale University dinner party in 1980.
The author of World Wide Web is planning to create a new web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of World of Warcraft, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The program uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online data warehouse.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal data storage is that the user decides who can access the information.
The company calls it data-driven expansion of personal rights and opportunities.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company will allocate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform offered by IBM, a few veteran developers who were hired to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether to make a complete change in places where their business models are completely changed in a second.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Sardine Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even when Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, a Victorian-Cross-winning clergyman during World War I, grew up
The only Anglican clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I grew up in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant General Father Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Belanglis and Lecoeur.
But four days later, he was shot dead by a sniper, not knowing he had been awarded Britain's highest military award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said, "It's very symbolic that the monument will be opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning act".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant General Bernard Vann led his battalion through the St Quentin Valley through a very dense fog and under fire from field guns and machine guns.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and, with the utmost civility, pushed the line forward, then single-handedly quickly picked up a field gun and slaughtered three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant general was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that I know I'll never be worthy of, but that deserves respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor to be part of the parade, adding that the dignity of a true hero is reflected in the support shown by so many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they saw Piggy Peppa.
Imagine not sleeping through the night watching Bellator 206 in a crowded hall, just because you weren't allowed to watch the main event.
San Jose was due to host 13 matches, including six main ones, which were to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock, just as the Red Moose and Rory McDonald were about to fight, the UK audience was stunned when they started showing Piggy Pepp.
Many were not impressed, for they were left up until the morning for a special duel.
One fan on Twitter described this transition to a children's cartoon as a cruel joke.
"It's a state regulation that says content like this at 6 o'clock is not appropriate, so they had to switch from kids' shows", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said in response to a question about the switch.
Yes, to Piggy Pappy.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they're going to work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about repetition, I think we can do it", said Coker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday morning there, so we can't do it until 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, which is Monday by their time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when the show was changed there were a lot of messages, none of which were lovely.
We were trying to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a state-level problem.
I can promise you that next time, it won't happen again.
We're going to cut the number of matches from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give more to the fans, but we failed.
This is a surprising situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says it wasn't until he went to high school that he realized that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, which was first hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out for gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that since he became a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Longtime regular Kirsty Young took a few months off due to illness.
In her first talk show, Laverne, Daly said that she grew up feeling inferior to others because loving boys and girls was unacceptable in society.
He said, "Today, that feeling of being inferior and different from others is actually what gives me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove he was something so people wouldn't be disappointed when they found out about his sexual orientation.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent advocate for LGBT rights and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he was lucky to live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American film director Dustin Lance Blake, in 2013 was a surprise to her.
Last year, Daly married an Oscar-winning director 20 years her senior, but she says the age gap was never a problem.
He said that when you're going through so much at such a young age -- he competed in his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- it's hard to find someone from the same age who's gone through the same wildlife.
The couple had a son in June, Robert Ray Blake-Dale, and Dale says that the whole picture changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say the whole point is to win the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer.
Daly said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was that if they won a ticket to the London 2012 Games, he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you're not going to be there to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he was not invulnerable", she said.
The following year, she competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I'd been dreaming about all my life, diving in front of a home-grown Olympic crowd, couldn't be a better feeling", she said.
It also influenced her first song, which was Heather Small's "Proud", which accompanied her throughout her Olympic training and which she still fondles.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, is in the reserves for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form if he doesn't want it to turn into a disaster.
He's playing in his 12th bi-annual tournament, but coach Jim Furyk has left him on the bench for Sunday's game.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as so often happens, the five-time winner spent half his day as a fan and the other half working on his game in the stadium, trying to fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old, who was not even one of the best first-timers at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National course, where mishaps usually punish wrong-throwers.
And even if the Ducks themselves aren't so scared, Michelson will face British Open champion Francisco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with young Tommie Fitwood, who has won every game this week.
If the Americans, who are four points clear of the other 12 individual games, get off to a good start, Michelson's game could be decisive.
Furyck had told his boys about the rebellion, not that he had anything more to say.
"He fully understood his role today, he put his hand on my shoulder, he hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", said Furyuk.
He has great confidence in his powers.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's given so much to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I had more planned, but it turned out that way, and I think that's the way we should have gone.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really matched his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence adds something unimaginable to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic and sarcastic, he likes to play tricks on people, and he's a great teammate", she explained.
I think the young players had fun playing against him this week, and it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game.
Europe's senior Thomas Byrne knows that the great advantage may soon be gone
Europe's Thomas Byrne knows from experience that a significant advantage before the Ryder Cup final can easily turn into a disadvantage.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderama, where the Black Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage at Valderrama, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but with a slight advantage", Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and go 10-6 overall at Le Golf National yesterday.
So the story will show me and everyone on this team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will be at your best.
Come out and do it right.
Nothing is done as long as you have points on the dashboard.
We have a goal, to try and win this prize, and that's what we're focused on.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also recognize who's on the other side, the best players in the world.
After being impressed by the way his players performed on the difficult golf course, Björn added: "I could never outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow is all history.
Tomorrow is the one-on-one, and that's a whole different thing.
It's nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, you're having a complete experience as a golfer.
That's the message you're going to send to the players, make the most of tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner, who also has to do his best tomorrow.
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored 3 out of 4 points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these last day's twists, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, then ending up in the losing position, so that Europe was out of the Medina miracle.
"I remember every damn word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, '99 senior, had assembled his players before the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but you'd want to go right ahead of time, like we did in Brooklyn and Medina.
When that impulse somehow starts to work, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We're picking our lineup and we're giving the guys a chance to try and do something amazing tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight, he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, the other Europeans in the first half are Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I picked the guys in this order because I think it's the right order from start to finish", Byrne said of his players.
The launch of the new German battleship was once again delayed
The new German Navy frigate was to be launched in 2014 to replace Cold War-era battleships, but that won't happen until at least the end of the year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media report.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman quoted Die Zeit newspaper as saying.
The ship was to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but concerns arose after delivery that prevented the ambitious project from being completed.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful missile, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some secret technologies such as reduced radio detection, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service lives: it should be possible to deploy new frigates away from local ports for up to two years.
But the continuing delays mean that the super-modern warships that are said to allow Germany to increase its influence abroad will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigates made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based shipbuilding company Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilding company after it had been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German press points to a number of key programmatic and technical flaws that would render the battleship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The programming flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be manned by a crew of 120 sailors, which is half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be considerably heavy, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to make further improvements.
It is said that at 7,000 tons, the Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class that Germany used during World War II.
Aside from the equipment, the overall cost of the project, including the training of the staff, also becomes a problem.
It's said to have grown from an initial €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems with the new frigates are even more important in light of recent warnings about the weakening of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy is actually running out of ships that can be deployed.
The official said the problem has grown over time as older ships have been decommissioned but not replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could replenish the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret lives of bats
A new study in a reserve in the Scottish Highlands is trying to figure out how bats use the landscape to taste food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help in their future conservation.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and rodent bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and Dobenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed around the main site to monitor the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile tests using hand-held sensors.
Experimental analysis of all the recordings will measure the frequency of the bee's vocal signals, clarify which species are doing what.
Then a map of the natural environment and a report are compiled to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS environmental consultant Rob Duar hopes the results will reveal which natural habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of environmental management efforts such as the creation of herbivores, and help to determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has fallen dramatically over the last century.
They're endangered by construction and development that affects their natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a threat, as can sticky paper for moths and chemical processing of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
The bees are not actually blind.
However, their habit of hunting at night makes their ears more useful than their eyes when it's time to catch.
They use sophisticated sound-tracking techniques to find insects and block their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes the butterfly very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, check the settlements and occasionally carry out rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only butterfly reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 butterfly species.
The park's manager, David Thompson, says the park is the perfect place for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a huge area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees, all good for living.
But we don't know much about flies yet, so the work we're doing here and in other compounds will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed that it was important to check for bats and to do new conservation work inside the reserve, because accidental destruction of one habitat could kill up to 400 females and young bats, thus possibly wiping out the entire population.
The bees are protected, and killing them, harassing them, harassing them, or destroying their belongings is illegal.
Elizabeth Farrell of the Scottish Bee Conservation Trust urged people to rally to help them.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we still don't know how many species live.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people want to use his name to advertise themselves.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorgui, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It was confirmed that he then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made, in a live Instagram video with his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, called the claims "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
"What they're saying today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be recognized by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is very good", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are set to sue Der Spiegel on charges they call "individual unacceptable statements".
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the gambler is seeking compensation for the psychological damage "in proportion to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Mayorga went to the player's room, where he likely raped her.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, fell at his feet and told him that he was 99% a better guy, that he was wrong because of the 1%.
The documents show that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sexual relations, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorka also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken at the hospital, but then agreed to a settlement without a court because she feared retaliation and did not want to embarrass herself in public.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she is still suffering the consequences of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged accusations, Ronaldo had almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Britain will forever regret losing the car manufacturers.
Britain will forever regret losing its reputation as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was worrying when Toyota told the BBC that if England left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Brunswick plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that border delays due to a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Brunswick plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if England leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Brunswick.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about how cross-border trade would work in the event of a no-deal exit, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's going to close its Mini factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
According to carmakers, their main concern is the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production is based on the "just in time" principle, whereby parts for cars are supplied to the UK and EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there will be disruptions at the border, which the manufacturers say could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production would be halted.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers programme for the future relationship with the EU was "clearly determined to be free of border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not just to have the success we have now, but to take advantage of the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
And not just Toyota, but other car manufacturers, they're showing us that we absolutely need to continue to have high-efficiency supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector and ultimately, cut jobs.
Peter Cuevallaris, who has worked at Brunston for 24 years and is the head of the Mass Union in the factory, said that his members are very worried: "In my experience, if jobs like this go away, they never come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump and Rosenstein may meet again, the White House says.
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed another week as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aid and Russia, and possible miscarriages of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would remove the deputy attorney general, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been a source of heated speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the possibility of wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, under the pretext of announcing his resignation.
Instead, they announced a meeting with Trump on Thursday, who was in New York at the United Nations at the time.
Trump said he preferred not to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a clash with the Judiciary Committee, which was examining the testimony of Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual assault, Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was speaking on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "The date is not set yet, it could be this week, I think it's going to be postponed for another week, given everything that's going on at the Supreme Court".
But, we'll see, I always like to keep the press updated.
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The anchor Chris Valance asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of conferences was not due to a resentment of the show-business behavior of television reporters, however, he said, "I don't deny the fact that it's showbusiness behavior".
Then he said that there would be more direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president attends more Q&A meetings than any president before him", he said, without pointing to any evidence.
The hearings will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that over the last few weeks, and it's going to happen again at a press conference where you're going to be able to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with top officials.
Private press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why he's acting so rashly and sometimes strangely in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Health Minister writes to NHS Scotland's EU staff about concerns about Brexit.
The Health Minister has written to NHS Scotland's EU staff to express their country's gratitude and their wish to stay on in the context of Brexit.
MSP Jane Freeman sent a letter saying that she would leave within six months of Britain leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to accept the costs of applying for residency status for EU citizens who have worked in its public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU negotiations on leaving continued over the summer, leading to decisions expected this autumn.
But the British government has also pushed ahead with its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is going to be a very unfortunate time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you again and again how much I value the contributions of every staff member, regardless of nationality.
Our partners in the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve our healthcare work, and benefit our patients and the public.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercomb is in emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christian Abercombe has undergone emergency surgery for a head injury after Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly after the semifinals.
"He went over the sideline and it was like he hit it right there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercomb oxygen on the sidelines before he was transferred to the bench and sent for further examination.
Tennessee state official Chris Harris told WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercomb is undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that details about the type/degree of injury are not yet available, and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercomb, a two-year starter, is in his first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five power tricks before he was out of the game on Saturday, which added to his total of 18 power tricks this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the stamp when they buy property in England.
Foreign buyers of property in England will pay more for the stamps with the extra money that Tory's new plan is designed to help the homeless.
This move would neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The tax increase will stay for those who don't pay taxes in England.
The Treasury is planning an increase of up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will pay more for stamp duty when they buy property in England than the extra money that's being spent to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Corbyn's desire to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting the higher-income class.
The increase in the rent will remain for individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes in England, which will provide additional money for the government to fight the problem of homelessness.
The premium, which is added to the current flagship rent, including the high-end second home and rental purchases presented two years ago, can be equal to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that this move will bring in £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-English nationals, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many of the wealthier areas of the country, especially the capital, have become urban hubs because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the city.
One week after Boris Johnson's approval of the flagship price cut, a new policy will be implemented that will allow more young people to buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of seizing land but not using it to keep house prices high and convinced Mrs May to make affordable housing affordable to solve England's embarrassing housing problem.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including the control of mortgages and the end of the court-ordered disposal of property.
He also wants to give local governments more power to build new homes.
Miss May said, "Last year, I said that I would do my job to help revive the English dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-English-based organisations based abroad to buy a house as it is for the working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of having a home becomes more unattainable, and the contempt of homelessness becomes more real.
Jack Ross: My main goal is to run Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's governor at some point.
Scott, 42, is enjoying the challenge of rebuilding the North-East club, who are now in third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having been recalled from St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up seeing Scotland with my dad in Hampden as a kid, and it was something that always stuck with me.
That would only happen if I was a successful club leader.
As manager of Sunderland, Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Alordis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane and Paulo Di Cano.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he feels no discomfort at such a big club following such stable people who have previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back to the Premier League.
With the structure and the capabilities of this club, it definitely belongs in the Premier League.
It's not an easy task to achieve, but I'll probably only see my success if I can bring the club back there.
Ross is just three years into his managerial career, after spending 15 months as assistant manager at Dumbarton and on Hearts' leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division, and transformed St Mirren from relegation to the Championship winner's title the following season.
And Ross says he feels better now than he ever did at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical during his playing career.
"It was probably a real choice", he said about taking responsibility for Alloa.
I sincerely believe that management was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was playing well, and I made a good living from it, and I enjoyed some important heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot to go through during the week.
I'm still going through all of this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management is more soulless.
I've always wanted to lead, and now that I'm doing it, I feel much more comfortable than I've ever done in my entire adult life.
You can hear the full Sportsound interview on Saturday 30 September on Radio Scotland, from 12pm to 1pm (BST).
According to research, the best time to drink is on a Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat provides a revenue stream for struggling pubs in England, but it also adds more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, bar groups have a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue is down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA business consultancy that uncovered the data, said: "Continuing hot weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup appearance have forced July to follow the pattern of last month, June, when bar revenues rose by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which have been hit hardest".
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Drinking made bars and pubs do better than it did to reduce restaurants.
Food also reduced pub activity in the summer, though not as bad as restaurants.
It seems like people just go out for drinks.
Pub and bar beverage sales are up 6.6 percent in one month, and food is down 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from the RSM analysis of entertainment and hospitality, said, "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April".
Weather and the influence of important social and sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to outdoor market sales.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales will particularly affect the current spending peaks.
A long hot summer couldn't be worse for food producers, and over time it will become clear whether the milder temperatures in August will provide some of the expected rest.
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, impacting declines in brand investment.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in pubs, bars and restaurants across England, collected and analysed the performance of 47 operating groups that had a combined income of £9 and is a benchmark for the sector.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they're hiding from their parents.
According to the study, one in five 11-year-olds has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 middle school students found a rise in fake Instagram accounts.
This news has reinforced fears that sexual information is being spread.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account to show their parents.
One in five 11-year-olds has a social media account that they're hiding from adults.
A study of 20,000 middle school students found a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts linking to the photo sharing site Instagram.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual information is being spread.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean basic account to show their parents, while also having personal accounts.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website revealed a young man who persuaded others to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, half of whom admit to having a personal account.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that so many young people are tempted to create an online platform where parents and teachers can't find them.
Ellie Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eli Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the Scottish Athletic Council's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected lightweight athlete and President Ian Biddi said the move was a good opportunity for sporting authorities to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Ellys is well respected by athletes in Scotland, England and around the world, and we are confident that recommending her will greatly benefit athletics in Scotland", said Biddy.
Doyle said, "I'm very passionate about being the voice of the athletes and hopefully really getting a feel for and helping to run the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago on this day, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and how much.
It was a lot of hard work, but I made a full recovery, learned how to walk again, and now I'm doing mobility exercises.
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
The breast pump commercial that compares mothers to cows is getting a lot of attention online.
The Breast Pump Association has put an ad online that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To introduce what they call the world's first silent wearable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a light-hearted music video, a commercial, showing what freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real moms dancing in a cow barn full of grass under a song that has words like, "Yeah, I'm lying, but you can't see a tail", and if you haven't noticed, these aren't anyone else's, these are my breasts.
The choir goes on. "Push them, push them, I can feel it, baby, push them, push them, I'm singing my songs".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has been the subject of controversy on the online platform.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it mocked the dairy industry's "horrors".
It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to have milk, except that their babies aren't stolen from them within days of birth.
The Elvie breast pump is inserted into the feeding ribcage (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for mother and child".
But, yes, why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who buy it to hold their babies?
Another added, "What kind of unrealistic advertising?"
Others defended the ad, one woman admitting that she thought the song was very funny.
I think that's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I could still breastfeed.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
"This is a great product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad that targets mothers who are nursing (often in their workplace or bathroom) and feel like they're being shunned".
This is not an ad that praises or criticizes dairy.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with pumps hidden in their chests.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely unattended, has no wires or tubes, and is inserted into the feeding tube, allowing the woman to move freely, hold the baby, and even leave the house during the cradle.
Anna Ballarin, ECD and partner at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a lively and provocative release.
By running parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all the challenges it brings, in a fun and relatable way, to show the incredible feeling of freedom that comes with the pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie Pump has been in the spotlight.
At London Fashion Week, two moms appeared on stage with designer Marta Yakubovsky, using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children slowly moved to tent camp along the Texas border.
Although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively the same, the number of identified immigrant children has increased rapidly, in part because the Trump administration's strict policies have made it difficult to provide children with guardians.
Usually, many of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid to jeopardize their chances of staying in the country by demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when state authorities announced that potential sponsors and adult household members would be required to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unmarried children.
Then the service confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior convictions.
About 80 percent of the people who are guardians or family members of guardians are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are criminal aliens.
So we're still looking for these individuals", Mr. Alben said.
To speed up the investigation of children, officials introduced a new law that could require them to appear in court within a month of being exposed, instead of the 60 days that the prosecutor's office and staff had previously established as the standard.
Many will appear via video conference calls, rather than in person, to petition the immigration court to legalize their case.
Those who don't meet the requirements will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer these children are in detention, the more likely they are to become paranoid or depressed, which can lead to outbursts and escape attempts.
Experts say that this concern is greater in large areas like Tornillo, where, because of the large area, it's easier to see the suffering of children.
They added that moving children to shelters without preparing them psychologically or giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends could leave them traumatized, which many already suffer.
Syria is telling the US, France and Turkey to withdraw their occupying forces.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Mu'aleem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for eight years.
Muallem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are in Syria illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and should be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Muallem claimed that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue this holy fight until it clears all the territory of Syria from both terrorist groups and the presence of foreigners in Syria.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training or advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a country in a state of war.
Speaking about refugees, Moualem said conditions are good for their return and accused some Western countries of spreading anti-racism fears, which pushes refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement to end the war between Assad and his opposition forces.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has opened the way for political talks to proceed.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the state, which is home to 3 million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "destroyed".
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition representatives to draft a constitution for post-war Syria, paving the way for elections.
Muallem presented the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee's proceedings, saying that the committee's activities should be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Second Term
So, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal TV viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandals don't end his presidency early.
This is without a doubt the most tragic end to the presidency ever.
At this point, there's no fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled at CNN to 1.05 million, and tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox New averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up 1.7 million from four years ago, says Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers during prime-time news nights.
"This is a fire that people are looking for because it's something we don't understand", said Neil Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", a film about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is attacked.
Neil Scogel, the veteran comedy writer who wrote "Just Funny Episodes: A Few Cruel Truths" about breaking into a Hollywood boys' club, has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why, he asked.
She said, "Because she makes me laugh", Mrs. Schuchel told me.
There's value in having fun in chaos.
Of course, regardless of what's on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wayne, whether or not immigrant families can join, and regardless of the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen to watch for six hours as a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of unforeseen sources for his book "The Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 coat, and Hurricane Daniel's inappropriate portrayal of Trump, um, anatomy.
I'm never going to look at Super Mario the way I used to.
Speaking about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns of the script -- getting into a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un -- Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, said, "To make it look like a reality show, he specifically tells you something every day".
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you'll be left behind.
When I called Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Hawaii, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get himself out because Brett Kavanaugh was going to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
I remember when we used to do these crazy shows, people would say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Inside money flows into the House of Representatives hot midterm elections
It's no surprise that there's a huge cash flow to Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, thanks to the redistricting that's resulting in me running for one seat from the two current members of the House of Representatives.
The newly reorganized Pittsburgh suburban district is currently being contested by Democrat Conor Lamb, a current member of the House, who was elected from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely coincides with the current 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled last January that the old districts were unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of the Republicans.
In the newly formed 17th Congressional District, the race resulted in a campaign finance contest between the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning the March 18 Pennsylvania primary by a narrow margin.
For 10 years, the seat was held by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give little advantage to the Democrats.
The United States weighed in on the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017, and also had a hotel in Panama before his colleagues kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only intended against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in 2017 in U.S. sales, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and crime rates.
In parallel with the progress of the internal meetings, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference that would have been devoted to security and economic prosperity and would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending the intent to punish El Salvador.
Vice President Michael Pence is now expected to speak at the mid-October summit, a sign of the administration's importance to the meeting, the diplomats said.
Three American diplomats returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh stimuli or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal discussions on condition that their names not be disclosed.
Their estimates were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next step could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice, which there is very strong evidence of in public records.
It's been said that Mr. Mueller is leading his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our election.
If there is a change in leadership in Congress, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in that structure, just as he is going to meet again with voters, and perhaps with his fellow deputies.
I mean, there are a number of assumptions, and I'm not going to suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long this fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support the Czechoslovak representatives in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the carnage that has been going on for years.
These are turning points in history, and the development of the brutal events of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Now Americans are living through those turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's running the fate of Mr. Mueller's intelligence?
Rosenstein has been in a state of disarray since this document revealed that last year he offered to wiretap the president and questioned his legitimacy.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times' account was wrong.
What are we going to do if the newly interviewed FBI investigation of Brad Kevin is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
But first, we're going to vote for Congress in a midterm election, to which Mr. Trump will be accountable.
If we fail these tests, democracy will continue through the long winter.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother is a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported from Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived by immigrating to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles with a swastika on that table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?
Norman Eason, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chairman of ethics and accountability at Citizens in Washington, and author of The Last Palace: Europe's tumultuous century in five lives and one legendary house.
Ranger Graham Dorrance was optimistic before the crash of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win over Austria, which followed the impressive results of Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in high positions to qualify as Group G in the Europa League.
Due to a shoulder injury in the semi-final, Graham Dorrance missed his first race of the season before Villarreal's 2-2 result, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to do bigger things.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are on the right side", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game believing we were going to get something, and we got it.
Maybe we could catch it at the end, generally, the score of zero was probably fair.
They probably played better in the first round and we played better in the second round.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good tone last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push forward and have a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened as a result of my injuries and the changes at the club, but the current position is very pleasant.
The team is great, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move on now, put the past behind us and be successful.
Women lose sleep over the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be saved, few of them talked about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children about it.
"People want to save their family members, but they don't take steps to make that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's where you start.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them what you want ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss when and where you want to receive care, as these options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor, who can also help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Your sources of funding for long-term care might include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, which will help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets for as long as you have money.
Get your legal papers, avoid the legal hassle.
Get your trusted healthcare provider to have someone you trust to take care of your healthcare and make sure the specialist is up to date in case you can't communicate.
Also, remember the importance of a lawyer to your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your payments are made if you are incapacitated.
Remember the details: Imagine that your adult parent needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down those details so you're ready.
"It's not just the financiers who work here, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have that plan?
In the infragrance, the man fired several shots with an air rifle.
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home from a night walk.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his shooter.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is still expected to rise.
Due to the loss of telecommunications, emergency services were unable to obtain any information from the Dongalla area, the area north of Palu that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongalla on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a region of over 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The region, which is an administrative district, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the cornerstones of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially for the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also very important to the region, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and damaged hundreds of dams in Dongola.
The tsunami also damaged the western part of Dongola in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific volcanic belt, where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years.
2004: A major earthquake in the Aceh region of Indonesia's west coast struck northern Sumatra on December 26, affecting 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast region of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook northern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami in the southern region, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An above-ground earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly and devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, the tsunami did not happen, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed hundreds of buildings and temporarily displaced thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trey Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
A 29-year-old Peele, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence broadcast and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of the women she knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took the phone away.
Palin is in pre-trial detention in Man-Suu isolation and is being held on a $500 bail, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he stood in front of the courthouse, where, when asked to accept the plea, he declared "certainly not guilty", the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is now pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence broadcast, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend claims he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups harshly criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of victims
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been disrupted, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The quake was recorded near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered in Palo City for a beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terror attack, which is rare.
In New York, federal judges are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipow, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not used in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was attacked in a truck, allegedly rented from Home Depot, on the Inner Side of Manhattan's bike path, beating pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is possible for both articles.
Weeks after the attack, jurors beat Saipov to a pulp, charging him with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, money laundering, which prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as assault and vehicle destruction.
The attack required "considerable planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as "abhorrent, cruel and immoral".
Saifullo Habybuliyevich Saipov has caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lore Decadent, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccio, the announcement of the intentions said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
The last time a death sentence was handed down in the Southern District of New York was 10 years ago.
In September 2009, the defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Esther Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, after days and months, the Uzbek national Saipov has not shown any signs of remorse.
Police say he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of the Islamic State on his phone.
He also asked for an Islamic State flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that instead of a life sentence without the right to be released by confession, the death penalty would only prolong the trauma that these events have caused for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says responsibility for Brexit negotiations should be on NATHEL FRANCE
At the Tory conference today, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the people's army.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should feel the warmth of Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boone, a Conservative MP, told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would be out of the woods if Mr Farage was a Brexit minister.
But Theresa May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was made even more pronounced after she joined the Tories in the anti-Brexit demonstration.
Amidst the backlash from both the pro- and anti-Brexit parties, as well as the EU, the prime minister is trying to keep his "Shasky" compromise plan.
Allies insisted that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his proposed package and chaos.
Mr. Ben at Solihull, "Retire means leave", said at a protest that he wanted to quit chess.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and put the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels on him.
"If he was responsible, we would have been out by now", he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the cheese".
In presenting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative who was also at the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chess doesn't have a lot of popularity, the opposition doesn't have the courage to vote for it, it doesn't have the sympathy of our party, and the activists who are the first to go out and vote for us.
Please stop chess and start listening.
In a tough statement to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that the politicians marching should feel the heat if they are on the verge of overturning the 2016 decision.
"Today, it's a matter of trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you suffer this.
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to give warmth to our political class on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has given us our victory in Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham, then staged a two-hour protest in the city centre.
Several activists were waving Tory flags after the anti-Brexit flag group was formed this week.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives at the opening of the conference over the security issues with their party's mobile app.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have all the IT technology to have Canada plus plus plus, a free trade border with Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking about his future at a town hall rally in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November and will face Republican Rep. Jeff Deeley, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There are rumours that he may challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood on Saturday afternoon was Trump's 36th meeting with voters in a town hall format since becoming president.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and rebuild the broken government, including the highest office.
Arrested in connection with the LSU Sims shooting.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference, which was held at the Baton Rouge Police Department.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed outside the Southern University student district on Friday morning.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died, police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and got a slap on the wrist from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene and being armed and admitted to shooting Wade Simpson.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the Baton Rouge East Paris Police Station.
Sims, a 6-foot (1.98 m) third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Cup when team tactics give him a win over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walter Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that team tactics would play a big role in the race.
From the single, Bottas started well and nearly crushed Hamilton, holding his position for the first two laps and urging Wettel to attack his teammate.
Wettle got in a bad situation first and let Hamilton hit the tail of the pack, which should have been the deciding factor.
Mercedes later entered the circuit and exited behind Wettel, but Hamilton took the lead with a sharp step, with the Ferrari driver reluctantly exiting the inner track, at the risk of being stopped after a double-step to protect himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from behind the starting grid and was seventh at the end of the first period on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race and was aiming to get to the finish quickly and overtake Kimmy Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finally made the point in lap 44, but failed to increase speed in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen came in fourth.
It's a tough day because Walter has done a fantastic job all weekend and as a gentleman, he let me pass.
"The team did such an extraordinary job, one or two", said Hamilton.
I was a little nervous about the fact that I was going to be a doctor.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during the campaign when she claimed she had not distributed a letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault by Christine Blaise Ford.
In his speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "too many and mean and liars".
"The one thing that could have happened, and the one wonderful thing that's been happening in the Senate over the last two days, is when you witness the anger, when you see angry people and the evil and the wrath and the liar", he said.
When you read the press releases and the mainstream news, then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get the word out?
Remember his answer -- did you distribute the document? Oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just thinking about it.
I'm not going to spread it.
Okay, wait a minute.
"Did we spread it?" he added, imitating the senator.
As late as July, Feinstein received a letter from Ford alleging Kavanaugh, and earlier in September, it was circulated, but Feinstein denied that his office had circulated it.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't spread his story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep it a secret, and I did.
But his denial was not to the president's liking, who commented on the race Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a very unsuccessful display of body language".
It may not have spread, but I've never seen a body language so unsuccessful.
In continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using those claims for their own ends.
They are willing to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the violence, they don't care who they hurt, who they pass through to gain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars took a rematch of their Elite League defeat on Friday, winning 5-3 in a replay on Saturday.
The Giants had a two-goal lead with the strikes of Patrick Douyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied the score, after which Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard tied the score for Dundee, then Lucas Lanwald Nielsen's goals secured the win for them.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who had been promoted to the top flight and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Douaier's first goal came in the 3:35 minute from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford, and Bouvière doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the first period, Sullivan changed the course of the game for the home team at 13:10 and then at 15:16 with the help of Matt Marquardt, Crowne tied the score.
Due to Dwyer's luck, the Giants were lucky in that he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The owners regrouped and Bouchard again equalised their score with a majority lead with a goal scored at 27:37.
Crown and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen secure his first lead for Dundee at the end of the second period, and he did everything he could to get his team to win in the fifth inning of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are back home in Milton Keynes, preparing for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies while rescuing hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed a hero after making every effort to get a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing, after a powerful earthquake on the island of Sulawesi triggered a tsunami.
The area is still experiencing severe aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
Twenty-one-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agung refused to leave his post in the shaking control tower of the Mutiara Si's Al-Jufri airport in Palu, despite his colleagues fleeing.
He remained in his position and did everything possible to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
According to ABC News Australia, Johannes Siret, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Navigation Authority, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Baliqpapa to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we learned about it", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities believe the death toll could be in the thousands, and the country's Disaster Management Agency reports that access to Donggala, Siji and Butong is restricted.
The death toll could rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and some cannot be extracted, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Ngroho.
The six-meter-high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-dogs are being robbed everywhere.
Yan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The International Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll encounter there".
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palo and told the country's armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete any evacuation task.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Lombok, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crashed in the bay.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in the Micronesia strait now says one person is missing. Earlier, it reported that all 47 passengers and crew on board had been successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that one man was missing as of midday Saturday.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more details about the passenger (race or nationality).
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members after a plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Truck Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the bay, not far from the runway.
Some miners think the plane has gone off the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane landed too low.
"That's a very good thing", said Janice.
Janes said that he and the others managed to get to the emergency exit of the sinking plane by the water.
He said that the dispatchers were screaming in panic, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors repairing the nearby harbor also assisted in rescue efforts, taking people ashore in a paddle boat before the ship sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the diary of the night of the woman's murder.
On Saturday, the court reopened the trial of a man who burned a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett said he received location information from several cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was next to Chambers's phone at the time Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified from the witness stand that he was not in town that day.
When the DA asked if Tallis was telling the truth about spending the night in a Sanford truck, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Telles said he knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted her phone from her text messages, phone calls, and contact information.
"He's erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be transferred to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Consciousness?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of this style of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messaging and solving social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York City lawyer sues a couple for firing him after a racist message
A New York City prosecutor is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from the wrong address saying he was another black man.
The husbands deny being racist and compare the lawsuit to bankruptcy.
Lynce Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was alarmed to learn that the children's new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she first came on the job in 2016.
"You are a love", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing his mistake, an uncomfortable Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying their current maid, who is African-American, had done a bad job and that he was waiting for a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home by Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple for damages for their dismissal and is seeking $350 compensation for each day of the six months he was hired to live in the workplace, even though he was not under contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism against them by saying that it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared that they would not be able to trust him after they had hurt him.
My wife sent him something she wasn't going to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people, Joel Plasco told The Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn.
Stop it.
Comparing the lawsuit to a bankruptcy, Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
And you're going after someone like that?
"That's not a good thing", added the investment banker.
While the case is still pending, the court of public opinion has been quick to criticize the husbands on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not catch the talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Yankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine you replacing someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know today what we know about Paddington's tremendous success.
Saying that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book about the little bear, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had caused mixed feelings after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom he considers an important member of the family, he added that his father was quietly proud of his potential success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a boastful person", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a child who has accomplished something, you're proud of it, even though it's not really what you did.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success in some ways.
Although it was his own creation and his own imagination, he had a habit of paying tribute to Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after the accident, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors were digging for blood to save her life.
"Ned kept calling to say that things were really bad, that she couldn't get over it", said Mrs. Edna-Lapéroux.
Then I got a call from Ned, who said he was going to die in a few minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said to Tash, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to keep his heart working were slowly losing their potency and leaving his body.
He died a while before that, and that was the end of it.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that this wasn't going to work out.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep my head together.
Finally, Miss Edna LaPerreuse, who had been grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, forgetting the ordeal she had been through.
"No one knows", he said.
I hung my head and I was crying the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt an overwhelming sense of empathy for Ned.
She needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The women who were mourning wrote open letters to prevent suicides on the bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreys were writing open letters on the Welsh Bridge with encouraging calls and phone numbers that people could call for help.
Miss Davis's son Taylor was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lynden, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious laugh.
Everyone recognized him by his laugh.
They always said that his smile lit the room.
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a very dark place in New York.
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 at the time, found himself after his brother committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid that it's going to be devastating".
Miss Davis made the postcards to let people know that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be silent, you need to talk.
Miss Humphreys, a longtime friend of Miss Davis, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything like that, he said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
She was in a terrible state at Christmas, when the children opened their presents, she didn't look them in the eye, etc.
She said that her death was a huge shock to them, but they had to deal with it.
It just destroys us.
But we all have to stand up and fight.

Brad Kevin's fate hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think if we could really find what he wanted, the intelligence has a limited time, a limited scope, we could reach unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was being divided under military-style restrictions.
Why would Mr. Kevinah and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their only complaint is about time.
With only five weeks to go until the midterm elections, which are November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans fail, their attempts to elect any of their own to the nation's highest court will be significantly diminished.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kevin, who worked for Bush at the White House, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is filed?
There's going to be a Senate election, where 51 percent are Republicans and 49 percent are Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kevinah will be able to get 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to get a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean lawlessness has declined under Kim.
North Korea's crime rate has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the North Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing information from the Northern United Ministry, said there were 1,127 violations last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter controls on the North Korean-Chinese border and higher tariffs on smugglers were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of outlaws from the North eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the well-defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them home.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate a nuclear ceasefire.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-hee accused the US sanctions of being less successful since they were first implemented.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in these circumstances, it is not possible to unilaterally declare a ceasefire", Mr. Rein said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brad Kevin "hysterical", saying he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brad Kevinah "hysterical" and said he was not morally fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those comments during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acts like that, she's called a hysteric", Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kevin's testimony.
Kevin emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blaise Ford when they were both young.
In his opening remarks, Kevin was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and shouting, when he talked about his family and his school years.
He also blamed the Republicans in the committee, calling the accusations against him "ridiculous nonsense" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he thinks Kevin's testimony proves he can't serve on the Supreme Court because it shows he's against Republicans.
"I think he disqualified himself with his testimony and his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was stunned when asked if he would try to impeach Kevin if his candidacy was approved and if the Democrats had a majority in the House.
"I'll say this, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only in the Supreme Court, he's in the court where he's sitting right now", Pelosi said.
Kevin is now a judge on the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about possible decisions by Kevin Cohen over the Matchell Health Care Act or the Roe Wade controversy, as he is considered a conservative justice.
At his confirmation hearings, Kevin avoided questions about whether he would change the Supreme Court's explicit rulings.
"This is not the time for a hard-line and biased man to go to court and obviously we'll say, 'How wonderful,'" said Pelos.
And a woman has to master that.
It's just a fair criticism, months and years of anger spilling out, and he can't get over it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinman told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, is it?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who said she cries when she's angry, but she developed a trick that involves when she's angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I cry".
I'm mad at you.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "This is great.
Tears are especially permissible to release resentment, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of working in a male-dominated office is one day when I was caught crying in an indescribable rage, and a woman older than me, a cold-blooded manager who I always dreaded a little bit, grabbed my vagina and pushed me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they'll be glad to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with presidential candidate Gary Hart in the campaign.
In 1987, when she was arrested on the Monkey Business ferry with a woman and charged with extramarital affairs, she came home from the race. Deeply disappointed, Mrs. Schroeder thought there was no reason why she should not consider running for office herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision", he told me, laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race, and one more candidate was the last thing they wanted.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, he was behind in terms of fundraising, and he vowed not to get into the fight unless he had $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that his right-handers, who gave him $1,000, were only giving him $250.
"What, they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
When she spoke out about not running for office, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who had supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, anger at the sexism she was fighting.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown", said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling how the press reacted to her.
You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember him wondering what would be written on my headstone.
She was crying.
Like the U.S.-China trade war could benefit China.
The first round of talks on the U.S.-China trade wall were disruptive, and experts say the two countries' struggle could benefit China in the long run.
US President Donald Trump warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, which include solar plants, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, when new tariffs were imposed, affecting $200 million worth of goods - in fact, half of all goods imported from China to the United States were taxed.
Beijing has responded in every instance, most recently by imposing a 5-10% tax on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to respond to the United States in a responsible manner, and the second world war is unlikely to break down anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down would mean demands would be met, but publicly bowing to the United States would be extremely embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing manages to use its cards correctly, US trade pressure could have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"The fact that hasty political decisions in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic deadlock in both countries is actually more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Regress, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security Analysis on Asian affairs.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alam said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, with the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation is more stable and secure", he said.
To restore normal life, the government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorism.
Today, all conditions are in place to ensure the return of refugees to the countries they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'allem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he said it would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the rebellion.
Europe celebrates its victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States team 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The U.S. now has six consecutive losses on the European stage and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title after the senior Danish team Thomas Bjørn scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Nicholson, who struggled for most of the tournament, sent the ball into the water after the third stroke, losing the game to Francesco Molinari in the 16th inning.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all rounds, becoming one of only four players to win 5-0-0 since 1979.
Jordan Spitzer of the United States was eliminated 5-4 by Torbjørn Olsen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player in the European team.
The world's most valuable player, Dustin Johnson, was 2-1 behind England's Poulter, who may have been the last Ryder Cup contender.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the European's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I was able to be useful", said Garcia, excited after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rami, who defeated US golfing legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's individual match.
"I have an incredible sense of pride after defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3.
It's a strange statistic for one of the most famous players to win 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament, the entire U.S. team struggled to find their way through the weekend.
Jim Furyk, the senior USA, speaking after a disappointing game for the team, said: "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we put pressure on the Europeans.
We broke up.
I'm shaking my head in front of Thomas.
He is a brilliant elder.
All 12 of his players did very well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to work with the American Professional Golfers Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their eldest.
You have to be able to deliver value.
We were outmatched.
Red wave update: Concentrations are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reports an overall decline in red wave concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the regional agreement, there are reports of active blooms in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier regions, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The red wave blooms extend about 130 miles (208 km) from the northern Pinellas to the southern outskirts of Lee.
Areas can be found 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but are less common than last week.
The Easter Rising was also a red wave.
Moderate concentrations were observed in or near Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations in coastal areas of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Monticello County and Sarasota and coastal areas, background to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in coastal areas of Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, and Lee counties, respiratory infections are still being reported.
No respiratory infections have been reported in the past week.
