The Prague Stock Exchange is falling down against business closure.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to fix the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily transaction.
The Prague Stock Exchange was linked to Monday's collapse at the beginning of Tuesday's transactions as it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the collapse was on Wall Street.
Also in the Czech Republic, the market’s response to the result of the U.S. House of Representatives’ vote, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
The fall of stocks in Asia
The stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indicators were able to balance some of the losses over the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but could later bet some of the losses, thus decreasing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index.
“The timing for the rescue action in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect the financial markets around the world,” said the head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiation table as soon as possible and approve the draft for a financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries will also be affected by the invasion.
A blood bath of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion) would be spent.
The lawmakers ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. stocks suffered a bloodshed on Monday, and the main stock index recorded the greatest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by 7 percent, a similar collapse it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already dropped before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress approves US government to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on a financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
It is expected to be voted earlier next week.
The U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The members of Congress must discuss some details of the agreement before they can publish the final draft of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
This was said on Sunday by the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank to Reuters.
In the Senate, according to various figures, it is likely that the plan will be voted early on Wednesday.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for the stimulation of the financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "anxiety" due to the complicated mechanisms, how you could help the markets in practice.
The plan must be effective.
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a market stabilization package should look,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He said there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met on Sunday night with the U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
It predicts a purchase of non-sales mortgage assets from the financial companies, which puts the financial companies in serious losses and threatens the stability of the entire system.
“We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective on the market.
We need to continue the health plan further, but I think we are at the goal,” Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Business
The global financial crisis is also striking significantly in the stock markets that decline significantly.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This aimed at calming investors from trading on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a congress decision could affect the trading on Monday.
But it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, and there is also unclear whether the negotiations in the last minute could not yet fail on a problem.
The lawmakers hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will experience some changes.
The total amount intended for the aid for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is intended to be delivered as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, Congress can block the allocation of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations positively
The President has a veto right, but the Congress can vote over his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was based on obtaining finance for the purchase of poor mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
“We have done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and “values the bilateral efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of Golden Fallscreen
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief dealers, said the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a schedule for the financing of the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden scenes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to be subject to the supervision of the fund.
This will be led by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects a help for household owners who have trouble paying back their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for the mortgages it acquires, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to maintain their houses.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know through what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses with each other,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not critical, according to Marek.
“It is much more important that the congressmen agree to support the plan and to say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there is an adoption is the most important at this moment,” Marek said.
Duel on Messers Cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you in your choice.
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
Therefore, it seems, of course, that it is better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons why you should choose a independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Certainly it’s hard to buy a great expensive plate player for home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a quality point of view there is also no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the plate, you’re probably dreaming of at least one such.
This is also simplified with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink-Floyd fan will probably hardly grab headsets for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is broad.
The life of the batteries is also critical.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what the phones can do, they don’t even create in an indicative way.
No modern device can be used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, the phone call and the sims, it can play music and videos, capture both, it has a better, a worse camera, and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of the phones also brings disadvantages with it.
However, the more features you use on your mobile, the more often you will have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy feeders.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, most of which is much less.
In this regard, Music Player (especially the simplest) is significantly more efficient.
Therefore, you should expect at the cheap phones that they can't play more than a few hours of music.
If you’re still calling from time to time, for safety, you’re preferring to buy a charging device for the office – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you won’t have this problem, even the less good keeps at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one-time charging out.
Another problem is when you want to play music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB drive, and no mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers are made without reduction with the small storage cards that are used in the phones.
Players do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players place themselves a music library, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user’s rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, cell phones can be more
When choosing a specific device, you should look at the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course the comfort of operation.
If music is for you most of all, and you can listen to it every day just shortly, for example, on the railroad, then a mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
That almost every mobile phone can do.
You also don’t have to specifically control what music formats a phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and the majority of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and in addition, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already and for itself be a striking argument for why you should use a music handy.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is bad and is mainly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of music sales (whether through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people wear the phone.
If you have the desire to listen to something, go for the phone in the jacket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless free speaking direction with you.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of music will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest cost is usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most people that there are no normal headsets.
The best and technically most advanced phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headsets cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is, in turn, in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of features, the similarity when operating with the earlier normal cassette record or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transfers.
Which device to use now
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But respect.
Basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then use Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Being one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control keys for MP3, and the operating comfort comes up to the one single MP3 player.
The most distant here is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider arrives in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite enriched, the Czech providers offer practically all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Per it will not be allowed to wait for a long time.
That the Czech mobile service providers work among the most expensive in Europe, we have often about it on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which noted that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, it is so likely to come to a paradox situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile service providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are the prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a struggle.
Per it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of much more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are pleased to blame about the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
This is often attributed to the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has often stated in the past that there is no place in the Czech Republic for another provider.
It is likely true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many chances (on the other hand, it is likely that he will hardly find frequencies).
But there is another option – a virtual provider.
The entrance of virtual providers to the mobile market brought a significant price decline, which the classic mobile providers also had to respond to.
Even before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the UK, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
It does not take a long time to look for examples.
In February this we the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just a half year, this provider managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country’s fifth largest provider.
Behind mobilking is the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target audience.
In order to work efficiently, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers typically profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a fairly good chess to put on a non-clicked target.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and to whom they can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It’s hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be found in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer.”
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, the mobile providers say
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
“We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations don’t look very hopeful.
It’s more likely to come to a market entry of mobilking in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for the Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile providers in the Czech Republic are not very pleased with this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to make sure there is no potential competitor.
Your interest in the launch of a virtual mobile service provider has been shown for a long time by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them, we have already achieved negotiating progress,” said Pavel Kaidl, the group’s spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an unbeatable wall of silence.
“At this point we do not assume that there is room for a full-quality virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area,” Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 said in a statement for Mobil.cz.
The specifications of the Czech market are also highlighted by other providers.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds, in rare consistency with O2’s statement: “So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
And she adds: “T-Mobile’s network will hardly show up a virtual provider by the end of the year.
At this point, we need to have a concrete offer to think so short-term.”
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the field of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behavior of the mobile service providers is easy to understand, another provider calls more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also a decline in profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That the providers can pull on a string, when it comes to something, also indicates the long way around the formation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from the time when U:fon came to the market from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is right as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: “The competitive field of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Given the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would pose high demands to the market itself and, above all, its services.”
However, in view of this approach, the mobile service providers are surprised by the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which in the Czech, unfortunately – unlike the UK and other highly developed countries – has no competence to interfere with economic competition.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem with its very typical attitude.
“The entry into the market of a virtual mobile service provider would be possible after a contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider has been concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
Until now, such a contract has not been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic providers,” said Kristián Chalupa from the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations in his response to our request.
The representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
From an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses its position on the market, this is more than questionable.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the abroad where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price decrease in mobile telephone services."
Probably, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price decrease are not the interests of the UOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost already touching consensus of the three mobile service providers, which arises from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is only a coincidence is on the hand.
Just like the absolute same price of gasoline at the gas stations is only a coincidence and the result of a harsh competition.
“The authority has not found any signs indicating an anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore it has no reason to interfere in any way in the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to lack the telecom regulatory authority," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, no one of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you don’t agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the UOHS that three mobile providers are acting similarly.
The complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) indicate that they face very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The dismissal of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the newly adopted Novelle of the Telecommunications Act has failed to extend the competence of ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know this very well, but they probably have other interests.
It can be when no one looks.
In the first place, the functioning of any pseudovirtual providers, of which there are equally several in the Czech mobile networks, remains ignored.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but that are only partly public.
These are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Its own mobile telephone services, for example, offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The lists of prices of these companies usually reach only selected.
The joke of the thing is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit a similarly performed re-sales.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end of cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not happen in the responsibilities of the mobile providers.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such action.
The activities of these companies do not result in overlooking profits, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they will not be affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický notes possible problems: “The law allows such speculations, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they can’t have it fully as the normal customers of the mobile service provider.”
But that alone, at least, should be strange.
Also, another question is opened for the UOHS.
Mobile providers close their eyes to such an action, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It is to add that the ÚOHS has a fairly strong competence to discover such activities, and if it does not want, it does not have to satisfy with the declaration of the providers, they knew nothing about it and their business conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has been emphasized several times, the market entry of virtual providers brought a significant price decline in the various services.
Practically in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical – a too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in the highly developed countries, it is just in these moments that regulatory bodies are struggling to protect the interests of the mobile service providers, but those of their customers.
Whether it was through formal actions or an informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and that followed more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities take the whole case as a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable.
But we don’t throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is true and a virtual provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other stakeholders.
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national hymn Where is my homeland in a holiday hour on the occasion of the Day of the Czech State.
The song was re-played by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in chore and in an instrumental version.
The recording was taken by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the songs are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions immediately.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices that are markant and popular for the solo variants.
“From the beginning, I tried to follow a clear diction with both and then with the chorus, so that you understand the text well, so that a consensus is created,” the director said.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first appeared in 1834 on the stage of the stand theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music originated by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strop of the song was then after the formation of the Czech Republic in 1918 to become an organic component of the national hymn.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What the “new” song sounds?
Prague transport companies will transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport operations as a date on which the first passengers enter a metro, railway or bus, who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper car.
These can now be purchased by about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously play it on their chip card, in the information centers and branches of the transport operations at the metro stations Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are available on the Internet on the website of the transport agencies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the output window in the metro stations, where they have until now had to regularly wait in long serpents on their paper chains.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, which is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
“In these places, a switch with trained staff is also available to the travellers, which advises those interested in online shopping and also plays the coupon on the card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coups can also be played on self-control machines on the Opencard, which are placed in some metro vestibules.
How do these machines look like?
They are red, reminds of tickets, the passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today there are five of them in the city, but it is expected to be eighty until the end of the year," Opatrný added.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic driver instead of the driver
Operating the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just have to introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon is played by itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburb trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of Middle-Böhmen enter the capital.
“In the trains that belong to Prague integrated traffic, the trains accompanyers have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone,” explains Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid the check-in control.
The suburb buses have card readers on the box with the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be displayed to the driver, but the open card must be attached to a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the cupons played.
“Will a passenger check the validity of the played coups, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
A passenger who doesn’t drive by suburban buses and doesn’t know when the voucher’s validity ends can turn to the self-control machines where the vouches are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the device's display.
Sudanese demands a popular decision from the United States
The Sudanese Germans had requested in 1945 that the Böhmerwald be annexed to the United States.
This follows from a letter stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, then at least we want to live under the shadow of the United States of America.
With such a desire, in 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans appealed to the US President.
This follows, among other things, from a letter which has been retained in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the U.S. President in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was adopted on the basis of Hitler's Munich Agreement - to the Czech Republic.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure by the words that the American units will not enter the German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” it says in a letter signed with the words “People to whom the fate of the Sudets lies in the heart.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudet Germans – in knowledge of the Czech national character – to suspect that they would expect brutality, negligence, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protective domination of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
“We can’t believe that without regard to the views of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you’re calling a foreign state to us, which tries to suppress and eradicate minorities and has simply contributed nothing to the victory of the allies,” the letter says.
The reason why the authors can’t sign is allegedly the fear of the “Czech oppressors” races.
If the U.S. President raises doubts about the behavior of the Böhmerwalddeutscher, it would be sufficient to initiate a popular decision in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the U.S. or would want to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, it, according to some witnesses, makes a good picture of the then expectations of the Sudet Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had at least to guess that they would negotiate their expulsion from the Republic, few of them admitted that possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the UK to negotiate for the Sudates a kind of autonomy.
Other people thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was used as a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy.
When he arrived in British prison at the end of the war and he was brought to a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, he had to teach them Czech.
“They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them,” Chalupa said.
No one of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
If you don’t think, then pay.
A emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This can also be characterized by the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport will launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to remove drivers from dangerous behavior behind the trail.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to bring the drivers away from too fast driving and alcohol on the drive.
And they also remember to get off before traveling.
The campaign aims to talk to consciousness, especially to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least to professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also the “blue” slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don’t think, then pay.
The words "Don't Think" are in large letters on a label.
And in a blood laughter the word “pay”.
This means that you can pay a moment of ignorance with your own life.
The spots will shock the viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see very normal images with drastic recordings of accidents victims.
It promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were collected by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and cheese for drivers
“For drivers, the motto is sugar bread and peach.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when driving at Red, they save time.
The threat is the threat of a punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” said the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Hospital Martin Kořán.
And that’s why information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective are, in his opinion, tables that alert the drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surrounding area, and drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has expressed its favour for the return of almost all the territories that were occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if one could conclude peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for this.
This he emphasized in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We have to reach a deal with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territories), because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He understood that a possible return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all doesn't want tractors or bulldozer to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple men and holy and historic places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Departure from the Golan Mountains
Olmert spoke for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the side of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up to get back to the Golan heights.
“They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (chitish) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (chitish) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions after the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a remote bus is not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers are allowed to go and run by bus during the journey.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a stewards is contrary to the road traffic law,” transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident, which last week killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess, was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the bus road.
The young woman was sitting at all unfortunate at that moment next to the driver, on the least secure place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment in which the Steward coffee or newspapers stand out.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with stations according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The remote buses of the Student Agency have no seats; what the company’s director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this first did not agree with the travel movement.
Later this was taken back, and we have reached a consensus that allows travellers to go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation that prohibits the carrier to provide services.
The road traffic law only knows the term vehicle companion; however, its rights and duties do not define it," the Minister's spokesman Hanzelka clearly added.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law covers this issue later.
“It depends on whether the bus has stations in the product license.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are stations and the maximum speed is limited, nearby buses with stations and a higher permitted speed and remote buses without stations with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety jars.
As in the aircraft, the expert says.
BESIP Traffic Safety Expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no basic problem in Stewards’ movement on board a bus.
“In a liquid way of driving there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here is not sure when turbulences will come, and the stewardess can hit the head.”
“But if a bus stops sharply, then the laws of physics, of course, apply.
Just like in a city bus or a railway.
The security of the Stewards must be cleared by the carrier through internal regulations,” he says and also believes that this problem is not fully solved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency is the only bus company that offers Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this position.
The director does not see his job as a risky even after the accident.
“But once I get the impression that Steward’s profession is risky, I’m going to cut it off.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers when entering.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his buses. But his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardessen, but we’re resisting from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he said not a whole year ago to Týden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was disappeared.
The Slovene truck was probably dropped out of the stand strip without blinking and had blocked the bus's drive.
The bus driver tried to escape through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two seats were sold for the Stewards, Jančura denies.
“These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked.”
The company will prosecute truck drivers.
With a compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the judgment, but will also expect a financial compensation from the guilty.
A legislation change?
Not in sight
A more accurate regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring to a legal regulation on which a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
“This is not yet to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones during the journey,” says expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers,” Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of the buses in the competence of the police and labor safety authorities.
Dusseldorfer hopes rest in Frankfurt
In great words, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB board to the staff of the house.
Through the reunification of the units of the Düsseldorfer Monetary Institute with the Frankfurter Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkass Financial Group" could be created, it is said in the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a “competence block” with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a connection could be a decisive incentive to further bonds in the country’s banking sector.
This is how a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the attacked WestLB is still under massive pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which has just recently clarified to the North Rhine-Westphalia Country Government, the time is urgent to find a future solution.
As usual, the connection between the Deka Bank, which is familiar with the deposit customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been spoken for a long time – also on the Frankfurter side.
Although Deka-Bank Chief Franz Waas, when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, said that in a fusion of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which is each half carried by the national banks and the deposit associations, has commissioned the Board to conduct talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, as it is said in the financial field, have just started.
The Deka Bank, which is among the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Square with its 3,000 employees, is not the first time that it is spoken about consolidation in the stock cash sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
There was nothing from this triangle.
As soon as the plans became public, the Hessic state government spoke against Helaba’s participation in it.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has been repeatedly thought games about a connection of the Deka Bank with the Landesbanken.
Last, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba, spoke against plannings about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the awareness seems to be mature that the collapse of the various houses of the public-law sector makes a need.
After the national election in Bavaria has passed, the first thing that can be a connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to further fusion increases, the partners gradually go out of it.
In the south, she would be just a junior partner, although she has so far suffered the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In conjunction with the West LB, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkass and Giroverband, which participates with 85 per cent in the Helaba, has set a rise in the beginning of the year.
It is the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses match each other.
In June, Merl said the decisive question, with which business model the future capacity of the Landesbanken should be secured, has not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is not desirable there.
So it is also in the letter of the board of directors that it will seek a "comprehensive solution" for the house.
How this can bring together individual units with the Deka bank under a hat, will still be shown.
The second spring weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with her as her girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre cover of the Emperor brand, stands a massively built barrier and testifies to the about 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep tones his neck can produce.
Elena gives Luca first a clap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus station next to Puorta Nuova Station, this evening at 23:45 four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival is expected at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing alongside their flag, they have celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long mantle with pelzymat food and a glass with wide silver bulbs, belongs to the buses.
They have been on the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours are alone this year.
Night back, day on the wiesn, at 22.30 pm.
Staying would only mean unnecessary spending, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome drink with Emperor beer, fed to the Bavarian cleanliness order, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses run in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There is no beer or not.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the passengers sleep.
Well, you will need your strength.
It will be held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian signs on Highway 8 just before Munich will take a break again.
When Marcos Group finally arrives scheduled at mid-seventh in the early morning on the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put the yellow cup.
On it is left "Octoberfest", in fractur, next to the internet address of Marcos Travel Bureau: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “When the doors open to the bar, it means running,” Marco calls in the morning.
“Go!” run and occupy the places in the back of the hall.
“Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not all yellow shots on the same banks, in the room!”
The measure, brilliant Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don’t forget about drinking money.
“The security officers show that we are behaving well.
Once you leave the places, they’re gone.”
Third, “Today evening point half eleven again here!”
Now we are going to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as a mark to the trees, to the labels and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
They want to be armed for withdrawal.
It is the second spring weekend, known as "Italian weekend".
There is no accurate information about the numbers; it’s about 50,000 people who go on the way through the Alps and fall into the beer shell, 10 percent of all visitors are expected to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police is strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteer assistants support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians face the British (approximately 60 sets) and the Austrians (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical care.
Particularly popular among the Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, said Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word “relative” and also insists that the German banking sector will not be saved from the crisis-relevant developments.
It has already arrived in the weekend.
The Munich real estate funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to get rid of the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate will only have to pay the share it also takes on.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is the loss of the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has granted money, the state-financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term – which is no longer possible due to market doubts.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to €2.37 million, and its own capital rate was slightly reduced from €1.6 to €1.45 percent.
Current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, the revenue from claims and certain securities subsidies, as well as from the dissolution of deposits in credit transactions, had decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenue from reimbursements of deposited billing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the reimbursement of interests according to the tax regulation and from business care for corporate enterprises, the revenue minus was still moderate with about 16 percent.
The former state-financer, after his privatization in 1990, had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which were then distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because we earned too little in the classic state financing, the Depfa was then increasingly engaged in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make deductions that will have a "significant material effect" on the group's earnings and losses accounting, which is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure funder since Depfa’s acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the loan granting among the banks is largely reversed, as the banks have dropped their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing each year for a part of the Depfa’s credit portfolio – approximately €50 billion.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the funding needs of the group are covered with the loan for a predictable time and the company is “discovered from the influence of the currently largely unfunctionable international monetary markets”.
Other sources say that thanks to the funds the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the monetary markets in the expected time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) are expecting that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and insignificance of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unimaginable that the financing should not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be exhausted.
After the bank’s bankruptcy was still before the bankruptcy late Sunday night, even the at least temporary rescue can’t calm the mood.
The stock price collapsed by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
In contrast, the debt rates are very good.
If the currencies of the priority debt hardly show moving, the rates of the subranging bonds show more clearly.
The interests are mainly affected by the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the expiration periods over 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, then their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which with the acquisition of the Depfa had only taken the crisis into the house.
As long as notary banks, governments and less affected business banks are ready to support the system, a timely withdrawal of pensions can be anticipated.
Or it comes into what now hardly anyone can hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that exceed part-nationalization, the security-limited probability has now become just a legitimate hope.
This should especially prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use a final thread to form a loss report for future tax payments on currency gains in subsequent years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is going to introduce herself on the first day of school at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to cheer: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Before school I had Bammel.
I live on the shore of Tokyo in direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t go away.
The beginning of the lesson seems not as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students start from eight p.m., until twenty to nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lesson began, I was at the time to present myself.
I am not the guy who likes to speak before people, nor before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I attracted an old rock of my host mother, bluse, blue kniestorms, and black leather shoes.
In this elevator I put myself in front of the table and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all swallowed, covered and swallowed and constantly I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew it from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'not useful, sweet'.
So I quickly got to my place.
The girl next to me grew quite broad, she found it an honor that the exchange schoolwoman should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong tune, I was rightly tortured.
Everyone spoke disappointed and choked and asked me for holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all packed out their bentos.
My guest mom had also made me such a lunchbox – that’s something different from the edden German pausenbrote.
I had rice with herbs, small crops, salad of garlic and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumant.
I don’t know what I’m eating in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty placed flames maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which then makes her artistic - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer during the break.
I read it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch it here too.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I have always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga most for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness in tradition, sits and habits.
And that is a great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or sheep flee when it is in danger mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how can we check if they feel the same if they are similar to what we behave?
The internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other state of consciousness without that I or anyone else could prove this so far where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we may at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we turn to other species and cut questions of sensation or in general of consciousness, we enter untouchable fields because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it puts himself dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave similarly to what some scientists conclude to a comparable subjective experience.
I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, the closing circles almost always associated with human consciousness enter the side prefrontal cortex (for its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/controlling functions).
This wide region is much higher developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic character may be in man’s linguistic nature: since so much of his experience is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not deviate from language, it would surely influence it, so animal consciousness, as it may be, is likely very different from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look at other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, not measured or, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research is facing great problems.
Most of my interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is more scientifically accessible.
One could explore the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But with this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one is more focused on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is now about the sensations?
I drive them back to that an emotional system like that is activated by fear in one of its own activity conscious brain.
What we call "fight" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) is demonstrated.
Thus, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and especially the people.
Related to the linguistic nature, subtle disturbances of sensation arise, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from more primitive activities arise in the body sensational regions of the cortex and brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may be fully involved in intergender sensations.
Clearly theoretically, I cannot object to it, but I consider it unproofable.
Pankseep arguments what seems like fear in rats and humans, probably also feels like this in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave the same?
Does a sheep flee in danger, if she also feels fear?
In my opinion, merely behavioral similarity cannot prove experience equality yet.
Nevertheless, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain spots, but sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to man, how would you want to prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, even sheep (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don’t know how to prove that.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from our (as human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is winging here at the neural level, if one measures the same in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think it’s short-looking, but I’m better going forward than walking constantly against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Good term for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or rebuilding of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts hang behind.
The number of EM stadiums may even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at the highest speed now,” Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis said.
“UEFA will keep us constantly in mind.”
A more radical step has been made in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was meeting at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer from it.”

Dennis Quaid is pushing back.
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private - and now has trouble with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete her accomplished Dennis Quaid as a married criminal.
He shame and throws back.
Late Rose War with the ex-wife Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant struggle with each other - in all public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was untrue to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not revealed until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unreliable husband was clear: "Unreliable," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly rejuvenated and refined the story of our relationship."
It is also “unfortunate” that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again “openly reminded of the pain and turmoil that means a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and has recently become the father of twins.
And so concludes his introductions with the side heavier: "My life goes on anyway.
I am glad that I have a wonderful family that goes well.”
Prices for flight tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodations in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper according to a recent study.
Flights and nights in hotels have again become cheaper – this is the result of a study by travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and saw a significant breakthrough in the second quarter after a price rise in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the accommodation in many places has already increased.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
Between April and June, the prices were 3.6 percent lower than last year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
As a reason for this, American Express sees the weak dollar rate, which has led to a "diminating travel interest of American tourists".
Financial locations such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices, with a 26.3 percent rise, even keep the record in Europe.
Also in the flight prices, the trend in the first quarter showed up:
Because of the kerosine taxation, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-range flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices for Economy-Class flight tickets dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, the prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, the prices have even halved.
The reason for the price decline is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the airline market breaks.
On the other hand, the Open Sky Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the U.S. and Europe, raises competitive pressure.
Signs of the stressful situation are the disruption of unprofitable routes by Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 — only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV hits Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein increase breakdown for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher arrived late in the game and failed with a heber to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, and it went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew that he was right.
“We need the second gate,” Hermann Rieger cried in the cabin entrance of the Hamburger Arena.
Much was not going into the catacombs, the half-time break was over and the majority sat back on their places.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the accomplished actors.
His request was also heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol kicked and agreed to raise his finger.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s coach Martin Jol.
His command is similar: here with the gate two!
The implementation remained.
“There was no good thing to look at today,” Marcell Jansen later acknowledged.
Bastian Reinhardt would have “wished more excited.”
The 1:0 (1:0) was due to the Hamburger to Mladen Petric's headball score (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher couldn't hurt the weak Hamburger.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon once, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video valley that showed their club as a class premium.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to arrange it,” said Marcell Jansen.
He assumes that the tabellary intermediate testimony represents more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late commitments – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschützen Petric and the Jansen from FC Bayern – finds itself slow, but it can’t shine yet.
“We need more flair and more dribblings,” Jol said.
After the voting failure
The fear is over on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package made the Dow Jones temporarily break by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in one day in his history.
Then the Dow started again.

The biggest loser at that time was in the Dow American Express, which dropped almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could be added.
Goldman Sachs shares dropped by about 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
The rescue plan will provide the funds for the purchase of so-called false mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid on a hit, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock options of the financial companies, which could be dissolved with the corresponding rate development to reduce the burden on the state cash.
Stock rates in Europe and the U.S. are down

The world’s stock markets went on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion rescue package could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back into the trend.
The Dow lost in the first trading hour 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the U.S. wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on 1 October.

Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Sounds
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused impotence: dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory could not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to the freezing fuel pipes, you are now at risk of cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of spatial satellites where they get additional swing in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, such as the Earth.
Thus, the sonds can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research son Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sun Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised for years, however, is that the body does not behave 100% as expected by the ancient law of gravity.
There are irregularities in the speed.
The sonds are becoming unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory, which describes the attraction of matter through a crumbling of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have created.
"The responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has not been known by space scientists for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction, whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the contrary, is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists, dark matter accounts for a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are released
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists dropped in Egypt will be released again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros.
In a shooting before release, six refugees werely killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The settlement negotiations are already ongoing.
The Germans are constantly in the vision of kidnappers.
World Online describes the most important cases.
European tourists displaced in the Sahara are clearly free.
This was by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian TV show Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are well-being and in safety, the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on the way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting remains unclear before the kidnappers were released: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a refund,” the official said.
It was “only about taking the hostages into reception” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a rescue of €6 million from Germany; the money was to be transferred by the German wife of one of the kidnappers.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" in appeal to a German mediator that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the rescue.
The men should be held as long as the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected a comment on the report.
The abuse of his father "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her father has led to a woman’s murder, a court has.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after alleging eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly infested his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle committed suicide in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had attached her and connected her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a hostel.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was prosecuted for abuse, which had been committed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who was a jealous surfer and cyclist, had been “emotional dead” since 2006 and had “abandoned their lives.”
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by tapping herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I cared for her to fiss and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t force them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “They’re an extremely frightening fetishist and for her victim it must have been scary, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim’s suicide.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended before the court if it had not done that.”
He added: “I take into account the effects, according to the description of Stephen’s father and mother, their action over the years had on their daughter.
Otherwise she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged according to the "Public Security Act".
The man was dismissed by the defence ministry when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were submitted to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the weakest charges within the law and there is no indication of criminal intention.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, “They would have thought that it would be discussed internally with the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause that concerns the secure storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the very sensitive nature of his work in the Common Intelligence Committee.
The documents he moved contained classified reviews about Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought by his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in sight
British housing companies could have a cost of more than £80 million after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 building companies.
Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that companies and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion loan will ultimately be refunded if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are borrowed.
But the interest increased in the meantime is calculated annually to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully ... are now called to take some of the costs of those institutions that were much less careful.
by Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that every company should pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together should pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest rates for the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to earn £81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It’s bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully during the real estate deployment are now called to bear some of the costs by those institutions that were much less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
“We will look at all aspects of this matter over the coming weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potential significant costs.”
The interest rates that will be paid in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, interest rates will be for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since building companies are bilateral organizations without associates, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pences per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the gross market price of its milk by another five pences per liter from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two pence rise in February, and comes after the investigations of a consulting company were carried out.
Retailers should decide whether they want to transfer the price increase to their customers.
Before the price rise in February, the gross market price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former prime minister has been refused to deposit
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a petition of former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused to have kidnapped 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several flushing accusations of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released in early this month against caution.
Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-backed transitional government to give her unlimited freedom first.
The correspondents say that although her weekly appointment was given to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the framework of her release whether she will be able to remain on free foot if she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Scheich Hasina's deposit request because it says she doesn't have to receive any deposit because she's already on a weekly appointment abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a lawsuit against the Supreme Court.”
Their lawyers say they need a deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheich Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government had taken over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all accusations against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations said.
The United Nations has implemented a vaccine program last week in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder thousands of vaccine workers.
BskyB loses complaint in ITV case
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share on the competing ITV.
The competition court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distort competition and enables it to have an unfair influence on the ITV broadcast.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the competition authority that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which motivated the competition committee to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office of Ofcom have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and overwhelming measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in the US Prosecutor's Case
The US Prosecutor General ordered a special mediator to deal with the departure of the nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The reason was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers were suspended for political reasons.
Special interlocutor Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators to hinder justice.
Serious accusations including criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or clarified, General Inspector Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appeal of a special mediator with the authority to force witnesses to declare was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice withdrew nine U.S. prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor wages.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors were not worse than many of their colleagues, which caused many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-level Republican Congressmen, while others refused to investigate the allegations of voting fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are commissioned to investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, General Attorney Alberto Gonzales, has been arrested because of the dismissals and has finally placed his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also dismissed.
The report of the General Inspector criticized the role of Gonzales, in particular, by carrying on the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, giving up his leadership role and showing himself "extraordinary disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former President Bush’s chief adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf will be awarded the Q Award for his epic song "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize during the award next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The chief editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there would be some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part, which lasts almost two minutes.
The song appeared as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s “Bat Out Of Hell” has spent about nine years in the charts and has sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart attacks after he had broken down on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute cervical inflammation.
Later it was known that he had a cyste on his ball.
Obskure street in the city, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main traffic roads, solo roads, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
However, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents it’s hard to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most people have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without access to the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dust road than an active passenger road.
There are also no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street has its fans.
For example, Avalon Bay, a building company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants Extra Place to re-flaster to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other fans include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it’s fascinated by the short road simply because it’s one of the remains of the house block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and responsible for the road, has no interest in retaining them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district official in the municipality council 3.
"Only very little room has remained in the city's possession and we want the Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what Avalon could do, but we also want that public access remains guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street will be refined and seats designed for a cafe to which the company wants to rent room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this falling street and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the building protection department said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the road and emphasized that the department’s task was rather to develop the real estate than to manage it.
Compared to its colourful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place hasined some of its historic impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm, which belonged to Philip Minthorne, was divided among its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is the most known as the hole for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The poster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scratches, lumps and parts of fassers, posters, leaves and wings.
Some inhabitants, including the blogger who writes about the Gentrifying of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare – a practically unchanged divider of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who manages the blog entitled "Jeremia's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Claims: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Disappearing City"), has published a part of the City History Conversation on Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, then wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow baggass that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying through the rainfall."
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly like it recently at one night.
A rat was running through the back of the road, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where today a more expensive clothing store is located.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and a empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of outright newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be somewhat polished.
Fields added that, according to his opinion, some people underestimate the excitement of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and ugly.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, chief academic staff in California Studies and chief director of the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as well as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice."
Talking to the Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentioned that “the likelihood for African-American and Hispanic students to graduate school successfully is lower than for white students” – which is true.
To close this performance gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among others, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who learn English first.
However, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Let’s take the example of “Sixth Street Prep”, a primary school in the east of Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Spanish and come from low-income families.
More than one-third of students, many of whom have just recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93% of children from the fourth school year were well assessed in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those that were preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate any exceptions.
Moreover, the school practices the approach according to which education is conducted in an English-speaking environment. That’s exactly what Obama should consider, says school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in vocational teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had only come from Mexico shortly before.
“It works,” she noticed, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make forecasts about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation targeting "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than neglect and trivialize them.
Oil prices decline due to economic concerns
The oil price has dropped strongly on Monday due to the fears that even the U.S. rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil trading on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shocked both by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and by strong turmoil storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to $90 per barrel this month to then rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors have been worried again on Monday, though Congressmen had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from completed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy up the Wachovia Corporation’s banking.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial corporation Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tension negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears to have failed to revive the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation further deteriorates, the demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus spreads worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have corrected their oil consumption expectations down due to the weak economic growth for the next year, and their oil and gas prices for the year 2009 forecast decreased by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Inner defense Shaun Ellis thought he would have seen everything after he went on more than anyone else in the Jets trichot in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets transformed a unsuccessful game into a triumph race.
“I’ve never seen something like that before,” Ellis said.
After a striking match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to a afternoon where their growing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two touchdowns, one time as an external defense player and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't get very excited," Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played capture, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner off.
External defense Darrelle Revis started a failed curve and turned it into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and started it off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last loss of the ball forced by Bowens was probably the crazy.
The cardinal had conquered the ball with the remaining 10 seconds in the game when the Jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without getting one, Mangini said: "Think me, I the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time.”
Destroyed Destroyed Destroyed its World Record
Haile Burrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him the best long-range runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berliner Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to reach the 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59 he improved his previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Brasselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has at least one world championship title or set a world record on every route from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Burrselassie stopped the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because of fear that afterwards might be exaggerated that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - the precipitation has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since rail runners like Brrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long routes, the record time for the marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Brselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his wave two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Obviously, he has been refreshed after a break and has not returned.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started the training again a week ago and I still had some concerns today, but at the end everything was super.”
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopian rivals from Eastern Africa - that he was excessively orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, too much relying on the racing leaders as if it were a racing race, and putting a world record over the race.
However, this criticism hardly damages the size of breakouts as a long-range runner.
accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, the rainfall had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge the falls after the tempomachers left behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Bruselassie made his last departure from Kwambai, who arrived second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh-speedest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her race gently by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runner first out, but overwhelmed after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya was third at 2:25:01.
The pride and the traps in the life of the black people, in a city of a very special kind.
Hidden between the outskirts of the leisure parks in the surrounding area of Orlando, a few miles from the glowing, loud and giant drive, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of the Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did it in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three cracks, 300 brown houses, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have arrived at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist excursion destination by receiving it to the Florida Guide, which was produced by the federal writer’s project in times of depression – is, in many ways, a place of a very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, bold and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's missing him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many here continue to regret being observed by foreigners.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the city's oldest church.
It must vote.”
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of 2,400 inhabitants, where poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a high-burg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and on the hat.
And so right the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as here everyone calls Hurston.
She presented to the world her hometown in books that came from heart and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, into the scenes of dark history and human drama.
Unlike Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led the reader to the shop of Eatonville to the first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
“From the street to the left,” she wrote, “there is the brown-white modern school, with its careful gardens and playgrounds around which Howard Miller always takes care, although he hardly can read and write.”
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and what-and-all fits to clockrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston then linked Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, wrapped the Hurston by quoting the men singing songs about her beauty, full of sexual appeals.
She added, “Some people didn’t like this.”
Here you still remember Hurtson as a lively excentric who regularly returned after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into the city, she did it mostly without warning, in a noiseful Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that itself today depicts somewhat on her honorable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, but many neglected them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he walked in his chair, on a back-to-back terrace looking at the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was probably buried.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were stolen.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great memorial ceremony, no public lectures in great style.
"I don't think they've understood their contribution to the world or her legacy," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-spur highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-spur main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the Highway 4 through the western city line.
The proposal was submitted as Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mixture brought hatred into the community.
“In that time, a crowd of white boys often came and they threw orange and stuff on the people sitting away,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even one woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston appealed to the Supreme Court’s demand to force integration by describing his decision in Brown’s case against the School Council as “offensive rather than respecting my race.”
Inhabitants say today that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to be hugged – I remember it – they hugged their teachers in the morning and they hugged their teachers in the evening,” says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief executive of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
That could beined so long, she added until teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," Nathiri said.
However, citizens’ rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors and artists who travelled over prejudices as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don’t understand it.”
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made himself on the way to Hurston's unnamed tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly promised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book rails, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The remote road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescue.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what could destroy the district by building the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
“The plans of a five-way highway lived the city, accelerated everything at a high speed, awakened real citizen pride,” Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd expressed it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There came more and more visitors, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has gone here to the church since 1993, and local people began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-stop library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly folded and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos it can sometimes feel like a back gas in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He is now 90 percent black.)
External people looking for the history of Eatonvilles and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, an approval is required in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white and represented by black men at the field work - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a love for dark red, still fear that her hidden community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, a higher degree of domestic stupidity was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and busy, foolish and mixed as any other race and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's grandfather, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police, who may say he needs some help.
And even the younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
“Most people who just pass here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’ Alondra Kenon said on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at your history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
In New York, we are talking about fluent financial latein.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the massive TV screens on the Times Square, they’t realize that they’re in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror work day since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal teas with loud clapters along the garbage and carrying tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slurry around between apartments as human packaging animals load with around the 50 packed t-shirts hanging on a joch-like stange on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for their breakfast bag on the food stores in the city and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a week day between 16 and 19 p.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account because of all the world’s end.
Although I decided to put my duty on time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already slaughtered.
Not to the money switch to withdraw or deposit money, but to the customer service switch where primary customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the Macy's shop and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I was a serpent.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they pended, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had removed money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to a building parks), co-operative banks and those local parks that only have shares in one state and say they treat their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy management over and when the last Friday New Yorkers went home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings of $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of a further collapse, the office and shop employees who stood before me brought their bares to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Almost normal New Yorker people have gained a fluid financial rate in the past few weeks.
A woman who called in my Chinese tribal supermarket took with so much confidence reference to Lehman Brothers, the bank broke out and their disguised executive director, Dick Fuld, as if she was stumbling over a foolish colleague.
And Lyn, which is about the 50-year-old uniformed Concierge of my housing block, has come from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I’ve changed, I don’t take any risk anymore.”
Muslim tombs damaged during right-wing strike in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, scattered with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of buriing a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend on which the extreme right-wing parties significant profits in the country’s parliamentary election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 tombs at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were seriously damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The assassins sparked Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the tombs, but criminal officials consider this a attempt to hide the motivation of the extremists driven by hate to Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "heavily shocked" about the news of the grave abuse that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience investigation is ongoing in Austria after the country dropped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties which obtained 30% of the votes, took part in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their election claims were criticized by opponents as alien hostile.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated for a ban on headaches and burkas and even announced his hatred for foods that are generally linked to Islam.
During his last protest in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election and indicating that the extreme right are the strongest political block in the country suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, was prohibited from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges set Glitter a six-month suspension after he informed the authorities that he intended to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was given it last Thursday to impose a foreign travel ban after it presented evidence to the judges for Glitter's prejudice for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police requested at the Ashford Court permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travel abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.”
As required by the register of sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesman for Kent's police unit said: "Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
“In our opinion, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual criminals in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel good and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through the passports and he flew someway to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he would return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived on August 22 at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to be able to demand that he register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter was previously imprisoned for four months in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calm and pleased that Glitter was stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
‘I receive the master behind the stage to keep his character,’ Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no clothes, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
Artists on the one hand
On the other hand personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find the characteristic gestures, the depths of a stolen look or the expression of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his 'Flamenco-people' project, the German photographer Günter Bauer presents the varied theatralik of some scenes on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco decoration on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflect the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day,” explains the artist and makes clear that ‘Flamenco people’ can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the spectator realizes that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
Almost normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to transmit passion, sadness, joy on the stage and thus move the audience.
To be able to capture the personality of these artists, you don’t need to take pictures on the stage.
Your personality and character are in your heart.
What interested me was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco champions with the camera.”
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', took a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images that remind classic photography were created.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing, or the instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who with his art deceives the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the fixed purpose of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the Gallery of the El Fotómata.
Famous figures in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an Anthology of the Flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to regain this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of the sport' ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts of the ‘Flamenco-people’ project are different, the photographer says that I like to photograph people, to meet them, and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, portrait is the most difficult breed.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to be able to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of the portraits of today’s Flamenco with the title ‘Flamenco-people’ is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and goes parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the Roma he is just writing is ‘a greatness’.
He still doesn’t know where the novel’s action takes place and what it’s about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project on which he is currently working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel prize winner admitted that the project he deals with is 'a greatness' and 'all indicates that he doesn't have to write the novel'.
‘If I had thought I’t have done it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish the novel at some point,’ so he ended his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most excellent characters at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival Festival and to whom the majority of visitors give their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience in front of him that noticed that the Peruvian, who possesses a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his appeal to literature emerged from ‘extraordinary adventure passion’, from ‘rejoice in reading’ and from ‘will experience more than before’; how he writes and keeps ‘discipline’ to supplement ‘the lack of inspiration’, his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he does; how Faulkner, Víctor and Alejandro Dumas’ vocational influence and what the basics for his stories are.
The Spanish-American novel writer insisted that there is ‘no way’ to measure and how to know whether books change life, ‘but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeful experience’, Vargas Llosa, who claims that it ‘produces effects’ and ‘make the people even more apart’, therefore I ask the writers ‘do not leave their lightness’ and ‘assume responsibility’ for his call.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather didn’t play with: Birds fought partially out.
After the announced puppy fighters found that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the puppy battle feast, with which the party was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the Stierkampfest.
Thus the celebration was exposed to the unstable weather, so two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned battle feast could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the Stierkampfarena.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who split three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
The same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bear, which had succeeded him more through galoping than through his bear fighting art.
And worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he had so badly fought, a majority of the audience responded in his second battle with Buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape from the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilograms of hashish.
Tomorrow: 5 minutes before 10.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the driver to stop, after which they escaped.
It seemed like they should not stop carrying more than two thousand kilograms of haschish.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A. A. J., as the Basque State’s Interior Ministry.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
Police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the border strip. At the moment the drivers got out of the car to escape through a land road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza eventually caught one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers carried 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which was captured by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with haschish bundles, which were later directed for accurate laboratory analysis and the bundles to other police offices.
Furthermore, the officials found that the label was ‘double’ so it did not match the label indicated in the vehicle papers, and therefore a further arrest was made for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continues the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the drugs captured.
The detained 28-year-old A. A. J. was brought to a police office for interrogation and will be presented to the prisoner in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness has watched her trying to get out of her park in Montecito in a rather strange way, California traffic police spokesman told the magazine People.
The witness stated in detail that Locklear 'after 16:30 a.m. penetrated the gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lot, and when she drove back, she found herself on her sun glasses a few times.'
A little later the witness, who at first the actress probably had not realized that Locklear stood on a nearby street and went out of the car.
The witness was the person who warned the emergency service because she had 'fear of Locklears' living.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood around the street and thus blocked the traffic.
‘They seemed unoriented,’ so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcohol enjoyment was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of officials followed, we believe that Locklear stood under the influence of an unknown drug', the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an undefined substance that could not be identified and brought to a local investigation detention around 19 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arizona after a treatment, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Union of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, today has assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had withdrawn last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
‘In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who will have to take responsibility for it,’ Llamazares pointed out what action the party must have against the one who so far sits as council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of the violations that Silva might have begun: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency.’
With regard to this topic, he emphasized that education has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci represents in 'Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to ‘represent a lot of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired by the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the actors.
'Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later on the telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós literature, assures that thanks to this drawing work his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. This is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who ordered him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial for the second century celebration on 2 November in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, provided by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, provides Garci, as he added, the ‘one-time opportunity’ with the help of decorations and corresponding clothes to represent the image of ‘ confused Spain, which sought the false leader for the struggle because the people had been brought back through the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII’.
However, the Cineast regrets that you could not count on the financing such as at ‘Alatriste’ or ‘Los fantasmas de Goya’ (two times as high as at ‘Sangre de mayo’), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career, could not be directed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', contributed through his usual way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you have to try first before you begin to turn and for those who didn't cast, he appeared 'disgraceful' and respectful, 'a part of the film director's profession is to provide help in the theater and the cinema to know what's going on in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates that represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', neither 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally neither the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the succession, later you realize that it’s just for gifts, and now you’re happy if you’ve produced a movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón calls the memory back to the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honors a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and stood for the abolition of the korset that restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this role, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We’re not trying to tell about her life, but to keep her spirit,” the flamenco dancer said.
Your dance foundations helped me a lot in Flamenco.
“The dance of the butterfly” came to me like Guajira, or “the dance of the serpent” like tango.
Her dance was sensitive and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she says.
The screenplay is expected to have two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of their performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The performance also counts with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he ‘accepts the role of the accompanying of the artists who were Divas, to which he always falls in love.’
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in so far located places such as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she’s one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works today no one more and therefore even less to appreciate,” says Bayón.
The show will take place at 20:30 in the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008).
Thus the ‘Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón’ is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the tour exhibition ‘Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz’, which was opened in May and, after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso.
The United States could be bad without Paul Newman.
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with her in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then ruling show of the American cinema, which was laid down, from all over America to Newman, with her enthusiastic show and followed her.
Let’s see what it costs to give him the Oscar.
When he returned in 2007.
He knew he was very sick.
However, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford crying, “my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.”
No one was afraid to laugh or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of the cinema and of the Fatherland, he has died in a sad moment where the fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market runs, where the humbled self-esteem of the Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, then you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he was almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as many losses as well as profits: from the foundation that dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died from overdose, to his own brand of home-made and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country where it cost him a lot of effort to stand up against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of surprising hits home-hock over Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man has died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
‘We’ve left the greatest of us all,’ confirmed George Clooney, one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman lived: obtaining high demands of legality, a responsible private life, leading far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone trying it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were many possibilities not to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a filet at home?’ he often laughed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“From all the great roles he played, no one he was as proud as those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive pope, and those of the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are short.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘ Are we prepared for that?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it’s not true!
It was called the perfect road, and according to my assessment, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, that’s a lot of foolish, if you would observe the assessment and I could examine it, such thing would clearly not have passed through.
But we go through everything from the beginning.
The foolish begins with the ticket hole that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem to be bad for me, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including the chip to avoid the stays on the road).
So not.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first foolishness that is to go there only for this reason) and (after an infinite waiting slope) there is the surprise! the T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second foolishness because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material?
So good, things like these are a little compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a wait slope of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road began and we didn’t let our backpacks lie in front of it, even if it once managed, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
Furthermore, in these 40 minutes of waiting time it seemed to rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a mass rebellion and to overthrow the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will surely have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I’ve got, I can already think that the output was wrongly drawn up.
Of course, if you were asking me for a perfect road, this road would never imagine me.
So I think we will still long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the ‘Emerging Technology Conference’, organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a route planner to move on the campus of the company).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this ‘receiver’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also arrange the present after the discussions into the groups.
In the presentation video 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that speaks with her, and that he is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will soon hear.
All without the blue screenshot
impressive
That is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, we were very superficially talking about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many built-in programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a determination, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and 'extra' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it.
Microsoft has the right, the operating system gradually loses its meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared on the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
A lot of people say that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling something to his grandmother.
that is true.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only launched to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrom and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What does half of the applications on the computer use?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without any doubt. I bring a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing drink machine is a sign attached: `Your search. Our future'. It printes a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola.
When we begin to count the countless star appearances, we can take back to the image of a very powerful man, with a top bar who had raised heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, poor and tailled.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the departure of the name is associated with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' overwhelms everyone because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and characterizes itself by a small Belgian flag (acceptable) that these t-shirts have as detail on the neck cut.
And respect, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigan and kaschmire, cotton pants, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Comfortable and modeled underwear.
However, it is very sad to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister, did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is charming, but full of life joy.
Currently, the Brothers Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moving her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion that is sponsored by the Spanish Fashion House.
Mercy and scary, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I’ve come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I’ve visited the presentation of the second edition of ‘Mango Fashion Awards’ and took part in the Dinner on Valentino’s Honor.
A very intense working time that is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinemas of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women, how they’re dressed, how they combine their clothes, that’s what I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, but ultimately, everything meets in one and these areas have many common things.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to walk around in the clothes of my grandmother and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers so much like to have our own style in classroom and in the samples to look in the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move yourself into the real actress role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect to the costume designer and their professionalism.
You’ve been 30 years old, you’ve not fallen into a crisis?
Oh what.
I feel better than ever when I was thirty.
I find that the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was small and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you’re thinking about becoming a mother, right?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother, because that is what my body requires, and in addition I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
When it comes to film art, you keep in mind the works you participated in and were directed last year.
That’s exactly what it is, and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and nervous and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I wish 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' were listed for the first time.
Let’s see how they like you.
A couple of days ago you appeared on the race with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don’t say something like that.
It’s not that I went on the run-up to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a while, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothes from our collection were auctioned for Mango to gather the money for Naomis NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they’re not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which you are involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handset, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may be reclaimed due to the alcohol level will have to install the ‘Alcolock’.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level installs this system in his car, which prohibits him to start the car in a drunk state.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the General State Prosecutor's Office.They say it is a pilot project that will take a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who have been shown more than once because of driving under alcohol influence have returned to drive.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents the start of the car when the driver has done the alcohol test; or when a alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs will be borne by the one who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices already in the first year after its introduction prevent up to 65% of violations.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to interfere with this behavior before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be achieved in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
Still, the device is on the Spanish markets, not available in any store, although it has already been built-in in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Exactly tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British timeline, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez de México Airport DF, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed, with the Prince and Princess of Asturia traveling.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a sunshine to see the royal couple coming out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours ago I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people to the airport at this timeIt's from hereor so
No, she is the Spanish woman, but she has lived here a couple of years.
So so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturia are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Navy soldiers who give the honorary salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-wrapped hair, without ordinary 'peep-toes', was told her that there is an storm in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers waiting for the official follow-up.
At the door of the hotel where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter who loves to make jokes awaits them.
The Best Premium of Fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially excellent fashion designers and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the ‘El Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards’ fashion competition to promote and increase young fashion talents internationally.
This is awarded with a cash price of €300,000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the view window of the Mango Filials on Boulevard Haussmann No. 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company’s second-largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair in the contest. Everything ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother recently died, broke down. He pulled the dress from the fashion house and brought some jewellery from ELAH that were stunning. He stood at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was so a Kavalier, so he ended with the Baron of the Red Shield without jackets, because jackets borrowed them to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz has rushed to the business and had a pants and a t-shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got in excitement, remembered the old times, hit a strip and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, she did not join the walk through the palace rooms, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always raises a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bedwear and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had asked in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starful sky of Paris.
Oh la la, so is life.
1001 Tips for Stress
There’s not 1000, but a way more to forget chaotic us fast everyday life.
And even if it’s few, they’re all gathered in a book in which it’s how to get to relax.
The waker is a punishment when he sounds at 7 a.m., but even worse appears the idea of returning to the hectic rhythm that the current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one and no two methods to combat daily fatigue and the problems of how to disable from the work world.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 ways to relax' and so the rest that the book provides comes into the bookshops by the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever thinks it is impossible to peace in areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such a belief.
In addition, the methods are offered to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body’s balance and stress has become a problem, then it’s time to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder, which is called speech in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you has been told that you’ve talked at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no one reason that causes this appearance.
Often, connections with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as night dreams, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (night sleep), speech in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a slightly investigated phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in a single word, flirting, or it can be quite the opposite (writing, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and occurs in this way.
We’ve said it’s a positive disorder, so it’s not treated whether it’s associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to irritate the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are horrible and a little too wild.
In nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be applied to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs once in sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing about what has happened.
useful advice
Do not wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will break it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears scary after a couple of phenomena, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what the reason the child has for the fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child is not under pressure to perform a hearing and get more information out.
So you will not be able to anything, because when the child is sleeping, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that takes just a few minutes.
The illusions... finally
After a long thirst course, Illhäusern on the playground is finally back on a success course.
Without a lot of effort, the Yellow-Black played numerous torch opportunities and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this meeting, in which the attackers had the effort to show their abilities, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was just passing the corner, the illusers should easily dominate the game, and it successfully managed to challenge the defense of Denmark first with a remote shot, then the brain with a high pass, and the roman with a shot with the footpiece.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the vibrant Riahi on the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half time should be crucial with first two torch chances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the illhouse by Marais, who was exactly right to take a ball back, which was defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the illhusian torchguard should not be able to enjoy his fortune for a long time and will be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, thus his team colleagues had to continue to play numerously lower.
However, Denmark didn’t know how to exploit this and did not face any big problems to an illhaeus elf who just retreated a little to ‘tighten’ their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball after a great trouble passed very close to the latte.
Sarkozy is meeting with angry fishermen
Before he is flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a breakthrough in Britain.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who on Monday blocked the arrivals to several Breton and Normandy ports, the French President decided to meet on Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive mind’, and hoped that he will come with ‘concrete proposals’.
The President’s visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, which was established by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in light of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which reached a record value of an average over 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and wages of the seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they launched protests in Morbihan and Calvado, causing the stays of ten kilometers long.
Quiberon's seafood was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Peninsula of Quiberon was bound by a blockade.
On Monday, the seafarers expressed their determination by burning tires and palettes from the early morning before the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Armel Canal, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing courts didn't go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuver of the trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved the blockade of the significant total raffinery in Donges on the evening.
The members of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the planned discussion at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen don’t want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
‘The strike will continue,’ because ‘the fishermen will not be abandoned at any point’ and ‘they don’t want to go to Paris,’ said Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Fishing Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think the profitability limit of a boat can only be achieved with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor of 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the effects of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects to deliver 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
Until now, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider to pay out more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday Financial Times, the insurance company American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering to transfer more than 15% of its assets to refund the $85 billion that had been deposited in advance.
AIG is ready to promote the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement insurance in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
Among the assets from which AIG might be separated are its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the reinsurance Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and its investments in the Private Equity.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to refund the loans of more than 85 billion dollars granted by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will lose the same amount.
Historical Paris Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historic fall of the rates: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a failed loss of approximately 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in his history (684,81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline after the terrorist attacks on 11 September.
According to the final output numbers, the Nasdag index, mainly technology-related, has fallen by 199,61 points to 1,983,73 and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8,81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the House of Representatives, which should restore some stability on the markets, the Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 for, the MPs denied the funds he had requested to finance secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
“There’s a bad picture that makes Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in a few days will come ‘too late’.
“If the project is indeed condemned to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank) and other central banks to get the crisis in control, which would further limit the credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency even more, ‘that every day that passes, the ruin of a financial enterprise’ in the United States ‘connects’.
After Washington Mutual failed on Friday, U.S. authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia’s banking transactions by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly and led to emergency measures in favor of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing ‘not only an American but a global crisis’, the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The income of the state fund within ten years fell from 3,632% on Friday evening to 3,827%, and the income within 30 years last night from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama wins after points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two White House candidates on Friday followed another to find out who came out as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs to elect both the Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which should be traced by one-third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, though quite remarkable, was not ‘brilliant’ enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election surveys five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion survey on Saturday that says Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the voters still undefined, that is, those to whom it comes now, Obama appeared as the winner with 39% of the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts, but this weekend Bill Clinton warned.
The seventh-year-old McCain did not cease to put his uncontroversial experience in the field of foreign policy in the forefront, highlighting very clearly the ‘naivity’ of his opponent with regard to those questions that were the center of this first television duel.
‘Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...’, he emphasized several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been predicted since yesterday in the Republican election spots.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without leaving himself out of the version.
He put his ability in the forefront to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain has not yet understood, but Obama has already,” a democratic election spotted this weekend, accusing the Republicans of not having captured the full extent of the crisis that ‘American from the Street’ burns.
“Thro the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama appealed yesterday to 20,000 people who had gathered in the rain on a North Carolina election event.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘middle-state’ or ‘workers’. ‘The financial crisis brings Obama, who Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the threshold, a clear advantage.
“The next week could be a decisive turning point,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is ‘the final judgment of a eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain’.
After he once again emphasized that he would probably even manage to lower the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, are for him the highest priority.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates deliberately discussed the questions on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was approved by Congress yesterday night and is extremely unpopular among the people.
“Have you noticed that a election was held in Minsk?”
Youth and opposition protested on Sunday evening on the main square of the White Russian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred White Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the electoral premises on the Minsk Market Square to protest the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result has yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukashenko’s power: ‘The dictator must withdraw.’
Some acknowledge that they have not voted at all: ‘What is it useful if they do with my voice what they want,’ says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of visas to 40 leading White-Russian persons and the deposit of certain assets, could be repealed if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census,” said Juri Potemkin, a press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, for a heterogeneous assembly of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and for us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter the parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because ‘the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
For when our economy, which has a strong debt to Russia, falls into a crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She emphasizes that the voting numbers appear to be too high, and that the extension of the voting in advance (26% of the Minsk voters) has opened the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Are you noticing that a election took place?”, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in the parliament, and those that are most likely to match the government’s ideas.
The silence of the night falls again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
From the blood that was back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the confidence of the public, which was severely shocked by the polluted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross’s blood donation service were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Given this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada in February 1994 launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drawing out guidelines to prevent a re-catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still delighted to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee aimed at developing a new system for the management of blood conserve in Canada.
In Quebec, the Committee of Gélineau fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
'1998, when Hema-Quebec started their work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was disturbing.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood conserve and through the work on this area over the following years, we have gained the trust of the public,” she says, before she proudly emphasizes that at the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec had trust in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary keeps in mind that ‘confidence is something extremely fragile’.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting according to the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of human form of cattle disgrace in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been leading since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So let’s rely on one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which one applies exclusive measures if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as it is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was without any doubt proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the Nucleic Acid Tests (NSTs), which allow it to prove the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it was in the previously used tests.
The NSTs enabled it to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time at which the person was infected and when the first viruses can be demonstrated in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood conserve should be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conserve each year, it would take more than 24 years to get a case in which HIV was transmitted through a blood conserve.
I think you can feel comfortable today when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore your health,” said Hema-Quebec’s chief executive.
‘Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We have to monitor continuously,” continues Dr. Décary before he emphasizes that Hema-Quebec has to provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
The demand is rising because the population is aging.
Since the treatments for the fight against cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or plaques.
The population aging also affects the blood donor network, which is an average of only 3% of the people in Quebec who are suitable for blood donation.
In this case, any healthy person who is 18 years old or older and meets the qualification criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who give their blood are not accepted because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
With this 3% we can get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The lack of reserves is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donation network as they get older and no longer can donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
“Life is so busy today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” Francine Decary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood conserve but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart clots, eyebrows and skin, which are almost exclusively used in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are intermittently stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cloud blood bank in Quebec.
In the navel cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousand blood samples, and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
‘We should probably start providing it for transplants at the beginning of the next year,’ says Dr. Décary, who describes this program of nubular blood loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they don't have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the Half-Final
Montreals Impact has qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all the gates) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total gate ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the USL's first league departure games.
The midfield player Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a goal for both the one and the other side, midfield players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the formation Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one to put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the pre-and-return series on Friday, Impact had brought the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattles a 2 to 1 downtime.
In the semi-final, Impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compare a 3 to 1 deficit with a 4 to 3 victory in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps moved to the semi-final with a total port ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Shortly - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two patterns and Kovalev converted a pass in this win game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the whole shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians warned.
I need a game so I can feel good.”
“He’s fixed too much on it in the first half,” Guy Carbonneau noted.
I think he liked the end of the game.
He received tremendous pleasure.”
Charest is on the north.
The Prime Minister does not exclude to start elections before the end of the year.
Once the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) tries to be elected in today’s parliamentary election.
This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, fulfilling the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of image mole was projected behind him.
On three huge screens turned spectacular images of water power plants, mines, from Quebec viewed in 'Google Maps', land maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the prime minister, by the way, refused to exclude that he will hold the elections this autumn, even though he said that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic space' that presupposes an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th width - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited to explaining why the north is 'a jewel with huge potential', but not stating any date, any investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At least some views on what could be done more: mainly in the water energy, forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of the emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north possesses ‘nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds’.
This 'region twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just close to us, it’s within us,” he emphasized, as to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national founder dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection to the north, he emphasized: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s our own, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, covers a part of Labrador with what Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
“There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is available, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,” he said.
Moreover, ‘with climate change we have to re-think our vision of the north,’ he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be carried out throughout the year due to the ice mixture.
In the face of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekinese deputy of Ungava) have already launched consultations with about thirty communities.
A ministry committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Treasures) takes an important place, has started the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity ‘to create a common vision’.
On the other hand, the development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan North will be ‘debated, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘Vision’ as if it was a continuation of those of the liberal Prime Minister who were in office before him.
“As the liberals who were in office before us, we have re-thought to transform the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This, by the way, was one of the repeated topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of taking over the party’s leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions proposes to convert the power plant of Beauharnois into Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, from Reading, who reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
He referred to the press to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Water Power Staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest emphasizes that its launch is planned for 2012.
“It remains among us, but I am going to be there,” he trusted his members of the party, which was the result of those pleasant storms.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and in 2009, in fact has not yet excluded the possibility of holding a election this autumn, which is possible for him by the law.
He emphasizes that his calendar, however, is full, mainly due to a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially ‘the objectives concerning the Constitution’, which were promptly adopted: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the ‘speciality of Quebec’ in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Television, and that they have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were accepted with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the development policy of the North-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, ‘we’d be far further today,’ Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its favour to support the government’s adoption of a North plan.
“But what we want is that this will not be just a big idea,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation of Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.

Mr. Vic Toews, the former 'Justice' minister (which is irony) in the Harper Cabinet was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover so shame, says just as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only one of all the affected countries, has not brought home its citizen captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that were accused of happening to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to vegetate there under unhuman conditions.
The only one that falls into a judicial parody to assess the accused’s guilt.
Let’s remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers promise to bring Omar Khadr home in order for him to get a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes of torture: it doesn’t interest them that a young adult after so many years of torture will surely be spiritually broken forever.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are just experiencing a tightened cutting of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag, and that sounds so unthinking from his mouth.
Therefore, the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and blocked, all according to the goods of a government leader who is supported by only the minority (will he be part of the minority after October 14).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they don’t see that this government has dismissed itself from what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this discouragement, and none else.
The Orwell Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and follows an Orwell logic that the world’s largest gold-winning company has sought an over six million fraud against three authors and a small medium-free publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unpartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially not in the case of fraud, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dare to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defence and fight with very unparalleled weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost irresistible pockets of the gold coin.
The tactic of these unparalleled struggles is, in the rest, often to ruin the defenders to force a consensual arrangement that makes the opposite mourning and, in addition, frightenes anyone who dare to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her view of things before the public opinion.
Unlike what is going and going in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada discussions are normally carried out by the exchange of ideas and not by butterflies.
So it would have been enough if the Gold Mine had revealed its books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent auditories that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and thinks the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr. Garver explain how he can ask for a ‘public’ debate at the same time, while ignoring the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generosely paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very beautifully ended view of the term.
In a democracy, the deceiters themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the Gold Mine.
This public is ready to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a knebel clause (in the course of the ‘public debate’ Barrick Gold has just addressed a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s claim is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the finding of truth that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been aware of getting discussions and disagreements into control and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate appeal clearly shows that, unlike what she suggests, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it’s time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and the leading Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats, together, finally reached an agreement on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shocked Wall Street for months is still to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main contents are: a better control of the MPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the public funds used, new arrangements to reduce the number of houses caught due to payment faults, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“It’s all done to protect the real economy and the American people from the short crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and discomfort in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,” the Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fear of the impact that a new failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only late to participate in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction about the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama resisted the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those that are intended to allow the owners to maintain their houses, and those that affect the salaries of the chief employees of the state-rescued companies.
‘When the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of certain persons, this is nothing to wish.
But these measures are necessary," he said on the U.S. television.
When asked on another broadcast whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope.
The guidelines that I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the breakdown of an immovable blase, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (Subprime) before it expanded to further forms of spread bonds (PCAAs), and eventually flooded into a freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Republican members failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain ‘toxic’ assets of societies in trouble should only be saved by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the sack gas.
In order to turn the point of view for all in Congress, it has also been added a provision that says that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes to keep back its used capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first amount of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion dollars must be approved in a re-vote by Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that will deposit dividends to him in case of gains, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the settlement procedures relating to the houses that are bound to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for the refund and the withdrawals that will be paid to the main employees of the affected enterprises.
The developers would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes were raised yesterday against this project, both from the Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” the Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s Financial Commission, told his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers for the cash.”
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, the leader of a group in Congress called 'the Caucus of the Skeptics', represents the things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred outstanding economists, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider which path to go,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe again got the proof that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy its competitor who is in great difficulties since it has lost 2 billion euros (2,9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
“This is not a lost money,” said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos.
For compensation, we get a right of vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savings and households appreciate, now that unsafe times are announcing. "
During this time, on the other side of the arm channel, the British government was just trying to nationalize another bank threatened by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to nationalize the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an Engaged Icon
His beauty with the blue eyes has long been his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His delicacy, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a power position that brings the really scary monsters to the world.
What a great continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the effects of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he liked and for whom he was a kind of rival on the wall for a long time, more careful in his performance, more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often brings wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the rich faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, high quality character.
For in him reflected a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific war in the battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for citizens’ rights, was the driver who became the second in the 1979 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a predictive relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, committed and over-sensitive to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death moved the film lovers to Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing with it.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes back in memory, and the young man who refers to his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot plate, filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
It is called a much shorter backward memory (1990) to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who is disturbed in his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans had been in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was recalled after his death and made Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the overwhelming The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded an Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a crazy and crazy billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was he.
Always he.
In his CV, epochs are united.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of a ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several film legends who have retreated early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the seat for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his wealth, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to ‘Underplaying’ when he judged his too expressive performances.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whom the roles flown for a long time just so.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: Neurotics, Alcoholists, Fishermen or Desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his rejection and rejection.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true fine sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drawn a fine female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to a overdose, dedicated to this 1984 his film Harry and Son, a work full of kindness and sadness.
In the flood of honours that took place over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: 'His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joy of life were the essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, the protection of the environment and the independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood defeat, is now going there.
We’ve probably often seen him standing with his foot in shells full of vinegarette, in sauces, bakes or other foods, and this was considered quite tasteless, although we found it fun at first.
The profits from his revenue, however, flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged to shoot.
He left a letter to his five daughters, saying, ‘Every time and until the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to be able to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A exemplary citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory by Supplement &amp; Co.?
On October 8 the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his complices will begin.
The accused is accused in particular of participation in organized crime, as well as gross negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document fraud.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the funds earned from the tender were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with false bills.
State funds and subsidies from self-government – a total of 65 million HUF – will be partially deposited in the Fiatal Baloldal organization’s funds, partially in the private funds of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious bills were submitted when the tender funds were awarded, and the associations should not have fulfilled their duties.
According to the accusation, a large part of the bills has been falsified.
The bill blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the bills will be issued was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee, to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
During this "exploration tour" Lados should explore pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on the consumption to be able later to issue invoices on the basis of these models to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These bills are supposed to have been mostly manipulated by István Lados and his companion, András Őri, who, according to our information, is supposed to have been responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the targets of Lados' "Expert Tour" was a beer room.
As two bills issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003 can be found, the gastronomy business is supposed to be the nine-headed group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the factory says that such a large group had not suddenly adapted to the site.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a Pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, according to the bill, 130 guests have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was obviously not limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomic enterprise in whose accounting documents of customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to the prosecutor’s authority, did not first appear.
As the chief executive Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that it was false documents when the prosecutor’s office submitted documents to him during an interrogation.
“Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp.”
And further: In addition to form errors, it was also wrong that the operation was supposed to have hosted a hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to provide so many people room.
The restaurant has also been included on the bill, while the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The Emmy counterfeiters have also refused to check that the Budapest travel agency they have visited offers exclusively to travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungarian travel on the cash account, which is also contrary to the company’s accounting practice.
As it was known during the investigations, they have also included VAT on the bills, although travel agencies relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was false on a total of four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company instead of 25 only 15 per cent of VAT was charged, in addition, the employees only issued machine invoices, but the false documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that was undertaken to the "accounts" was that in a case they had indicated "warrant transport" as the service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment counseling, the Prosecutor's Office.
Further form errors — false billing format, false stamp — were due to the fact that the bills issued at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be disclosed as false.
Likewise, in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managers claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another “feil” is to the fake people at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in dissolution at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there – the mass manager therefore admitted that the bills had not been issued by himself.
Consciously false
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they had to put fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued bills for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, in an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the charter, the CEO of the Collab Kft. was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious bills.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, has also worked together with additions and Co. In 2003, the GmbH has provided the Stiftung Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the Vereine Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with false invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which were related to non-provided services.
However, there was no payment transaction as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the persons concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian CEO of the Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based but not found fuel and vehicle trade company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of computer components in the total value of about 18 million HUF in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005, has been the buyer of these bills.
Managing Director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the firm documents should also be delivered by Ivan Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Kubatov has claimed to have issued in the name of the GmbH. invoices to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and their countervalue has been cashed by itself.
The firms Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are expected to have been founded by Romanian Maurers on the express wish of Iván Kubatov.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the accused, was a lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his complainant, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was charged with the preparation of the company’s founding documents, he issued in the name of the companies bills to the associations associated with the supplement, such as at Atlasz and Y-Generation.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices of a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The Prosecutor's Office estimates that Kubatov could have cashed 10% of the invoice and the VAT each.
Kubatov is to have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were contributed to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts were used for purpose-foreign.
To hide this, they have submitted to TMA five fictitious bills of the Works Team Kft.
These bills were, by the way, secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now counting with a confession about the method of counterfeiting, as they have already been presented before the prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main accused János added to a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he has already promised several times to report in full about everything, his confession is still out.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a treaty with him concerning the reimbursement of the majority of the damages of HUF 50 million, and whether the supplement in return is ready to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that Supplement now plays the “insulted” after his requests for relief of imprisonment and house arrest were touched on the blind ears.
While other criminals who have committed far greater damage with economic crimes and have not rewarded them are free, or at least under house arrest, add-on remains denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Supply - or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In sales, the buyers tend to spend more and thus exaggerate the default.
Neurologists and economists from the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people don't want to beat themselves in a competition, such as a sale on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even exaggerated prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cord, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overwhelming played a key role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price rise could be explained by avoiding a streat overreaction.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have further conducted investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the actual value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward for the event that they appear as a winner out of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing against losing were willing to make higher bets than those in the control or win group.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These behaviors, in fact, have found the behavior observed at auctions so far only with the pleasure of winning or risk avoiding.
The contradiction between these two theories was solved thanks to the imaging neurological methods, so we are now ready for a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you visit the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases triggered by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowness are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses spread in two different types: with hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated foods or water), with hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, sperm secretion or sperm).
Travellers are recommended a vaccine against the viruses A and B at all, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and swelling.
After that, yellowness occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year around 1 million people worldwide die from the far more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected are in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their illness, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already demonstrated by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby preventing the risk of infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, 2004 for the first time organized by patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its occurrence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research finds, religious faith acts as a kind of “smell remedy” which has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it has been studied how much faith in God affects the pain of man, the British newspaper Telegraph.
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to remove most of the pain.
A brain scan technology could even prove that Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The research was the first in a research project, in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologists from various departments of the university participated.
During the trial, the subjects were connected with a flashing device to the left hand, which delivered the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: one image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermeline".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary among the believers would cause some kind of religious transition, while they chose the picture of Vincis, because it was hardly different from the other painting and it was felt calming.
The participants spent half an hour each in a MRI scanner, and during that time they received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they should either watch the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics they had felt “in safety” when they saw the Mother of God, as if they were “careful” and they had felt “peace and peace.”
While considering the religious painting, they over 12% less pain than when they had Leonard's work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that you could produce similar effects with other, strongly influential images also in the atheists, you just need to find the corresponding picture.
“We need to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does it in many cases," Wright said.
After these outstanding results, the question remains what effect a Madonna painting of Leonardos or any other similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself.
On the occasion of her 10th birthday, Google can with fug and righteousness claim that it is found in the pockets of people just as through their heads in heaven: it knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEO.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he makes it clear: these would just ignore the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said Google’s main goal is to gather even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal, according to which it wants to “arrange all the information of this world”.
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still just at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches the search terms will be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which it was searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the “Personalized Search” introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later access it so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are based the so-called “Recommendations” with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the previous preferences.
Users, however, wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more likely to be the company’s represented, potential power that fears exciting, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for power that encounters rejection in many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but are also transmitted to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A paradigm for this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of the pedophiles.
However, users concerned with personal rights could still breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought to court against the FBI: thus, in the future, Google may not be forced with any point of the constitution to disclose information to the FBI on a secret request.
(But the federal government has successfully achieved the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, as well as their web and search terms list was left behind for two months.)
So Google’s Image remains controversial: Those who do not want to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate interest by using Google’s services, throw the company with the conservative representation of the companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users unite, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is a market leader thanks to Windows, even if both struggle for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for identification codes, and it provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package appears to be much more attractive, younger and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks look through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the internet messerscharf – a relationship that has been focused especially in recent years thanks to the term “Web 2.0”.
Web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, i.e. users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, i.e. to show themselves publicly.
A average youth can manage his profile simultaneously on several community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually incorporate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And a number of more exemplary cases proves: Watching the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her untrue friend has been enjoying, or the employee will be dismissed because he in his blog only too honestly airs his trouble about corporate management - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - so in about one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to overcome Google’s monopoly, can do it with pleasure – like using Scroogle, a tool that, though accesses Google’s search engine, does not deliberately leave any traces.
Not a few people do not deliberately register on community pages so that they are not found, but Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphics tools and RSS feed, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
The public is waiting until Google reveals its true face.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapidly introduced services are preparing headbreaks not only to Microsoft, but also to other software developers.
Critical observers, however, also find the worrying counterpoles: For example, the group leadership has completely rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management said the multi-food of the employees was too expensive. but all of this suggests quite mildly against that in 2006 Google even walked to the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could reverse a lot strongly: While some think Google’s book and magazine scan or archiving project now takes the scope that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are worried about the “Health” system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of sci-fi authors already supplies the substance - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwell way a future in which a man becomes terribly close thanks to the data referred to by Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double assassination of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of contributing to the removal of the traces, police commission spokesman Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were arrested and are currently charged with aid.
According to the news agency MTI, they are two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Assistance is threatened with a fine of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local resident, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is suspected of intentionally killing several people.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a greater debt to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he attracted his creditors on Wednesday to an area in Oz, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act of long-hand – this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the place of the assassination.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the crime weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange offered for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had placed despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs fully to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the Polish offers include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Peter Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not conclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the agreement of the shareholders, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25% share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the growing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke on Tuesday about the "second 11th of September".
The global financial catastrophe we owe to the U.S. President, said "La Repubblica" - the President was not even able to make his own party for the draft law behind him to one that should bring some relief to the scary situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more encouraging to talk about a “second 11 September.”
Parts of the press in Madrid are also located in the Sündenbock in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is guilty of the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of collapse.
The U.S. financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, it is now threatened after Congress voting that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, according to the Geneva "Day Advertiser".
Although some states could still provide rescue packages to their bankrupt monetary institutions, the banks could save the taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are broken down, no further financial sprints or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU Member States should jump over their shadows and centralize control over the monetary markets.
Only on Monday, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna "The Standard" reminds.In addition, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, the European taxpayers will now have to go a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the “Rescueers” don’t have to “competate” immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to find out in which case it would be reasonable to pay the money to the taxpayers in order to eliminate an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new accidents prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, a stunning project was presented, inspired by Nissan’s hummel engineers to create new accidents prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the autobot-controlled biomimetic system of the BR23C type, a mini-car equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In the flight, each beer forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bees, which can see in any direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To understand the function of the composed eye, the researchers approached the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately starts the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the bees’ movement by turning the tyres around the corresponding corner.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it wasn't so, the autobot could not react quickly enough to escape the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerest and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer that is still considered inevitable within accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they escape other bees.
This must be done in a short of a second.
However, the escape, unlike the bees, can not be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, and it can only be in the direction of the rotability of the tyres.
While the bees here have infinite possibilities to escape other bees, the researchers in the car robotic could only use the rotating movement, as well as acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to save them.
This device needs to process only a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn’t have to save them, or by using previous maneuver to produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so it continuously requires just a handful of KB memory.
It does not require any Gigabyte and Megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan’s estimates, will be serially in production over the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously driving the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time in the east coast, Congressmen, after several days of debate, reached an agreement on the $700 billion heavy rescue package, Reuters.
“We’ve made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be made on paper.
The compromise about the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will show effect and it will be efficient, but we have to do even more.Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the circle of the economy.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington Time Sunday evening at 8:00 (Middle-European Time Monday at 2:00) but did not trigger a height flight to the exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the draft law to stabilize the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on its turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, deviates from the original Bush administration’s recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at a time for the purchase of faul, credit-loaded securities.
In a first transition, a maximum of the half of the $700 billion will be spent, with $250 billion available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This amount is expected to be spent on the purchase of credit burden, bad securities, and the next $100 billion will be decided by the President.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on a further decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or even other "toxic" loans.
As the ministry’s officials, the purchase can be made both at an auction and directly.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as an emergency aid for the U.S. financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now assigned to state aid can expect their preparations, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas, to be cut by the government.
A reduction in wages will only occur in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will help each.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, then the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the expired bank manager is dismissed to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of false loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managerial salaries are not exaggerated.
The image also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managerial debts are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights to the participating banks, thus the risk for taxpayers is reduced as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank are getting better.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan will not protect the money of the taxpayers at all, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur said the actions were promoted by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Higher prices in plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increase the prices in chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A price decline was in raw oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in paper manufacturing, as well as in the publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the processing industry, a price rise was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily due to the price rise in gas introduced on 1 July.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the processing industry in comparison to the year, the prices in raw oil processing have increased most (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverage, and tobacco production was 11 percent.
A price decline was observed in the textile industry (2,5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).

No more visa to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on January 12, as the Foreign Minister said to representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In his opinion, “all now depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system will be introduced abroad in time.”
She also emphasized that there will be no entrance permits in the new system, but tourists should register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is holding negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will deliver her the “Middle Merit Cross with a Star” to the Republic of Hungary, and she will also conduct talks with the Foreign Policy Advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support the rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, on Sunday promised their support for the $700 billion heavy rescue package for banks.
Congress and government representatives announced on Sunday after days of marathon consultations that they have reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the rise of the frozen credit market, have become the main issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than their respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his advance thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was simultaneously shrinking.
During a campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the bill on the $700 billion package.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passes of consumer protection that he supported.
"We have to act now, and that's responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, the entire industry, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened," he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not missed to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete”.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It will be hard for us all to deal with (...) but non-stop is no alternative.”
The Republican Senator said the plan also predicts the creation of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of preparations for top managers - something he has survived.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the draft law on Monday.
Pressview of the German-speaking space
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" commented on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern in order to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (The Mirror)
In the online edition of the German news magazine located on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers."
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its positions.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – now the modern citizens are just turning away from them.
The breakdown of the era is at the same time a problem for Christian democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something ended, which, however, was recorded quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
For 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell by 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, which is still in the much cited Stoiber era.
The modernization continuously carried out by the CSU in the federal country has ultimately destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but it was significantly underestimated in the pace.But without effects, the secularization, the educational success, the admission of East and North German to the prospering regions of Bavaria could not remain to the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by multiplication of options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-will.
It is remarkable that in the past few weeks, just the classical citizens’ groups expressed the greatest distance to CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with graduates such as graduates.
The CSU’s support fell below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? party leaders with discretion in coalition issues" titled articles about the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, while the Greens are still unwilling to establish a coalition.
The new elections have passed, and now everything turns around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly saw their maps.
SPÖ chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current OVP chief as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Schüssel-Molterer course.
Repeating this direction is not questionable.
Molterer, however, responded cautiously to the red offers.
Cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is going to opposition or to the coalition is now completely open, and these questions should be discussed within the OVP.
BZÖ chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to take government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities begins in Paris, which is headed by the EU-Council Presidency country France.
In her speech to the plenary session, Fidesz deputy Lívia Járóka made attention, in particular, to the educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children face, and it is also the greatest obstacle to their need to be applied.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the leading European law enforcement and civil organization in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the Fidesz MPs, Járóka noted that in addition to discrimination in the job search, the Roma would be withdrawn from the labour market primarily because of their low educational level.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youths have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can a higher education degree."
Járóka also emphasized that education is a fundamental human right, which will play a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
According to the MPs, it is important that a broadest possible circle – that is, Roma and non-Roma – be aware of these connections.
For the earlier a Roma student begins school, the greater their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and income tax they make their contribution to national spending.
“As EU citizens, the right to high-quality education must be guaranteed – the poor and segregated education must be stopped,” Lívia Járóka said.
As the Deputies stated, a common, targeted and action-oriented action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the degradation process in the educational sector.
“We must break the devil circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-fledged citizen,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the proposal of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national levels, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace at Time
At the end of October, the fate of the falling duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the election debt, no heads are still rolling in, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates have been delayed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their positions, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss will be decided on the last October weekend at an extraordinary party congress.
However, the very scattered duo has already made it clear that it doesn’t want to stick on their seats.
Thus, they want to destroy the angry group and the party base, which a day after the “Bayer tsunami” in light of the loss of the absolute majority demanded personal consequences.
Five years ago - acknowledged, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who stands at his career height - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent.
The CSU has been a “single governor” in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party-internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Deputy President and Federal Agrarian Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the investigation team, which will conduct investigation talks with the liberal FDP, or the legally established “free voters” on a possible Munich coalition.
One irony of fate is that with the list of “free voters” that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose anti-stable appearance has first exploited the Huber-Beckstein Duo, to then serve the targeted politician without grace.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on Becstein’s stabilization.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the feeds out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called September 28 the "most bitter day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards the CDU - he believes that the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed a lot to the success in 2005 and on the national level, should not be put on the foot with a joint power act, then Merkel can’t become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heal from her disappointment about the fiasko, believes that CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
But what is relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
At the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition arrived in the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this lies with wealth and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects illegal voting.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
However, the opposition party gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who, in the unprecedented elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time would "leave" some members of the opposition in parliament.
This is why the ODS has even taken a distance from the previously planned boycott.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia’s natural gas import due to the rise in prices. For the relief of price increases even loans were accepted, and the country also agreed to the sale of the Beltrans gas, the owner of the country’s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the background of the Opposition’s expectations there was therefore the hope that Ukraine would want to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians had banned the entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
A temporary relaxation was provided in the OECD election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was more on the positive movements than on the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of one-third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s Rapid Report criticized the campaign – therefore oppositionists are not likely to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see a improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the degraded Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has regarded the two territories as independent for a month.
“We’ve made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Alexander Milinkevitch said.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although “the powerful are afraid to leave even one opposition in parliament.”
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but is rather trying to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers need to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put stones in the way in the distribution, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," Milinkevitch said, insisting that not even the most supported layer of the retirees is in agreement with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only fortune is the production of social security.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the increase in trade deficit, it’s just a matter of time until the silence of a cemetery’s ‘social security’ begins to break,” Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, the head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the actions, not the words."
Brunetta: “From now it’s breakfast before work”
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrance and exit of officials.
From today, the measure will enter into force against those slumers who first stop and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz Act” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, the Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Drive doors are a means to increase the efficiency of work through a higher presence rate and more services," Minister Brunetta said.
Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” Brunetta reiterates.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation in all buildings of the Council of Ministers ends.
Masi says that “the choice of the rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
From the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: “This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides.”
Overall, there is no more breakfast during the working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunetta says with a smile, “A good cappuccino at 7 is a miracle.”
High Commission of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announces that “in three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people per year are present at work.”
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italian public administration.
"Their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as high as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have gathered together to tackle the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacons supported appeal.
“While the Minister for Public Service profiles with numbers of smaller disadvantages in the work – the consumer center writes – the people of the ‘working fool’ are growing uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have gathered together to declare war to the unlawful norms of the decree.”
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial balances for labor-related illnesses; thus also the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the Ministry’s innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: “Prevention of work accidents is crucial”
Every day there are 2500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 remain lifelong disabled.
For the year 2007, the data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the deadly work accidents were around 1200.
These figures demonstrate the severity of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as a result of murder.
Today, the Association Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) is celebrating the 58th National Day for the Victims of Occupational Accidents in all the provinces of Italy to bring the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
“The annoying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is,” the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
He expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention at work, to the protection of the injured workers, to the support of the families of the victims and to the awareness of the public opinion."
"A annoying 'basta' has risen up here; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their size, cause some turmoil in the media and public participation. but the everyday reality often faces us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in its own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is a resource problem: it needs to be crucially invested in education and information."
A special importance is given to the numerous initiatives for direct awareness in school frameworks by the youth who feed themselves to the work world.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness.
On the other hand, Chamber President Gianfranco Fini emphasized “how the phenomenon of work-related deaths represents an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to end the problem.”
“The work accidents data seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘positive trend’ to mean less attention; that’s what ultimately causes the tragedy.”
"How do you believe that you are doing too little to confront the phenomenon of accidents? you can fight it through various actions.
We believe that stronger inspections and inspections are necessary – said Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school.”
“A further effort is necessary – he adds – as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers is required to face a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli also spoke about “the progressive deterioration of the protection for the victims of work accidents” and prosecuted “the acquisition of the social system against which we have fought in recent years.”
"The goal is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations that are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 Player Accused: Danger of Hearing Damage
Listening to sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of Csrseri (the scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
“The report shows clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day with portable music devices are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who put the usual wearable music devices and phones on a high volume will irreversibly damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific findings – as it is said by the EU – show a clear risk that urges for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examinate the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and follow the new technology.”
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - concludes the EU communication - confirm that one is too concerned and that the European Commission will now, together with the other EU members and those affected, investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and youth from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from a too large noise load.
These damages can be very limited, with solutions such as reducing the noise and the length of the noise display.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union notes that when users of portable music devices only five hours a week listen to loud (more than 89 decibels) music so that the legal limits already have exceeded the maximum noise level applicable at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk complete hearing loss within five years.
This accounts for 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno to launch the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it will be over, in June the balance sheet will be drawn.
This is the course established by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome".The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Thermans.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" provided by the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno emphasizes. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibilities remain the City and Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of powers, only the will to have a place where you can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be terminated in March and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission.”
To those who question the competence of the Commission, because their opinion is not compulsory, Alemanno replies: “It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If it, like the Attali Commission in France, provides quality results – and this will surely be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to have a longer period of time to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city.”
“This commission is neither an useless institution nor a crack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Romanian citizens a penny and it will bring us to think, it will occupy the best heads of the capital.”
“It is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor statistic to enable our city a quality jump – which it really needs – and thus to take a joint step towards the future.”
A future, he said, "which will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further," not only in terms of the role of Rome as the metropolitan and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician, who is much due to being regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and managed relations with the enemy Islam (and is still doing this today as a private man).
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more violent, just now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very sad: he thinks he will get the highest post of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!
In fact, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they’re racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president?
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the election cabin we will probably know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which has been kept hidden until the end.
“Say what you want, then we’ll decide for whom we’re going to make our crouchs, whether for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we’ll emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – just now where the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a hit in the back.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
However, Iraq remains for the majority the weakness of Bush.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse leaves its traces also in journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. and many accuse the Internet, the “mortal” of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they expressed to whom the information concerning the competent was not really concerned about the general credibility.
You don’t feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Additionally, the big problems are due to the newsroom’s cuts, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It’s a problem that needs to be solved – the interviewed journalists say – if you want to prevent that traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, does not significantly shorten.
A clear but complicated pessimism meets the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong path.
In the local area, it is even 65% of the executives.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine what direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups run the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted they want to join the new technology, hoping “that will bring something good to journalism.”
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of chief editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with “security at work”.
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of “safe work” in the team (our “redaktor”, Anm. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors often get very high wages, the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, including pensions and insurance funds.
As for holidays, the matter becomes complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach after a certain number of years 15 holidays.
But American journalists, as they acknowledge themselves, are often "sick" over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL in Rome: Danilo Copola remains in Grottaferrata
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate broker, who had therefore requested to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation on the countercontract in case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked for the real estate broker to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transmissions (on which the Prosecutor’s Office had appealed) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and access the evidence alleged to him.
The Elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had appeared a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: a large portion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the last edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis is progressing to spread the Republican Party, which is more and more divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always benefited the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives, which hostily confront "the Washington" and the financial world, and for example, in the south and the center of the states wins voters.
This part of the party owes its rise in front of the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This previously mentioned example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, also throughout the West and beyond, they will be affected by.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unexpected Renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions that have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an immense amount of assets of private households living in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for the governments: how to behave with the affected families, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis appears economicly global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen away in itself and lost its speech: the brilliant proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its second division in various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
So now everyone is expecting the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, etc. Distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign assistance.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use these: therefore, two conditions that are not to be overwhelmed – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organization or market will be able to use in a similar way.
The new emphasis on the state-national element is, in the rest, in perfect consensus with the increasing importance that is recently associated in the economy with one of the closest related sectors: the territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is right now that when we were so convinced that we have long entered a connected universe, a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we must suddenly realize how our future will become more and more dependent on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but they are still connected to the outer with a closely described piece of Earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who possesses such a territory is in advantage over the other who lives in a landless, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second news, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Whoever says territory, whoever says government, whoever says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disturbance over the existing leaders, e.g. those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadows.
Finally, there is a deeper, richer, and in a certain sense still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, an image of inefficiency, a feeling of distance, all of which is aimed at a whole class of managers of the western countries.
It seems so that the belief among large portions of the population is going on the way that it is not first the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is more and more foreign and overwhelming to the majority.
This manifests itself in the unpredictable “revolutions” of the voters and in the immediate transformation of the collective mood of recent times: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, to the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and the victory of the Right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression of the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value in relation to what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is further strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebelion of the masses".
However, keeping the eyes open is not possible.
The superbone that leads to the walls
To be able to defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a stick and to lift the walls like Superman.
This is the object of four U.S. research centers, one of which is now apparently almost reached the target.
With a container placed on a surface of only 2.5 sq.cm, the researchers managed to fix a body weighing 100 kg on a shining wall.
The STUDIO – a American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanoparks.
“The principle of the cluster can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-arranged pipe,” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the gecos, which are covered by microscopic worms that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass teflon and slice paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holdability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "problemlessly removes from the wall," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitional adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe yes, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanoparks are also the drivers of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the spacecraft.
For the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
The Other Art of Research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of clay.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a micro-fiber adhesive that, as hair moves on a surface, cleans itself from dust and thus always preserves a perfect responsibility.
Remedies: Never take with fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if taken simultaneously with certain vital medications, as they can affect the body’s absorption in extreme ways.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in conjunction with drug intake. At the 236th Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again raised an alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the intake capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolithic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
The same agency of the drug had in a report two years ago warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, and emphasizes to be careful about what will be drunk in connection with means such as diazepane or metadon.
It’s NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of the active substances inhibited by the fruit seeds is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the Director of the Università Statale di Milano: “These results are usually immediately transmitted to the various international manufacturers, which are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the packaging note and, if there are uncertainty, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor,” the expert of the Ansa agency emphasizes.
Economic Nobel Prize to Paul Krugman
The economic prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times head article that this second event had been more crucial for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prerequisite, which received not a little polemic as a response and was kept for the economist years later, today, however, proves to be completely correct.
“I’m surprised and shocked about how quickly the memories of the Enron or Worldcom collapse scandals have disappeared from the public perspective,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value" but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, which is especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office, gains an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among publishers and in the public administration.
After a year of intense work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself with some news to the audience: in addition to a revised and now spartan-designed starting menu, it is finally achieved a due to guaranteed compatibility with Apple’s operating system Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version, has been given.
Eight against was also added to the compatibility with Microsoft’s Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read through OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, facilitates sending via email. This includes the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time retain the original appearance of the page.
Thus, you can also generate “hybrid” PDF files that extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format through the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most enhanced elements of the applications: tables can now be multi-handed by different users, avoiding conflicts in case of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a request to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are currently publishing various functions of OpenOffice on the cloud, while the definitive result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, the freedom of spending can be an incentive for the spread of the program in the private households, so it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: finally, several public administration institutions and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to extract from Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the more familiar Access; and last drawing, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily overcome with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Kohl also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case.
It opens a new doping case in the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-class and winner of the trick of the best climbers.
The news was published by the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who has been positively tested on Cera, the EPO of the third generation.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those that have been done in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry labs.
If the controversy confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest, and informed the Austrian officials, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the trick of the best climbers for himself.
The New York Times Question: Is Italy Racist?
Italy, “the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants,” which is only accepted with opposition.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists?The New York Times asks this in a long article all dedicated to the topic of racism in Italy and based on the fall of the young, Burkina Faso-stamming Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of cakes.
The case testifies of what the Times calls the “Paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those in which “the most integration and employment opportunities” exist, and yet “the highest degree of anti-immigration feelings and the greatest support of the Northern League is to be recorded.”
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times is referring to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and for the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also referred to as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also emphasizes the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to fight racism."
Student victims of up to €900 per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students knows no crises.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the rental union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious traits. whole scores of students actually lose their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level," says the Sunia official, Laura Mariani, "in these cities the large demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized subcontracts.
For Sunia, there is the need to take extraordinary measures, which will lead to lower rental prices by revising the taxation.
With a more detailed consideration of the investigation it turns out that in Milan a bedroom in the Brianza district will be required for about 450 euros; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bedroom costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room is 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the districts around the university, 250/280 euros for a bedroom of needles, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rental in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who escape outdoors can save money: €300 for a bedroom and €450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bedroom, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bedroom costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of lease to overseas students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a lease, which is 25-30% above the average, is required by foreign students.
Welcome to the Old Paradiso Cinema – The Cities Closing Their Historic Cinemas
The historic cinemas are closed due to the beneficial multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image of Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saal complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death for the single-saal cinema in the center. A process that not only seems irreversible and irreversible, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
Mostly historical places full of memories are affected, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've put a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who gave him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago.
The figures provided by the Anec, the Central Trade Union, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the immense number of 316 traditional cinemas has had to be closed; these characters mostly paid the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Toscana with 44 and the Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main guilty are the multiplexkinos, because it’s just those three regions in which the greatest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years the Lombardy is leading the lists, 81 are both in Toscana and in the Emilia-Romagna.
“The business has evolved in an irrational way,” said Paolo Protti, the chairman of the Anec, “if it is useful that new structures are also emerging, but on the first place is the preservation of the already existing, because if a hall is closed in the city, not all its tribal customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old.
And here remains the lack of state for the trade union fund out of eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not observe the existing laws.
To maintain the sector, it would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year of need.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, due to the fears about the old cinemas, decided to protect them through an agreement between the community and the Anec; this is the first agreement of this kind in Italy that aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center and in the periphery.
The proposed measures include tax preferences for the film drivers as well as benefits for the public in relation to near-traffic: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at more affordable parking fees.
“It’s a pleasant initiative,” Giuseppe Tornatore said, “I hope that other cities will join our example and further develop new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to counter the superpower of the multiplex cell, because in the end the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to the foundation of the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass through the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so that I don’t have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of Mayor of Gioia Tauro
“Gioia Tauro’s mayor was ready to adapt the municipal decisions to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations of the Kalabriens Antimafia Authority against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for manipulation in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his cousin: the lawyer, who has the same name as the boss of the clan, was already sentenced for interference in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"In spite of any moral and legal standards," the lawyers write, "the two local governments have decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
“Therefore, the mafia group was made possible – the judges said – to officially enter the Rathauses and to contribute to the policy of public administration.”
The Chairman of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that it is in his region "all other than an exception to confront connections of local governments and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: Heroes who retain a white west."
The arrest of this morning follows those of last July, with whom the Piromalli clan was kidnapped, according to the police.
Since the end of last April, the municipality of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipalities were dissolved.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the UDC, was elected head of the coalition after the May 2006 election.
He shouted a scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipality.
He addressed Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he claimed to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with the arrest order of this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change of the A3 project.
From an interrogation in connection with the investigations on the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the desires of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making the actions of public administration identical with the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes from the waves, the great ones suddenly run up.
It is a non-versive source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now it seems to be understood by the world’s major energy firms.
Waves, currents and currents are the new renewable energy sources that now everyone is looking at and also seeking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not accidentally, these studies have intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the oil price collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was broken down, but now the environmental organizations and the oil price rise are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the ocean waves generated energy.
This is equal to the double amount of energy produced by nuclear power plants.
Additionally, there are also the flows and flows.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies in the traditional energy industry are now investing in marine energy earnings.
“Chevron is exploring these technologies,” the spokesman of a company known to the U.S. giant said in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, e.g. considering that the U.S. continues to promote oil just in Alaska, and President Bush just recently launched plans for new burns.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, the observers say of an increasing interest.
and improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in development, not least because the last doubts have not yet been cleared by the environmental defenders.
Until now, projects like that in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with a much greater environmental impact.
There are different options: Ocean Power uses a system of connected boys.
The blow of the waves, which moves the boots up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer through columns and cylinders.
It drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast through underwater lines.
Until now there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the gained energy could also serve for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a shopping house and a parking area using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the periods drive the turbines, which through the emerging turn movement feed the generator.
According to Verdant, a long serpent of potential customers already awaits the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the waves.
A special interest, according to the Institute for Electricity Research, is instantly worthy of the potential that is in time.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the weather is better predictable than wind streams, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is the time energy that the states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to $35 million are already planned for 2009.
