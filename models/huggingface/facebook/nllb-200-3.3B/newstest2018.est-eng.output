In Estonia and Spain, four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested
According to Postimehe, the police in Spain arrested the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group, Slava Gulevich, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was arrested in Spain, was arrested on a warrant.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
Suspected members of the so-called Kemerovo Criminal Association aged between 27 and 57 years, who are mainly involved in drug-related crimes.
In the Spanish province of Malaga, the alleged leader of a criminal gang was arrested in Mijas.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom, according to the information collected, is a leader of a criminal group and two are members of a criminal group.
The evidence collected suggests that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The aim of the criminal association was to commit drug offences and thus to obtain criminal proceeds,' commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We cannot rule out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase", added the prosecutor.
These are people who have been targeted by law enforcement in the past, and some of them have served time for drug offenses.
Verte stressed that the cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become routine for us, and this week's operation is a success", commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said the arrests were the result of a nearly one-and-a-half-year investigation.
"Then, in the first half of the week, a long-term work was realised and we detained the suspects in the crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time", he said.
Leis added that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were assisting in the arrest in Spain.
For years we have had a good relationship and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we will catch them from the other side of Europe", said Leis.
The information gathered so far shows unequivocally that the suspects may continue to commit new crimes while in custody, which is why the prosecution requested and the court approved their arrest.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting extradition to Estonia.
In this case, property, vehicles and cash were seized to secure the confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police and are conducted by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court found Slava Gulević guilty of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitš, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he started to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who worked at various hotels and demanded a monthly royalty from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and enforced judgments confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, the recent judgments on the so-called Dikaev criminal network, which separated eight defendants from the criminal case, from whom 80 000 euros of criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the judgement on nine persons in the case of Igor Aleynikov, who in 2006 created a criminal network aimed at the illegal trade in secret documents and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Virunga and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds is about 71 500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been to exchange information with police officers and prosecutors from outside the EU on a daily basis, and to take joint action with prosecutors from any EU country where necessary.
A civil rights group warns against traveling to Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri of the state's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is effective until August 28, 2017, calls on all African American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to be especially vigilant and extremely cautious when traveling throughout the state, in light of the wide range of suspicious racially motivated incidents that have recently occurred across the state and here".
The NAACP said the group was prompted to issue the travel warning by a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination cases and by the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by state law enforcement.
"Civil rights of human beings are being violated.
They are being drawn to the streets because of the color of their skin, they are being beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so many complaints before".
It's the first warning of its kind ever issued by the organization against a U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black woman from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year under suspicious circumstances after he was struck by a gasoline-fueled car while driving across the state, and Missouri State Police took him into custody without ever charging him with a crime.
In addition, the commentary refers to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general showing that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what might happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking a deposit or informing relatives that they are going to the state".
Based on the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, which puts the state in 16th place nationally for the number of hate crimes.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU said increased racial profiling.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the State Department about other countries, but recently interest groups have begun using this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What should everyone know about the various forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, can be caused by five different types of hepatitis - hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
The cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can progress to cirrhosis, or cirrhosis of the liver, and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Health, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all forms of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stool, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter is also the source of the popular name jaundice, which is a liver infection.
In children, hepatitis may occur without any signs.
The different types of liver inflammation can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can progress to chronic hepatitis and go for decades without symptoms, meaning that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar identifies the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses are passed from sick person to sick person and can infect us by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, by sexual intercourse, by contact with food, surfaces, objects, and drugs from the hands and faeces of an infected person.
People at risk for hepatitis A include family members and caregivers of the patient, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug users, travellers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can prevent infection, especially recommended for heavy travellers and those at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to observe daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of narcotic drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated toiletries (toothbrushes, shaving equipment), donor blood, sex with a person with hepatitis B, and from a mother to her fetus/child.
People at risk for hepatitis B infection include injection drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborn mothers who are infected, sick family members and carers, health care workers, emergency workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis B.
Vaccination is possible for the prevention of hepatitis B in humans; in particular, it is recommended that people in high-risk groups be vaccinated, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: avoidance of using foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharp tools and needle-nails, tattooing and piercing, and use of condoms to prevent infection during promiscuous sex or avoidance of risky sexual behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with blood from a sick person, injection of narcotic drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated toiletries, donated blood, sexual intercourse with a person with hepatitis C, and from a mother to her fetus/ newborn.
The risk groups for hepatitis C infection include injection drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, ill family members and caregivers, healthcare workers, emergency workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, persons infected with HIV and travellers visiting countries with a high incidence of hepatitis C.
Prevention measures against hepatitis C include: avoidance of the use of unfamiliar hygiene and manicures, other sharp objects and needle-nails, tattooing and piercing, and condom use during contagious sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other bodily fluids, by infected syringes and needles, by sexual contact, and rarely from an infected mother to an infected fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is the chronic hepatitis B virus and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses are spread by the fecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including through the consumption of low-calorie meat, fish and shellfish, through donor blood, through collective farmed syringes, and from infected mothers to fetuses.
Travellers may become infected in countries with a high incidence of hepatitis E.
Prevention measures for hepatitis E include the observance of hygiene requirements: washing or disinfecting hands after using the toilet, before preparing and eating food, after caring for a sick person.
Wash fruits and vegetables before eating, avoid eating unheated meat, fish, and seafood, drink only safe water, and avoid drugs.
Although the four-time Olympic champion was being pushed off the track by competitors on the final lap, Farah, 34, found strength in the final sprint and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think twice, but after the finish, he pulled his wife, Tania, and the children onto the track.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful", Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for her fifth consecutive title in London, the 5000 and 10,000 meter gold doubles.
Anything is possible if you believe.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Story of the Portrait of Gustav Klimt by Adele Bloch-Bauer" delves deeply into the cultural life of late 19th and early 20th century Vienna from the birth of one of the masterpieces.
But more deeply into history.
The fearful information might have been used up, the more pointed, narrow subject matter might have been allowed to have more impact on the portrait of the extraordinary story.
At present, it would be like two books between the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in Gustav Klimt's painting "The Lady in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history book on the respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book is set in the bustling cultural life of Vienna, and anyone who has been to the Austrian capital can hardly imagine what life was like in the Ringstraße area more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Café Centrale turned when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural workers was high in one of Europe's wealthiest cities, and seeing a familiar name in a book made you feel a little more cultured.
But the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city with incurable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe doesn't seem to add anything to the story.
Or perhaps, each pair of brushstrokes adds color to the cultural life of early 20th century Vienna.
A Dream of Travel to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population of Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the turn of the century, almost one in ten of Vienna's inhabitants was Jewish.
Adele's parents were newcomers to Vienna, too, but by the time Adele married twice, to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt's famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet wasn't drawn to the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you see "The Lady in Gold", it's hard to believe that in the last years of her life, this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife for Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna at the moment.
The Klimt order cost 4,000 kroner at the time, a quarter of the price of a good-location country house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of the master's love affair with the model did not deter the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that developed during the work lasted until the end of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lovely lady, you are a woman.
The portrait of the artist by Gustav Klimt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, a remarkable story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before he began working with Adeles, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that it was the splendid mosaics of Empress Theodora that inspired the artist to paint a golden portrait of Adeles as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dame in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and about the same time (in the years 1907-1908) another gold painting "Kiss" was born.
The resemblance between the two women did not go unnoticed by art historians.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
"I think I owe it to my friend Klimt to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished that the Klimt collection of their family would go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had a portrait of the finished Adèle.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925) she asked that her husband leave two of her portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
She left her jewelry to her nieces, Maria and Luisa.
A year after Klimt completed the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed to pass the drawing exam.
Although sometimes considered to be the reason for Hitler's later anti-Semitism was that Jewish professors did not accept him into the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, by 1939 the task of the Austrian Gallery, as mentioned in Maria's will, had changed significantly - it had become important to find works of art that were acceptable to the Nazi Party from Vienna's rich Jewish art collections.
Hitler's personal art collection also included some works from Adele's home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi looting of the artworks, a ten-year legal battle between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer family began.
Let it be noted here that if you see "The Kiss" at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna, you must go to the Neue Galerie in New York to see "The Lady in Gold" by Adele Bloch-Bauer.
And before you go to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions were swirling after the book's closure more around the Nazi and Jewish theme than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So, not so much a portrait, but rather a family history - and a very moving story.
The family tree of the Bauers mentioned at the beginning of the book made it much easier to get a sense of what was going on.
A 17-year-old swimmer in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
In the previous season, Gold was very close to his own 200-meter backstroke personal best swimming 2.16.62.
The mark comes from a 17-year-old girl who last week clocked a time of 2:16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships.
Gold was the last, maybe tenth, to make the A-Final.
In the final, he ran a time of 2:15.76 to finish in a tie for seventh place with a new, powerful mark.
She was just over half a second behind Alina Kendzior's Estonia record of 2:15.13.
Gold's all-time ranking is third, and his fresh personal best is fifth on the all-time list.
The young prospect is still competing in the Canadian adult championships in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and the 200 m and 400 m medley.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
She won the silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle with a time of 2:03.22.
The last time an Estonian swam that distance was in 2008.
The fastest swimmer to have ever swum this distance in Estonia is the Estonian record-holder Elina Partõka.
The Canadian-born Estonian also won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with a great personal best and the new Estonian season's top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is a year older than her, has swum that distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached his personal best in the 100 m backstroke by posting a time of 1.03.69 in the opening round of the event.
In the half-distance, she only finished seventh, swimming in the final in 2:17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season standings at four different distances.
President Trump is going on vacation, critics are grinding their teeth.
It's holiday time - that means a break for US President Donald Trump too.
But with Trump having been the president who has taken the most vacations, critics are already grinding their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is planning a 17-day water-free vacation at the eponymous golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation started yesterday, Trump's opponents have been talking about vacation for weeks.
They're offering Trump too many breaks.
In fact, the president is known to spend his weekends at his mansions in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most overwhelmed president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was on vacation for less than half as long as Trump, just 21 days.
But Trump has a tendency to forget things quickly.
Within days of becoming president, Trump said on 60 Minutes that there would be no time for long vacations during his term, because there was so much to do.
He also expressed his displeasure with Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president tweeted back then, "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is beheaded journalists".
White House officials say a 17-day visit to the golf club isn't exactly a relaxation.
It's officially called a work break, during which Trump has no time for reading or other mental activities.
Besides, there must be another reason for the leave.
The air conditioning system on the West Wing of the White House is being shut down, and all staff have been ordered to evacuate.
The West Wing also contains the Oval Office and other offices of the President.
"I don't think any of you would want to be on the west side of the building in August when it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning", said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
Where President Trump will be spending the next 17 days, you can get a sense of it from the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook - don't run for public office if you can't stand the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the disadvantage of the media.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start smearing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Naturally, he was irritated by the criticism.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken from us, and we may be led, dumb and silent, like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who's going to have to make an effort to be more like Washington.
Hogan's people have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The Kubernets have dismissed the case and online commentary has been buzzing with "Who Cares?" reactions.
"It's just Facebook", many people said.
But it does.
And that counts for a lot, especially when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
His approval rating is second best among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a mindless, reactive douche.
He's led the state with a firm hand and has stood firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite cleverly as his main tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, by showing his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
So, the Governor's Page, which is an official public forum run by a staff paid in taxpayer dollars, blocking people from visiting is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press secretary, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's conduct in an interview with The Washington Post, saying that the blocking of comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's all too easy to paint a picture of the Internet trolls cursing, the spammers, or the angry mob.
The Post interviewed several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are -- real people who are interacting with their elected leaders -- the teacher, the business owner, the pastor, not the Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, from Bowie, Maryland, was not inciting hatred, but actual hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news", she wrote in the comment section of The Post's newsletter.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same issue, someone immediately and indifferently calls it a collective effort, instead of admitting that it's a lot of concern for the citizens".
What the governor's office called a "directed spam attack" would probably be called "public support".
The Facebook era allows for easy tweaking of posts by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than the old days when you had to send out workers to do the same thing, to collect and burn critical headlines or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first government official to be criticized for taking down Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant court decisions on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the former Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's day, the impact of the pocket-sized postcards was similar to the impact of the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the quadrupling of newspaper circulation and anonymous writers frustrated his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote to the newspapers under such names as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions untenable.
According to historical documents collected as part of the online George Washington Letters Collection Project, his cabinet was buried under petitions criticizing his positions on the friendship, trade, and shipping treaties with Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And good leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty is looking for the comfort of home territory at the Renaissance Club.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty will be relying on the comfort of home territory for the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf course of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who last year led the nearby Archerfield Links on the final lap before succumbing to Paul Eale, has now settled into the new venue and will be stepping in as the tournament ambassador in place of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built, and now we're seeing the club shine in all its glory with this event", Rafferty said.
"The players see the track at its best, it's in a glorious condition.
Jerry's done a great job of setting up this place.
He's a passionate supporter of the game of golf and proud of what he's accomplished here.
It makes the track look great".
The Englishman is looking forward to defending his first title, despite having won on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling", said the Southport native.
"I was unable to defend my Extremadura Open title because it was removed from the schedule a year after my victory.
It's magical to be back in that dump.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win was special.
It was a very special time that we will always remember".
And home field returns Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour earlier this year, when he turned 50.
This is his first event in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It's always a little more meaningful to play at home", said Orr of Helensburg.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel the extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again immensely and have shown a fairly decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going".
Joining the trio on the field is former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and seniors tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, and parking costs £5 for a single-passenger car and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Gold-Rich Land of Indonesia
When Bardina Degee cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He doesn't even use a potty.
In a wooden hut in Enarot, the capital of the Paniai regency in the remote Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife places a bataad, called nota in the local language, directly in front of her.
After half an hour, remove the charred mold from the fire and insert it into the skin with unwashed hands.
He does not sit on the muddy floor - he does not have any furniture - and does his daily household chores, such as washing the laundry with the spring water from a nearby spring.
The role of the handyman is played by the bucket in the roofless room.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not assigned to tend any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
But working late can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after five o'clock in the evening", he says.
It's a rare glimpse into the life of the hill country of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in the presence of occupying forces.
The movement to free itself from Dutch domination was fueled by a rapid outpouring of anger against the Jakarta government, which still maintains its strong control over the area, keeping out foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to the independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarothal is both remote and desolate, and it takes about 90 minutes to reach it by air from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabira, and then a five-hour journey by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people is made up of tree houses surrounded by bamboo palms and covered with wavy iron roofs that have been turned into rust-colored brown houses.
Very few Indonesians have made the trip, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
Other changes were made.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes", says Degei, referring to her hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and tight skirt.
"Before, we wore only vegetable parts on our bodies".
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also the gold-rich land of Indonesia.
Just 60 miles from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 people in New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted from this mine approximately USD 3,1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts an estimated $78 billion worth of timber for use.
But these riches are a source of suffering for the popes, as they cause the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 New York Times investigation revealed that Freeport paid approximately US$20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
The efforts of the Papists to secure greater autonomy threaten this golden rule and are being cruelly handled.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 more than 500,000 papuat have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the hill country of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Birsbane, "We are losing everything", contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly widespread) and the violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws are tightened even more because Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographics are changing because of the influx of Muslim economic migrants from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese family restaurants serve gado-gado, a vegetable and a mixed vegetable, with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a traditional market cheaper than the local paapuas", explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Panai and moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
"The native papuas - the papua mama-mama's [women] - are therefore losing their market share".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former chief of staff won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But the Pope has changed very little, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for restoring justice", You says.
In fact, Paniai was in a slump just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols by the fire in Enarotalis when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorbikes out of the darkness.
The kids who met them told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to the story of the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with the buttons of their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, things escalated even more.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women, and children gathered at the soccer field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial jahivibus and performed the Paapua mee pago waita dance, which involved a circle of jumping and mimicking the song of birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them", said an official document seen by TIME magazine but not released to local media.
Elder Yeremias Kayame, 56, of the Kego Koto ward of Enarota, sensed the threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"I was suddenly shot in the left wrist when I turned around", he told TIME magazine in his brightly painted tree house porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers who had gathered.
"The people were many, and the land was plentiful", he adds.
A local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", told TIME magazine from the island of Yohanes, who uses only one name, like many Indonesians.
"I saw that she was dead... and I kissed her".
Papuan Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only ensuring the safety of their own precinct because it was attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when we are threatened with death", said Papua Police Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesman for the police, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the killings didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case now so it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to address crimes against human rights that have occurred.
But almost immediately followed by an apology.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes", he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto retracted his comments, saying he had no intention of establishing a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be settled according to the law".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during a bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Papua, including one in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the panic received such claims with a gloomy disbelief.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made", said Yohanes.
"I'm tired of it".
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm afraid", he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot".
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to solve this incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after helping bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers visiting Paniai in the neighboring regency of Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 were injured, including children, when a fight broke out between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's office on the construction site.
Police say the villagers threw rocks at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian Military Police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a panic, we were afraid of retaliation", said Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the delivery of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The parliament of Deiyai has called for the police involved to be held to account and for the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of planned development is fueling the discontent of the Mi, Moni, Dani and Damili tribes living in the desolate central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuan people, by conducting random attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Paniaiaia, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state", has detained and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniai in recent years.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the Papuan people, Paniai is known as "a tragic forgotten place".
Poverty is the root of discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotalis is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is just as elusive.
People grow all their food themselves - mainly sweet potatoes, plus a few fruits and leafy vegetables.
The field is tended by women, each of whom can tend four or five potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest at the local market.
Ten of these are only 10,000 Indonesian rupiahs (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between the native Paapuans and the new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of the new airlines at Nabire airport has widened.
The few jobs that do exist go to better-educated and more affluent immigrants.
The priests themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Secession keeps the eyes of the world off Paapu.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on external media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "failing to observe the appropriate practices", even though they had been granted a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from Papua's most troubled eastern provinces and West Papua face new threats - visa refusals and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of a sharp eye from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various widespread crimes" in Papua, including the Paniai shootings.
The following countries have also supported the LUR historically.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry, dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights violations".
The local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When an official Dutch delegation led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baari visited Jayapura on May 4, local people who were at the meeting, according to a source who requested anonymity, broke their silence, urging: "We want freedom".
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the papal states do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Paniai", says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to convey to Jokowi that in addition to living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the people of Paniai are suffering from deprivation because of poor education and health services.
Gobai said that the people of Paniai, like the other Baapuas, consider their vote for Jokowi a debt that must be paid.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims made a final symbolic stand - burying one victim's body in the ground opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they at least do not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed", Yacobus says, his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
A fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 1,108-foot-high, 79-story building.
It's the second fire in just two years to have ravaged a high-rise, which happens to be called Torch, or the Torch of Destruction.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke to the sound of fire alarms and the shouting of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor", a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Defence officials, firefighters extinguished the fire at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on high-heat outdoor surfaces around the world.
The investigation by the Torch Board following the 2015 fire found that the most damaged were the facade panels - the exterior decorative panels and insulation.
British police have said that they believe that insulation and panels on the façade of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that broke out there in June, killing some 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be big hits in the fall.
Spring and fall are a sweet time for tech enthusiasts, as phone manufacturers release their new top-of-the-line models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were sold, and in the autumn, new smartphones are expected to hit the shelves.
According to Kristjan Seema, Tele2's marketing and sales director, the streets are characterised by the innovative design of the flagship, the eye-catching scanner, the 4K resolution screen from the edge of the screen and the ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 has created a huge buzz in the tech world, and it has also reached the top of the smartphone sales charts in Estonia.
Sagar allows the newcomers even more intense fast charging, a more durable battery, a better camera, and greater resistance to water and dust.
He added that the rumours already allowed for speculation and predictions about the four top models that are likely to dominate the sales charts this year.
These four flagship smartphones will be available in the U.S. by the fall of this year.
The highly anticipated iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit the shelves as early as mid-September.
Rumors of what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do are spreading.
While the iPhone 7 didn't bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to bring a new model that is completely different from the previous models.
It's said to be four colors: black, white, pink gold, and chrome.
One element of the new design is apparently a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is missing, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's head of design, Jony Ive, insists that the new iPhone should look like a smooth glass.
There's also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-level scanner, wireless charging and an even better camera, expect a faster A11 processor.
It's probably one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the latest Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the new Galaxy Note 8 might look like.
The S Pen is reportedly designed for even more business users, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wave angle and the other a narrower telephoto lens.
At this point, no one knows why the two rear cameras are in the way, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test of a device that is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
But we're looking forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, it is still missing its flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be presented on August 16.
We're expecting a 5.3 inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia, and a super-sophisticated Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a very durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium body and a significant water and dust resistance rating of IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
While Sony's flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
Speculation about the new Sony model is that it will have a screen at least six inches.
We'll see what the reality is in a few days, because traditionally, Sony has unveiled its fall flagship at the IFA, the international technology show, which this year takes place from September 1 to 6.
Leaked transcripts of phone calls show Trump pressing Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has released transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, urging him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States berated him for publicly condemning the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press".
Trump built his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Also released were transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbully that the agreement to take in refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous", "dumb", and "stupid", and that the agreement made during the Obama administration would make him "a leader" for offering to ban the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended his speech by telling Turnbull that "the most unpleasant thing I've said all day".
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their bid for the purchase of bus transportation from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree rejecting the bid of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid to the Tartu bus terminal because the bid did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Rights Service.
This is a public service contract for the provision of bus transport services within the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Court of First Instance refused to hear it.
While many on social media complain that the weekend festival's noise is disrupting their nightlife and the entire city is full of drunken revellers, there are many who have nothing bad to say about the beach-going festival.
I'm even positively surprised that the party people in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any disrespect or rudeness.
I even saw kindness", says the widowed Laine.
"It's nice to be born, to be and to feel the joy of the Pärnös, which is winter like a winter feeling", he adds cheerfully.
The dark clouds that rise from the shore, Laine, don't disturb your sleep.
If he could hear music playing on the beach in the city center, it hadn't reached his home yet.
"But I hope I can hear", he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to the evening paper, says that the big festival is better for Pärnu - it certainly helps the local merchants to make money.
He is also delighted that so many foreigners have come to the summer capital.
Noisy parties don't bother a woman.
I mean, I'm not on the beach anymore, but it's nice to see the beach come alive.
And it's great that the people are moving and it's already happened three times", she says.
I think it was a little worse the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints", he thinks.
But the noise on the beach, he says, is common to summer residents.
"This Weekend is a great promo for our little town", says Harry, a park enthusiast.
The noise and the noise have not affected his rhythm of life.
But why?!
We should all stick together.
Think of how this interracial communication would be better.
The music of the valley does not crush a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live right next door.
"Good people can stick together and there's no problem", he says.
He says the guests at the fair are very nice.
"They've gone a little too far with the poodles, of course, but young people are young, and my God - let's go, but be human and we can do it!" she says.
By then, the coastal inhabitants have moved away to a distant place, either to be with relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive effect on life - people like that kind of noise", says Tiina, who walks with her children in Pärnus.
Nor does the music of the festival disturb his family's sleep, although last year it sounded even more distant from the street.
Last summer, the stage was turned around, so we heard more.
We live outside the city, which is quite comfortable down by the Pärnu river", he says.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to revive the business.
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its dividend by 72 percent, triggering another restructuring program to address a looming business crisis.
The Commission notes that the restructuring plan was approved by the Commission on 30 June 2013, and that the restructuring plan was approved by the Commission on 1 July 2013.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs under its third cost-cutting programme by a further £300 million (US$394 million) to try to revive a business that has been hampered by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its expectations for the year had not changed after reporting a 1 percent increase in sales revenue of N2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabaghi district of the city.
The bombing is the latest in a series of violent attacks in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in Tuesday's mosque attack in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by "a man-made explosive device".
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the growing strength of the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh are a serious concern for the NATO forces in Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
A massive bombing in the city centre on May 31 killed more than 150 people - the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops assisting the country's military and police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politicians and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reversed its decision to postpone the suspension of the Regulation following an action
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed a decision to delay the implementation of an Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit their emissions of soot, one day after 15 states sued the agency over its actions.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with the "2015 ozone assessment process" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperate with States Parties.
"We believe we need to engage with our state partners and listen to them", EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had reported EPA's intention to postpone the ozone level determinations - which measure the ozone layer in different parts of the country to determine where it should be lowered to meet the strictest air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
Fifteen predominantly Democratic states filed a lawsuit Tuesday, along with the District of Columbia, saying the decision is unconstitutional.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, part of what Trump says is a broader plan to market economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked a backlash among Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased health impacts of pollutants.
The EPA website states that inhaling ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase the risk of respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
The German pigs might have a party.
German pigs and cattle may be having a party as heavy rains threaten the yield of the second largest beef producer in the European Union, Bloomberg reports.
This year, weeks of rain before harvest may mean that the crop for the baking industry is fit only for animal feed.
"The quality of the content is far worse than in the past and worse than in 2015", said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German chickens may be fed to animals, twice the normal rate, Agravis predicts.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by the warm summer in June.
In July Germany was hit by a hailstorm, which has continued into August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is hampering harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet started harvesting, according to local harvest collector Ceravis.
"These are very difficult days", said Frank Deckert, a senior trader at Ceravis in Rendsburg.
Harmony in Everything - The Finnish Interior Design's Clever Pieces
The beautiful nature plays a part in the interiors of the brick houses, as the large windows provide wonderful views of the Saimaa coastline into many of the rooms.
At every step, the efforts of our northern neighbours to create homes that are both rugged and perfect (energy-efficient) are evident.
The Finnish people's skill in using wood as a building and finishing material, in the making of furniture and ornaments, deserves admiration and respect.
Both the builder and the designer of the (home) find inspiration and clever solutions in the brass houses.
It is evident that combinations of black, white, and gray shades, complemented by wood tones and house plants, can be very moody.
The best ideas will be popping for another week, because the fair runs until August 13th.
The utensils and the pots suggest that this kitchen is used for cooking.
Tonight, the line was drawn for the Weekend Festival Balticu, and Martin Garrix was doing his utmost to be the last performer to be remembered.
The crowd was really going wild during Garrix's performance - singing, singing, dancing to the beat.
When Garrix finished, the white mass spread from the beach to the city.
We're bringing you a gallery of all the pictures our photographer took over three days at the weekend.
I'm sure you're one of them, look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face off in the most exciting boxing match of the near future in the under-66.7 kg weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN Los Angeles office until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization lightweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision to defeat four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday night on Showtime, both winners are in the lead of the weight-for-weight division.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you doing, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko defending his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7:00 on ESPN.
While posing for a few photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noted that the possible confrontation between the two fighters would be "perfect balance".
"I'm a former shut-in", Garcia recalled.
"I've gained for Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move down below the lightweight.
And he's got to move up the lightweight, and then we can fight.
The fans have been asking for it.
Let's give it to them".
Lomachenko has agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight".
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be worth watching, as part of his strategy of having Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg division later this year, to make a possible encounter with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title match on September 23 at the Forum.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding, as fans have wanted this confrontation", Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offered the best financial package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name could attract this much attention.
Whenever they are ready"...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "great fighter" and might go watch his game on Saturday.
Lomachenko was modest in his praise of Garcia, however, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
Garcia said the goal was to show off the punch and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them as they tried to make it.
"This is a fight that is waiting to happen.
No other rivalry has attracted so much attention and so much attention.
I'm more than willing to work for it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
This is gonna be a good fight".
From what parts of the world do people move to Estonia?
The Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have travelled to Estonia, mainly for work, study or to visit family.
For example, when it was decided to issue temporary residence permits to 6702 foreigners, the number of temporary residence permits was 4928 in the Netherlands.
The agencies do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia each year, in recent years the number has been approaching 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 people received temporary residence permits in 2014, compared to 675 a year earlier.
According to the Statistical Office, the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens is in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than departed.
"The Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been large and, due to the difficult conditions in the country, it is natural that work and study opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead", said Kristin Rammus, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who received temporary residence permits in Mullu and Tunamullu was higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although in the last ten years, the maximum number of temporary residence permits was issued to the latter.
If Ukrainians come here to work, it's mostly Russian citizens for emigration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the strongest family ties with people living in Russia", said Helina Maasing, a field researcher at the Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received a residence permit in Estonia have moved to, then after Harjumaa there is Ida-Virumaa", he added, pointing out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu received a temporary residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to renew their residence permits decreased.
"The hype is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for to permanently settle in Estonia", explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in obtaining an Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable over the years.
Foreigners who have lived in Estonia for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for the purpose of settling permanently in Estonia for the previous year.
It's designed to encourage people who have adapted to stay.
A long-term resident's residence permit, for example, requires five years.
The renewal of the old residence permit has apparently also been reduced because of the new residence permit.
For example, in the past, 146 Ukrainians who had worked here for at least three years were granted residence permits.
Now Ukrainians can switch jobs and the Estonian state no longer has to keep track of whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became hugely popular, with applicants including those with a grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 persons were granted residence permits to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Greeks and the same number of Chinese.
The total number of such applicants is already 1,269 in the first half of this year.
In a decade, Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for residence in Estonia.
In 2007, when three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, there were 200.
Nigerians come here to study at universities.
Furthermore, Estonian universities are popular amongst Greeks, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has increased enormously thanks to the apprenticeships.
The rule is that where a community has been established, it is easier for others to join", added Rammus.
In the last ten years, two people from North Korea, as many from Laos and Madagascar have moved to Estonia.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If some 6,000 third-country nationals are granted residence permits each year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we add EU citizens, it leaves us at around one per cent", Maasing commented, saying that the figures were actually small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14,822 people emigrated to Estonia in total, and 13,792 emigrated from here.
This means that the immigration has exceeded the emigration for the second year.
Most of the new recruits are Estonian citizens, but more are among those leaving.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was down by 2000 people.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.

For Maria Tammeoru, however, the empty tomb of ideas is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can spend hours dreaming in a museum somewhere and admiring antique necklaces and necklaces.
If you do something with passion, you'll study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem uninhabitable to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much light you want in your life!
I have a friend who has a sauna full of haute couture dresses that I made.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and wear the red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses, and he does!
You can live your own life!
The artist cannot tell the difference between the bright events and the grey day.
It was this mentality that gave birth to the plan to bring high fashion to the countryside in Estonia, between the forests and the fields, to the people, to whom fashion often does not reach.
The collection of Mammu was presented at the fashion show Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where the royal parade filled the street with 45 models.
In Tallinn, people often pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shout bravo, stand up, want to shake your hand.
Most of the audience came to see the news, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like to feel like I'm on a hot summer day with my fashion sense.
We had a 50-meter-long red carpet in the courtyard, and a whole street full of beautiful dresses, and it seemed like there was no end to them!
Maria doesn't like the idea of a supermodel performing for a supermodel. She likes to bring ordinary women onto the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always been delighted to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a gorgeous dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my own show, always behind the scenes, giving things the final push of a hopeless perfectionist.
I can't stand to look at the room in peace.
Maria is the kind of designer who doesn't just want to be a model, but wants to be in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in my studio, and I do most of my own sewing.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you find out.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not just the design, it's the stylistics, the logistics, the organization, the organization, it's all about the day of one temperamental woman.
Those fanatical hours must be a lot for a fanatic.
I can't tell when my day is over, for me it's just a day of joy!
I'm very lucky, it's like a never-ending string of good luck: I do something nice, the person gets something nice, and the person gets compliments.
It's been said many times that there's magic in my dresses - they make you feel like a princess.
The richly embroidered satin threads that made Maria's talent famous overnight are still the signature of Mammu Couture.
Martin Mürsepp from the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian undergraduate tournament was now turned against us
I'm sorry, that's the end of my story.
The first thing I noticed was we couldn't get our table.
And when the table is so big, there is nothing to do", commented the Estonian U18 basketball players 61:75 behind Great Britain our only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev / Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the offensive line and got so many more hits because of it.
We were not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it struck.
Many of the British attacks were stopped in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up a defence.
But they were holding hands everywhere, and we couldn't get it together.
It's what threw the team off.
The opposite homework was better.
In the opinion of Mürsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to reduce the opposition's momentum.
In the final quarter, we had zero errors, but the opponents already had a few quick baskets.
The athleticism and the tight-knitness that had been our weapon in the lower-division tournament had now all turned against us.
Today we were powerless against their aggression.
The bricklayer was left alone with his ward in the Cave, Matthias Tassi.
In the tournament, the whole team can be said to be good, but so far, there's been one hitter.
Too bad you've never met such an aggressive opponent before.
Tass has always been confident and played his part today, but he seemed tired - he's carried quite a load.
But he made some very beautiful moves that I've seen in training before", added the instructor.
Terrible numbers: the girls' basketball team has dropped three-quarters of a point in the EM tournament...
The U18 age group not only attends the young men's EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, but the girls started their whole career in Dublin.
And Estonia's game against Poland, unfortunately, went into the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25-65, but after the third quarter, the score was 9:49, or until the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot off the gas pedal and that period was tied 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, the Estonian 4 threw a third-point...
And the Estonians hit two in the first two minutes of the first throw, then 25 in the second, then one in the third, then 21 in the third throw...
Perhaps in the nearly half hour, one of the 47 shots was fired.
Plus, I got two points for four free throws.
The number of balls was a reasonable number at the time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a throwing percentage of 33 and Estonia had a throwing percentage of 13 (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day, Portugal had to admit 83:56 to the advantage.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
This weekend, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine-fighting Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit to replenish their ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for their return to sea, and in doing so, give the crew members a chance to rest for a few days.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and to be ready for future historic mine-sweeping operations.
'Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and their joint training in local waters is a good indication of our integration with allied forces,' said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, the Chief of the Operations and Planning Division of the Navy's Chief of Naval Operations.
From 29 June, the 1st NATO Permanent Mine Action Group will be commanded by Latvian Navy Lieutenant Commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the group's duties from Estonian Navy Lieutenant Commander Johan-Elias Seljamaalt at a ceremony in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support ship LVNS Virsaitis, which is also operated by the group's command staff.
The Estonian Navy's minehunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO's Maritime Command, NATO's 1st Standing Anti-Mine Group is a rapid-response first-response readiness unit that the alliance can deploy to locations around the world within five days.
On August 4th-13th, the ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again become the site of the Birgitta Festival, which was started 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klasi.
According to Risto Joost (36), the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, the Birgitta Festival this year will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classics of opera, Traviata and Tosca, the ballet interpretations of the charming Bolero, the play Karlsson, and the planned production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio, The Seasons, by the same international creative team that brought Haydn's second masterpiece, Loomine, to the stage at Pirital in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival where the spell takes hold and never really lets go.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this upper and mystical environment makes the human soul ring and touches the human consciousness in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the Maestro's first-class shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the Special Class, it's been a big help.
He guided me through my entire apprenticeship and supported me in my early conducting career.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to continue his work.
The Class of Er has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it's all coming back to me.
It was great to join a team that knows how things work.
It was the great heart of the Special Class that gave me the strength to go on with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What would excite an audience at a street festival, what would you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet in the museum, written by Astrid Lindgren.
This is "Karlsson takes off".
And one curious nuance about this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this piece.
Apparently, he's had the Karlson character in his head since he was a kid.
Risto, how do you put up with all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have plenty of that.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions are not so much dependent on other people as on myself, on how I face each new day.
And that kind of mindful tone, that kind of positive attitude, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror every morning, that really boosted my happiness rate.
Especially now, in this week of the most important tests, I have been practicing it with great diligence, and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and elevates the tone.
It's not just a phrase.
I don't think people know half the things the universe has to offer them about their bodies, but everyone's discovering it for themselves.
Now, this is the big moment.
Do you have any rituals before you step on the conductor's stand?
Yes, it is. We have to change our clothes for something more comfortable.
It's this little moment of self.
But generally, yes, I don't get a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I like to actively interact with people, even before I step on the conducting podium.
But come to Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover for the not so great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the hilarious video of Risto with Jo!
New results of age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden published
In Sweden, a test was conducted on asylum seekers to assess their age using a novel approach to medicine, and the latest test results show that more than 80 percent of the subjects were assessed as being over 18, but not everyone is convinced of the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing at the beginning of this year.
The test was introduced to assess age more accurately in the asylum application process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
The Migrationsverket has so far sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the test subject "may be 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the person was "probably under 18".
The test is only used if the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics from the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute released the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 of these tests, it found that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed that he would turn 18 this year.
This method of medical age-assessment, which involves X-rays of the soft tissues and MRIs of the knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they went through puberty earlier or later than normal.
"I've had a lot of time to think about it, and I don't think the current measurement should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is highly unreliable.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of a child being misclassified as an adult is small.
The highest risk, perhaps around 10%, is if the person is a little under 18".

The 20-year-old Anna Maria Orel made her debut at the London Worlds in a beautiful 67.37 and finished in a respectable 18th place.
Orel was the youngest female javelin thrower in the World Championships, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to compete for medals in the future.
The fight went well and I got a good experience.
On the first attempt (64.80), I immediately made my average, on the second (62.80), I risked too much, and on the third (67.37), I was able to keep my head clear", Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my escape, and I'm very happy to have found it.
Anna Maria Orelli's MMi debut ended in a comfortable 18th place.
The rain didn't bother Oreste, because he's training all winter at the TCU stadium.
"I'm hardened", she said with a small murmur.
With the London Olympic Stadium almost packed, did Orel sense the people around him or was he able to shut himself off?
I get it, but in a good way.
Everyone says it's going to pay off. It does.
You can experience that when you're competing.
Orel confirmed that he is comfortable with his debut in the MMi and that he has many more good races ahead of him: "I came here this season with the 32nd or last result, finishing in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and I have MM's, that's all that matters.
I'm bringing in a lot of experience, and one of these days I want to compete for medals.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he was switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, after much prayer and reflection... "I say to you, the people of West Virginia,
The meeting was a time of rejoicing.
"This makes me a Republican tomorrow", Justice added.
"As your coach, I would say it's time to play another game".
Trump had earlier promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and that he inherited the coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better than work for it".
"After only 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history, the Governor Justice announcement is just the latest rebuke to a party that is completely unmanaged and unable to find a positive and unifying message", Ronna McDaniel, the RNC spokeswoman, told CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there are many people, there are many injured.
Urmet, who's on duty at the weekend medical office, told the Evening Post yesterday that they've had to give out a lot of the patches.
The creases and the scratches are basic, the warping and the slight falling.
And, of course, the headaches, the back pains, the leg pains.
Urmeti says that visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that's how problems come.
Medics have also had to treat a few visitors with major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and one leg break.
We have also done sutures when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, the larger ones we'll send to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the party doctors are asking for painkillers for the hangover.
Coe praised the Russian public for its honest apology over the doping scandal.
International track and field star Sebastian Coe praised what he called "Russia's honest apology" for the doping scandal, but said it was not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athletics figurehead Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's ban was correct and that he had a clear goal of fighting doping.
He apologized "to all the athletes who have been stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The Good Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself had acknowledged that they had been having a rather difficult time and that they were doing everything possible to reorganize the Federation".
The Commission also noted that the Russian authorities had not provided any evidence that the Russian authorities had provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Russian authorities had not provided the necessary information.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and there is progress, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the time to take back Russia", Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can over the next couple of months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a broken system", he added.
Nineteen Russian track and field athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF's working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several recovery criteria.
After a briefing to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still at large.
The electric car revolution is going to change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they're winning one place and losing another, it doesn't help the smaller mining companies.
Glencore is currently profiting from coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, there will be a growing demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel.
This year, the UK, France and Norway have all agreed to ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars in the coming decades, a move that will increase the share of electric cars.
That's why Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla is bringing a cheaper Model 3 electric car to market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, electric cars have been outselling cars with petroleum fuels for two decades.
"For some metals, this changes everything", Simona Gambranini, a raw materials analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We've already seen a big impact on metals like cobalt and lithium, which have been in demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times the copper content of conventional cars, Glencore reported.
The demand for copper at charging stations is even higher, which Exane BNP Paribas estimates will increase copper demand by around 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing electric car trend, from the rise in copper prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage firm, the two winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
The London Metal Exchange has risen by a whopping 70 percent this year.
The increase in the price of the bull was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share price rose 20 percent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in terms of price, which is a record.
On the losing side are lead-based companies like Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is the batteries supplying current to the starters of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found to have another purpose that can overcome the decline in demand", said Michael Widmer, head of analysis for the metal market at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the downward trend on the price movement of lead is not yet apparent.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it by far the best-priced metal among London's major industrial metals.
Investors see trouble for the metal in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps the regular cars competitive", said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager for Trilands Metals, a metal fabrication company.
When lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
It might be like this in about ten years.
In the meantime, however, stricter emission standards mean that there will be a growing demand for hybrid cars, which depend on lead-based batteries developed when the engines are frequently started, the International Lead and Zinc Research Organisation estimates.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, because lighter cars can travel farther on less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum demand of 1,6 million tonnes of aluminium for the period 2013 to 2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's total production of aluminium.
The trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year as increased demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel workers never sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce car bodies for automobiles.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also seeking to develop a lighter steel alloy to withstand the aluminium minimum.
'Over-hard steel should be the answer to this development', said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
Europe is seeing some success.
The end of the oil age could also bring suffering to the platinum.
About half of that precious metal was used to make diesel engines for car catalysts, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many commodities that are currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a commodity analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are less important, but their importance changes over 15 years.
The platinum producers believe that the demand for diesel hybrid cars will continue.
Uncore's CEO Marc Grynberg said that in 2025, hybrid cars will continue to outsell all-electric cars.
The big hope for platinum manufacturers in the 10 year perspective is hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motors, which rely on platinum to produce hydrogen-based electricity.
However, this technology has not yet proven itself commercially.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars", said Exane BNP Paribas' Brunet.
In July, German carmakers suffered a major setback when the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche in their home city.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, designed to prevent European football clubs from spending too much, will not prevent Neymar from making a world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever consequences may come from UEFA, the governing body of the European game, and the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League, will be with Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial terms of the fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Ney's move to the French club.
PSG certainly has the money to sign Neymar and add him to their roster of stars, given that the team is funded by the family that rules the Qatari energy market.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they must balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to make their fortune in football.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected as UEFA President in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that go into huge debts in search of success were actually engaging in fraud and risking ruin if banks or owners were to withdraw their support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring club losses rather than debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then spending big money to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, the clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite being disgraced in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is definitely not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future", Andrea Traverso, a UEFA FFP observer, told The Associated Press last week.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any evidence that the measure constitutes State aid.
The transfer fee is EUR 44,4 million per year for the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were the most severely punished.
The club was fined €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and was required to limit the number of players in the Champions League to 21 instead of the usual 25 for the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to circumvent the over-regulated financial institutions by blowing their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official revenue.
The Commission also found that the State aid granted to the club was compatible with the internal market.
It has been said that some of Neymar's services at PSG may come through Qatar's contributions to the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily uncover such a maneuver.
The previous penalties imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempts to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that they remain anonymous, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The French authorities have not provided any information on the amount of the compensation paid to the club.
The figures for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30% in connection with the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the biggest footballing stars, tried to block Neymar's transfer, claiming that PSG was breaking the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country", La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG being owned mainly by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, has warned La Liga that the state is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game, because the state may have other ways or other interests for such a big player to represent the state".
Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting on the plane's tail the pictures of those who have pushed the boundaries in their field and been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee
With the expansion of the geography of Norwegian operations, the circle of people earning their place on the flight deck has also expanded.
Among the selected individuals are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured), and Miguel de Cervantes, who are all members of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
But soon, one of the planes will be decorated with a portrait of Queen's legendary singer, Freddie Mercury.
50 years ago today, a hurricane-sized storm ripped roofs and windows from houses in Estonia.
The storm of the century, which struck on August 6 and 7, caused great damage, especially to Western Australia, the Harlem and Rapla Islands.
In northwest Estonia, the wind speed on these days was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one twisting tree to another in the garden, trying to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and gloomy, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the elderly Mrs Linda Kurova recalled an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus about the Haapsalus, where the roofs of houses were already flying.
Linda's husband saw his garden collapse.
But what do you do with your hands to support a tree to get through a storm like this?
The sea came down the window, the water came in through the windows", said Mrs. Linda Toona, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalus.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the parrot's roof of the railway station had flown 20 or 30 yards away was something Linda, like most of the people in the carcass, did not see until the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were all down, some lying flat, some half-hearted.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm was ripping through the beautiful old trees and cracking them like a war.
The West Virumaa region was not particularly badly affected by the August 1967 storm compared with the West Estonia region, but the damage was also extensive, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
The Lossi Park and the Padise Park were razed, but our parklands suffered greatly.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 80 miles [130 km] per hour, were measured.
On the evening of August 6, a little girl in the Tallinn town of Merivalla shouted: "Mom, mom!
The chicken is in the air and can't get down!"'
The Pólli mill building in Viljandim was so badly damaged by the storm that it was later decided to demolish it.
Augustorm was unable to withstand the construction of the Thur ski jump, which was later not restored.
The newspaper Red Star of August 12, 1967, reported that the clearing of the fallen trees and their branches in towns and villages is progressing slowly, and the inhabitants could join in the cleanup.
The orchards were also badly affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "the party organizations must be the inspirers and the guides both in the clearing and in the harvesting".
Hurricanes are defined as having average wind speeds exceeding 32.7 m/s.
The record for the strongest wind in Estonia is held by the wind of Ruhn, which reached 48 m/s on November 2, 1969.
The wind gauge on the island of Vaindloo broke, so the wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret to Clean Beaches: Nighttime Cleaning and Bad Beach Weather
The cooler summer weather also means less cleaning on Tallinn's beaches.
"When it's raining, there are people on the beach, and when it's not raining, there are no people", admits a beach cleaner.
The seagulls are howling on the beach at North Tallinn Stream.
Their melodic competition is provided by a low-speed tractor that drives down the beach.
In fact, the last one is sweeping through the sand from a depth of two and a half feet [7 cm], picking up seaweed and human remains - bottle caps, cigarette butts, and so forth.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is fine, there are people on the beach, and if it is not, there are no people", says Aleksandr Usov, director of the beach cleaners of the Haabersti Administration.
It's 6:30 and the beach is in a state of heavy cleaning because the beach has to be cleared by 8:00.
Usov's at the work post since 4:00.
Besides the Stream, he's keeping an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and the beach of the Paljasaari Pikakari.
Waste is reduced.
Years ago, it was much more.
People are already appreciating what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that if something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
They're already holding what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest jobs on the coast of Estonia is the cleaning of the beaches of the sea.
For example, on Pirita beach, 400,000 tons of this stuff has to be hauled off after the beach season.
"It is an incredible amount", notes Usov.
The second big category is junk, which is all that people leave behind.
On the one-and-a-half-mile stretch of Strome's shoreline, there are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much trash.
However, cooler summer weather has meant that the litter is one fifth less than it would otherwise be.
The third category is abandoned things.
Most of them are children's toys.
This time, Usov has dug dozens of model cars out of the sand.
They're waiting for their owners on the beachfront.
Usually, more of them come out, but this is a normal catch". Usov knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to be re-soaked in the sand.
The Garbage is Scattered
Erika Scholler, the representative of the Haabersti administration, admits that the tractor's malfunction is disturbing the locals.
The noise, which lasts from the night hours to the early morning, disturbs the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
But during the day, that's impossible.
You have to comb the beach twice in a month.
"If we don't do this, the city will fine us", Scholler notes.
But the aim is to get the Ström beach under the international blue seal of quality, just like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do to maintain its beaches", says Scholler.
We have more sawdust and rocks and harder sand to sift.
But there's less garbage on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is trashed, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, spontaneously joins the conversation between the journalist and the cleaners, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
In the morning, there's a whole mess of it.
The problem is the birds and the bottle-pulling men who have been dragging the garbage bags around", reports Martin.
While it is difficult to expect that people will be able to change their present behavior, Martin hopes that the city government will take action against the trash cans, for example by putting a lid on them to prevent at least the birds from reappearing there.
But overall, Martin is happy with the development of Strom's beach.
I can see the city is taking care of it.
With its playgrounds, its lighted roads, and its freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
"In the past, there was only one road where you could skate", Martin says.
Coins, only coins
The morning's noontime is used by 40-year-old Dimitri, who is a miner, combing the coastline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything worthwhile, now or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I have been doing this for a year and have not found anything of value", Dmitry reports.
Dmitri's hoard contains some euro coins, bottle caps and dangerous nails in a treasure trove, which he later throws in the trash.
There's usually coins.
"Gold, rings and the like are not common", says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their current levels as weak growth and a slowing of inflation have softened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as household income pressures have put interest rates on hold.
The Banking Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain, as inflation was still expected to rise to near 3% in the autumn.
The Bank also indicated that the rate increase would be necessary to control the inflation caused by Brexit over the next couple of years and that a higher than expected increase in borrowing costs may be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago to withdraw part of the mammoth package of economic stimulus triggered by Brexit.
The bank will end its fixed-term funding scheme in February, which provides cheap funding to banks, although it said it now expects a larger £15 billion offer under the scheme, which is £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank states: 'The MPC medium-term forecast for GNP will be ineffective in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will also affect consumption in the future'.
The Council reiterated that "some monetary tightening" was needed to reduce inflation, and that this was "somewhat more" than the markets expected.
The stock market is currently forecasting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and the next are comparable to the May forecasts of 1,9% and 1,7%.
The Commission also assessed the impact of the measures on the Union industry on the Union market.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make the adjustment is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have dampened growing expectations of an upturn - GDP rose in the second quarter to 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up a bit towards the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave households, suffering from rising inflation and poor wage growth, little cause for rejoicing, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it got better.
It added that monetary policy would not prevent a shock to incomes in the next few years, but that a significant recovery in wages was expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also being stimulated by the growing demand for British output, which is partly offset by lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the 0.25% rate was revised last August after the shock EU referendum that caused the sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to fully recover.
Before the bank's latest decision, there had been a growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on households in need; in July, three policymakers called for a rate hike of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared with 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth over the 2% target was entirely due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokerage Coreco, said: "In the light of the recent fall in interest rates, it appears that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders are eager to work and hope to end the year on a positive note.
The stock exchange seems particularly attractive to those whose current transactions are about to expire, as refinancing, often at no charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular.'
The NHS is prescribing an HIV drug that's been found to be incompatible with the drugs in 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September, after a court battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England announced that the NHS will now make available to an estimated 10,000 people a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablet, given before sex, in an initial three-year clinical trial that has shown an 86% reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a ruling last year by the Supreme Court that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the NHS's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England's chief executive, Simon Stevens, as a "new major intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics to be added in October before the programme is rolled out across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a class of HIV medicines that are taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before having sex means that there is enough of certain medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection.
These medicines may be taken every day or at least two hours before sexual intercourse.
People who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible people who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP in England can also register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international tender.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence about the target population and how it is consumed and administered in the large-scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new large-scale intervention should complement and reinforce the wider and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of the greatest health problems facing mankind".
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it's targeted correctly to those who need it and are at risk, offers the potential to turn the tide of the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, that is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: 'The priority now is to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is launched quickly and that no HIV-positive person is left out.
Now that the drug for the PrEP clinical trial has been found, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.
The Deputy Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: "The start of a PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very much overdue after months of delays and governmental foot-dragging.
The evidence shows the potential of this medicine to make a difference in preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people who have been exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society".
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while they fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the next-day electricity exchange price between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1,94 compared to EUR 7,71 in June of this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the Lithuanian-Swedish union's failures.
The average market price of electricity in Estonia last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour, up 12 percent from June.
Latvia and Lithuania saw a five per cent decrease in the price of EUR 36,27 per megawatt-tonne.
The price in Finland was EUR 34,17 and the system price on the Nord Pool electricity exchange was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 percent and seven percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity flowed 75 percent of the hours in the previous month in the direction of Estonia and 16 percent of the hours in the direction of Estonia.
The other nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not include the next day's transactions.
The electricity flowed between Estonia and Latvia 99% of the time and the transmission capacity was fully operational 73% of the time.
According to the transactions that took place on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the electricity exchange rate in August could be around EUR 34 per megawatt-tonne and in September EUR 37 per megawatt-tonne.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the electricity industry, has risen in the last month and transactions were made at prices of EUR 5.04 to EUR 5.47 per tonne.
The high-rise living - half-deck and clever designations have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate developer, traded her grand Knightsbridge home for the Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger area", Joanne said.
"I found something that would be worth my asking price.
I was shown this Earl Court apartment, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day".
Since the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands", he said.
She hired Erfan Azad from Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12-foot-high (3.8 m) floors to create a home that was not just a development, but a place where Joanne could live.
The stairs were not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-level where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to be creative.
"The metal construction is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It was not just a platform, but a steel construction to make both the upper and lower chamber the right height".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in the room, one after the other, with a wealth of dramatic elements.
On the ground floor, the vintage, copper-lit Retrouvius window opens onto the glamorous living space below.
The mirrored gold furniture, the silver details and the retro-angled lamps by Serge Mouille accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light-gloss.
The short corridor has mirrors at each end to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror on the back wall gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
The mirrored cabinet at the entrance provides a place for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The living room is enchanted by the ability to close off the kitchen when not in use, creating the illusion of a glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are not new.
What is unique about this kitchen is that it is a garage-type elevated door.
"It took some design work", explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced spoon-made MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, so it slides very easily when pushed up".
By wisely using space and storage, Joanne now has an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom, and a better floor plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you're selling - or what gives the property value", says Erfan.
"The real estate agent enters the room in an outdated form and calculates the floor area".
Here they have managed to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help to create an emotional bond with home", says Erfan.
"You don't love the electrical wiring on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart sing".
It shows that good design and increased space can help make something amazing out of a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they may even make you want to stay, as Joanne did.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper, a bounty hunter, who is competing with a colleague for a promotion.
It's all about the money you make, and then you forget all about ethics.
He sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late evening.
The first half of the movie, I'm struggling with the idea that this is the corporate version of House of Cards, even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech patterns are similar.
But as the film progresses, the less the ghost element and the more the filmmakers' moral intention becomes apparent.
The life-changing experience of a chief's son getting cancer.
Now we have to choose between work and family.
A son with dreams of becoming an architect makes his father think of the things that really matter when he walks by the great buildings of Chicago, like faith, kindness, love, not even the twin towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens the eyes of the father, it seems that the filmmakers have set out to make sure that the audience cries, because even the most compassionate viewer cannot hold back his tears when he sees the suffering of a dear little sick boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father finally realizes the morality of his work and does a kindness to the old man looking for work.
Now I'm betting on myself that if the movie is a happy ending, I'll reward my acumen with a coffee after the movie, but if I'm wrong, the writer can thank me for at least one surprise.
For a moment, you doubt you'll be without coffee when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes slowly down the hall to the palace.
But the son has made a remarkable recovery, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is a positive development because it is now time to deal with the family.
I can feel good about myself, too - I can predict the end of the American drama pretty well!
The truth is, the film is well constructed, all the elements necessary for it are there.
You can laugh, you can cry, the actors are good, the morals are good, money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will make a lot of money.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it for real.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that this will keep the boss in the dark.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day in office, he brought up the key problem President Donald Trump had in the White House that he planned to solve - the flow of bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that information must flow through him, whether in print or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information".
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it and they've failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits haven't gone anywhere.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also being honestly covered in the influential publications", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits, according to six former campaign workers, is to ensure that his personal media consumption consistently includes the eulogy".
- I'll see you.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits were once "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the texts that Trump didn't post.
If his aides were able to save him from trouble once or twice, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from continuing to stir controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing cliques, people are trying to advance their own interests by giving Trump material that supports their worldview, but may not always be credible.
Politico, which has been covering the story since May, wrote about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of strategic value.
One example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is this:
"Current and former Trump aides say Trump can react to negative press, especially damaging leaks, explosively by taking it upon himself to reveal their source.
So did it in late February, when someone gleefully handed the president a printed copy of an article on GotNews.com, owned by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source of numerous leaks" to the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter for defamation or that he didn't provide any concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and then retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "have been trying to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump".
How did it happen?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad don't get permits to perform in the capital.
There are a lot of foreigners in Tallinn's downtown.
Those contacted by the Evening Standard have all admitted to playing in the Old Town without permission from the city.
The first thing we found near the Viru gate was three street musicians who had brought the same number of dogs.
It was clear that the musicians in their Rastafarian hats and ragged clothes were backpackers who could use a shower for a change.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the group played a playful, rhythmic tune on the accordion, while a man next to her juggled three balls and invited passersby to come closer.
A third man was sitting on a backpack next to them, smoking a homemade cigarette.
Their three dogs did not allow the passing crowds to disturb them.
Noemi, playing the accordion, and Bob, juggling the balls, said they were playing music in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the performance was to collect money for a ticket to the ship to Finland that same evening.
When asked if they had asked the city for permission to perform in the Old City, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two and most of the time, they give us permits for a month or so.
There's no point in paying for it", Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru gate about 20 minutes later, we saw two women with the musicians and they were driving them away.
The gang moved with backpacks and dogs to the Viru downtown crossroads to try their luck.
Three young Polish men also performed on Viru Street, one playing the violin, another the clarinet, and the third even bringing an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and living", explained Mivosh, the trio's pianist.
Mivosh says they're aware that they have to get permission from the city to perform.
"Of course we don't have that", he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try", he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million under the public sector asset purchase programme for euro area central banks, bringing the total of the central bank's bond portfolio to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
In response to a question from members of the Riigikogu, Hardo Hansson, President of the Bank of Estonia, previously explained that the asset purchase programme of the Eurosystem central banks comprises three different purchase programmes: covered bonds of the financial sector, asset-backed securities (ABS) and public sector debt securities (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest elsewhere.
The effect of the purchase is to reduce the return on lower risk assets and to motivate investors to take higher risks.
In general, each central bank purchases its own government bonds under a public sector bond purchase programme, and no other national bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds meeting the purchase schedule is limited.
Eesti Pank generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, with the approval of Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
The Commission therefore considers that the acquisition of Elering's bonds by Eesti Pank is imputable to the State.
The Central Bank of Finland (Swedish: Centralbanken i Finland) has been buying Elering bonds and Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks since June.
The travelers ignore the trench and return to the "millionaire's district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have been thrown back into a furious confrontation with determined squatters who have ignored the council's dug trench to win back the land away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer homes in the wealthy "millionaire's area" off Solihull Road.
They have returned with an army of horses, children, and wagons after having been driven out of the country, without allowing themselves to be dragged into the ditch dug by the council to stop their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the defensive lines, squeezing their vehicles through the unobstructed section that was left for pedestrians.
Angry residents have denounced the Solihull Council as "useless in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved in on Monday night after their escape from Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at passers-by.
The council must be shamed to get them to act, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The Pilgrims were there, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came last night, probably more today".
He added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this sort of thing, by procuring long barriers to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the council fees when the council can't even stop something like this".
A local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous, we just saw the last of these pilgrims leave and there's already another outbreak.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even seen a horse".
A Solihull council representative said: "We are aware that the land near Streetsbrook Road is an unacceptable campsite and we are working with Solihull Police to implement the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It would be very helpful in collecting evidence if as many local residents as possible would report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This will help to give the court a picture of the situation when we present the case to them".
Amongst others, the Weekend Festival will be attended by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased that we have been able to bring the real world's best names to Estonia.
To the question why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, Saar replies that this should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival for three days at a time.
But he'll find that the real experts have come to Pärnus.
"Looking at the level of artists brought to Estonia, it's not often that the absolute best of this genre are brought home", says the Minister of Culture.
But which artists at the festival talk about the island itself the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, certainly one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
"We all have been through a lot of things", he says.
But he'll come up with a bunch of names, like the Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
And of course, our own Estonian actors, starting with NOËP, and there's a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high", he says.
Look at the video of the Evening Standard!
Audi is upgrading up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the midst of a crisis with automakers.
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", said the BMW chairman, referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would be retrofitting three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these operations as recalls.
European carmakers have been promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States with enthusiasm to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise the airborne emissions of diesel vehicles is also increasing for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under intense scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of appeasing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of, so to speak, fraudulent devices that allowed the exhaust to be adjusted to meet regulations when the car was tested, but which were retracted in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit of Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
The former head of the Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation in Germany involving Volkswagen, when authorities accused Audit of installing the system to circumvent European emissions requirements, expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could be a major blow for Volkswagen - the luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The European Union is buying 20,000 euros worth of flags for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the European Union flag for the Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
In total, 570 educational establishments measuring 105x158 cm will receive the European Union flag.
The flags are intended for indoor display and must be printed using high-quality printing techniques, including in-house printing, the ERR news portal informs.
The plaque on the flag reads: 'A gift to the schools of Estonia to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is €20,000 according to the Ministry of Education, or €35 for one flag.
Murder of journalist highlights growing danger in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meets on Wednesdays to review plans to contain the latest chaos in Sinaloa state, caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and the unrelenting drug war.
But today, they're gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two parent journalists are discussing which seems safer: bringing their children to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board in front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names for each column - no proof needed, just impressions and insides.
Suspected government or cartel employees include drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists - a list of all those who make the coverage of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and the more bodies accumulating across the country, the greater the number of journalists who are being killed - according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
Among the last to die was their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence can be felt everywhere - a large picture of Valdez with his middle finger and the words "Truth" hanging on the Riodoce building facade, and two 30-something reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his signature panama hat.
The meeting is less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although a separate State Prosecutor's Office was created in 2010 to handle cases involving journalists, only two cases have been brought to justice according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders per year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, killers of journalists rarely go to trial.
Riceodo continues to chronicle the violence in Sinaloa, though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now more dangerous.
Without the murderers' files and justice, Ibarra says, there's not much point in a security meeting.
"It's a very foolish thing to waste your time in a meeting", he says.
"Until you know the reason, you don't trust anyone".
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital, Culiacán, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla, forced him out of the car, and shot him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates to "twelve rivers".
A gunman drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are running free in Culiacán.
But the main thing about Valdez is that it's mostly quiet.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions battle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn't matter if a few people are shot in the streets of Sinaloa every day or even more, or if the graveyards are crammed with lavishly decorated double mausoleums of drug lords, larger than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that peacetime refers to when a maritime state with valuable ports and narcotic shipping routes to the United States is run by a single cartel.
Despite all this, and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels a tremendous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the boss of a warring cartel that rivals Guzman's sons.
This piece may have angered the shopkeepers - suspicious gang members bought all copies of the issue as soon as they reached newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a newspaper report that covered the same story was hacked.
A legend in Mexico and abroad, his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would live forever.
He was working as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling shares for $50 each.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the drug problem".
Over time, the paper gained notoriety for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish powerful investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers were captivated by a print that gave them stories no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) for her courage to follow the Mexican drug industry wherever it went.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live", he said as he accepted the AKC award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You must accept the responsibility that comes with journalism - the other option is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was happening".
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, the joker who snored like a sailor, the friend who gave warm hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to survive.
They were relying on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office and always sat at that table.
Now they're asking if his routine love life was fatal.
His death has also left them wondering how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like you messing with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used for drug trafficking".
"These things were not to be touched", said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, is intense self-censorship and self-loathing.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
The problem, says Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the sense of smell can be fooled... and that is what happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they no longer apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to a toxic mix of smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where Riodoce employees gathered for security training was suddenly no longer allowed to have mobile phones; a few days before, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two policemen outside the house were seeking relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's offices, which are in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacán.
Some reporters were left wondering if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself has branded untrustworthy.
It's been many months since reporters have been traveling to the mountainous countryside where the drug gangs are de facto in control.
Riodoce's issue this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
And they had a revealing story about the government spending money on the governor's home town.
And a group of people were robbed from the prosecutor's office in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block away.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so I had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knew - the restaurant is a favorite of drug dealers and law enforcement alike.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant is registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which has dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in widely publicized court cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to report on previous incidents in the same area, including how the son of Guzmán, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"We should have known what happened by now", said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose slender build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication with our sources is cut off".
Valdez's office has become a repository for the posters and stickers that protest the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they never expected - activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some flyers and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to protest another journalist.
Adame Salvador went missing in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt body has been found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become vocal and organized protesters chanting "SOS press" on the sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa, accusing the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from covering the government's activities, concerned that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "confined" by organized crime, by corrupt government officials, and by the average society.
In his latest book, "Drug Literature", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug cartels, but also by politicians and security forces, who are in the organized crime sphere.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they try to silence you", Ramirez said.
The murders obviously have a blood-curdling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, presumably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, that read, "I'm here for my reporting".
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of its correspondent, Miroslava Breach, in March.
Others will let it go, as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly to the drug cartel with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a nerve-wracking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to watch the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are persecuted, as was presumably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four other women in a Mexican apartment in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and work must dance around the risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that being a narcotics reporter frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
On a recent Friday at midnight, with the latest number already locked, Riodoce editors were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office, sipping beer, when suddenly everyone's phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in a shootout between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to spread, as many cartel messages found in the area indicated.
From the side of the sealed road, reporters were using cell phones to upload the news to the Riodoce website.
The next day's cover needed a change.
Sirens waving in the area.
Bojorquez peered at the policemen on duty to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the now-dead founder's massive portrait, with his middle finger visible throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees were following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think about closing", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to cover the streets?"
The dinosaur used a defensive paint to avoid its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a figure, although it's quite frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings of the incredible size of a rhinoceros discovered in a Canadian pit, so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that its skin, covered with scales, was a reddish-brown color and that its past had been somewhat "funny".
A report in Current Biology magazine described the creature as "the best- preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation has fascinated scientists who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to National Geographic magazine, this armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its type ever found.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was digging in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was done to dig the animal out of the 2,500-pound [1,100-kg] earthen floor.
After all this hard work, the final result is finally ready to be presented to the public.
"A little wink can almost make you think it's sleeping", said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
By examining its skin, researchers found that this herbivore, although covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by a significant number of flesh-eating dinosaurs.
This feathered dinosaur used red and white as a protective color to hide from predators, and it employed a technique called "shadow hunting", also used by many modern animals.
This, experts say, allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid enemies, since larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt it.
This 110-million-year-old creature of the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrellian Museum of Palaeontology.
The scientists have now studied the animal and named it Borealopelta mark after Mark Mitchell, a museum laboratory worker who was part of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering the animal.
Thanks to the remarkable preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the spores on the animal's body.
They discovered countershading, a common defensive mechanism in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper side of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although the shadow has spread, the findings will come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is considerably larger than the shadow-bearing animals living today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted actively enough by other non-meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution preferred to hide as a survival tactic rather than confront it.
But most modern-day counter-shadow animals, such as deer, zebras, and armadillos, are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nodosaur had to fight to survive.
"The vigorous pursuit of an unusually large and bearded dinosaur shows how dangerous predatory animals could be from Cretaceous dinosaurs", said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the fins also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal to uncover clues about its life, including the contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur died when it fell into a river, and then into the open sea, where it sank back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as present-day South Florida, and rivers and oceans likely extended farther inland than they do today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved arm-like skin, while remaining three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape", said Brown.
"As a result, the animal looks almost exactly as it did in the Cretaceous.
It doesn't take much imagination to reconstruct it - just a blink of an eye and it looks like he's asleep".
The Cretaceous was a time when the Earth was inhabited by huge, bipedal, scavenging, carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, this armed dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long (11.5 meters) beast that weighed six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings were published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta died out after being washed out of the sea and mummified in the mud.
The Olevus was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and it's complete from the conus to the hip bone.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long squirrels emerged from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this scaled herbivore ventured through what is now western Canada until an overflowed river flooded the open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve its magnificent detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the cranial arrow plates along the dinosaur's skull are still covered with skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "Selline's shelf life is as rare as a lottery ticket.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The calcified remains of the skin still cover the crusty armour plates on the animal's skull.
The right forefoot is lying beside him, with the five toes pointing upward.
I can count the arrows on his shoulder".
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in complete shock.
Just one day after his trip to New York, this St. Louis resident was sitting in a bed he rented through Airbnb, looking at Facebook on his phone.
He stumbled upon a post from a former schoolmate.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old and he's still lying in the street".
He was confused why no one else had posted this information to his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened up Twitter.
The posts from @TheePharoah's Twitter feed were shared repeatedly on his timeline.
A St. Louis-area rapper has been broadcasting live on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later that night he saw another telegram, this time about a gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of police officers and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another officer is said to have fired a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals".
Ferrell remembers thinking to himself, "This is unusual".
"This is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we would call typical".
I felt horrors in that moment.
I was angry and I cried".
She booked a return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive to Ferguson the next morning, just the two of them.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary Whose Streets? which opens in theaters August 11th.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who are meeting the demands of the streets.
As Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, they again discussed the subject that had come up repeatedly before that morning - the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Remember when I taught you how the black community should fight for their rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right".
"I couldn't help but take her", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He has to know it and see it and grow up in the midst of it.
She needs to learn about activism and organizing, and also about the layers of black experience and living conditions and what we need to do to be free and to free ourselves.
Even if I can raise her without racial prejudice, she's no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice if I was protecting her from this world".
The first stop they made on their way to Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, across the road from the police station, in what had become a sort of campsite, where activists waited for news of police officer Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9/11, " he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minority Student Union and focused on food rights and health inequities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all just a flashback".
Weeks later, during a dinner protest, Ferrell met with the co-director of a film, Sabaah Folayani.
Folayan said that he and the cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
The question that came to Ferrell's mind was, "Are you trying to document what's going on or are you trying to find a story that can be exploited?"
His skepticism was due to the innumerable instances of people, often white, coming into the community and trying to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had already shook hands with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement made the project a liaison for Ferrell and six other locals, whom the "Whose Streets?" crew had been tracking for years after the shooting of Brown.
"In that documentary, nobody speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves", Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that's how I was portrayed".
Although the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not "led by a revolutionary, but by a community coming together", as Folayan put it - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets? documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", said Ferrell, laughing about the first time he saw a finished film.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people had to come with a certain vulnerability".
Furthermore, Ferrell's story highlights and re-emphasizes the role of the average black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who came up with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media in the wake of the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin are gay.
"Black gay women in leadership roles have held the movement together", Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black lesbian women have to carry all this burden".
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women".
He also argues that "there is no such thing as equal opportunity" - Ferrell was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man with a real energy", she said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line, "because as a black gay woman living at such junctures,
His energy can be felt through the screen".
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but the racial ties between the community and the police are still tenuous.
The probation imposed on Ferrell for blocking the highway during the demonstration will continue for another two and a half years.
He describes the social and political atmosphere in the area he calls home as simply "the valley".
Still, he holds to the mantra he's memorized since he first took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
7 Tips to Overcome the Pumpkin After a Weekend Party
Some of our toughest guys find that after a drunken party, it's all about the help.
Or they're from the saying "go to the pits, stay drunk".
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent shot to the health.
What can you do to make sure that after the weekend trolley - or any other party - you feel better in the morning and that you get over the bump as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Alcohol before and after, after the big party in the morning... or even in place of alcohol if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid from alcohol, it must find a way to regain it.
Mineral water is also excreted from the body, and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since stomach irritation is common after a sip, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only lightly aerated.
Go for a walk.
You would not want to go to your grandmother's house with a spade to chop down trees - it could be a fatal mistake.
But a gentle walk helps your body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and taking the powder is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the energy back to the body slowly and gently.
If you're gonna throw up from last night's overeating, you don't want to try to load up a big fat steak.
Start with fresh juice, for example, which contains fruit sugars that will quietly inflate your body.
If you're sick down south, you might try some broth.
And then a little later, backwards.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will rid your body of any water left.
Like I said, water and salt are your friends.
Don't put yourself on the painkillers.
If you take painkillers to prevent hangovers in the evening, your liver has to deal with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and it loses its ability to function.
You'll damage your liver even more, and the future of the bumps will be even worse.
Besides, the painkiller doesn't last long in the body anyway.
If you take painkillers in the morning, do not do so on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already sore stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you can get along with yourself.
It's about the same effect as walking, but walking doesn't give you an orgasm.
Avoid too vigorous pace and repetitive poses - your physical effort should be moderate during the stutter.
Make a joke about it.
Do silly things with fellow reporters, make simple jokes, and laugh amiably at yourself and at others.
Laughter and laughter may not make the swelling go away, but they certainly make the aftermath more fun to bear.
One day the bottle will pass anyway!
A Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects in the murder of
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and a Oxford University employee who have become suspects after the discovery of the body of a man with fatal stab wounds in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County court records, warrants were issued Monday without bail for the arrest of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged connection to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police responded to a call and found a victim with multiple gunshot wounds on the front of the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public affairs, said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem is now temporarily suspended and barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior lecturer in the finance department at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been in contact with the UK police and stand ready to assist the US investigative agencies in any way possible".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications for the Chicago Police Department, is urging suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have a clue where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to determine the exact location", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmo said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police got a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic tip that something was going on in 1008.
According to the police description, it was a sighting of a stray.
Guglielmi claims it's unclear whether the event itself happened on July 27th.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair", added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to the residents, saying, "The police department is currently working to establish the chronology of events and the victim's background, and is investigating various motives, including the possibility of a domestic disturbance".
Businesses that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were unsuccessful.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, misleading.
And even though he promised anonymity, some of the staff didn't trust the process.
"The system just wasn't consistent and objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco.
So he called in outside help.
There's a new type of human resource startup that's emerging that helps companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the explicit purpose of measuring employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct in-depth interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases allow disruptors to bypass C-level managers and go directly to management.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools companies use to measure employee engagement.
Errett says that in the three years he has been using Glinti, he has gained a much better understanding of what his employees are thinking and feeling.
In addition to the crash tests and surveys targeting specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the highest complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to explain the reasons.
Companies are starting to realize that they need to stay current with their work culture so they don't become the next Uber, which has been plagued by scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassment environment where those who dared to speak up were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, has seen an increase in interest and activity this year, amid Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercenti has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glintk, Convercent lets companies send customized pulse queries, collect confidential real-time responses and look at heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous hotline for employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO gets involved, complaints go straight to the board.
"Public opinion has hijacked regulatory agencies", said Convercenti's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee layoffs and lawsuits, even if regulators don't intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercenti for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address of the corporation's headquarters, make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frustrating and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
Now that a company is using Convercenti, however, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that were not previously addressed by managers in other cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of the employees", said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we defend our partners from litigation with employees".
Quinlan said companies started taking ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after the Arthur Andersen audit firm went bankrupt for ethical violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until social media matured that companies realized they couldn't stop laundering their dirty laundry in public online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies periodic fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capitalists who have been a support to both startups.
Convercenti was funded in February by $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising $47 million in capital.
Glinti invested $10 million in November with Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising, given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today's workers expect more from their workplace than ever before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are dedicating their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel heard and feel that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of public benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercenti and Glinti.
Investors earn revenue when the companies in their portfolio do well; companies do well when employees are engaged and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it is no wonder that they find support.
The possession of data on employee involvement is important to work culture experts.
But that data is useless unless the company inspectors do something about it.
In fact, asking employees for feedback can create expectations that change is coming.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or at all, this can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business management firm, who has seen how companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't get things done, the employees are like, 'Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who now conducts six-monthly surveys of employees, was able to take action the same day the problem was reported to Glin.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
But Ruby Tuesday is collecting new data on employees and hopefully in the long run this will result in a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry that is known for its high workforce turnover.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're losing people", said Vitrano.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses".
The bright spot for the euro area is the Baltic: revenues are rising fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade issues with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic states, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, citing a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success of the EU is due to its low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and business- and freedom-friendly policies.
'The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita has significantly approached the EU average in terms of purchasing power,' the central bank said.
Although the aim is to achieve a per capita GDP that is on a par with Western Europe, in 2015 the per capita GDP of the Baltic economies was only two-thirds of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the EU before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led Bulgarians to look abroad for better wages.
Although the European Central Bank has a positive view of the Baltics and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian citizens consider their economies to be doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought so about their economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the two-a-day practice will make the Bruins' days long.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. when a troupe of UCLA football players stop for a chat at the edge of the team's new training field on campus.
Some of them have ripped off their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs from the first day of training camp.
For much of the crew, these power minutes provide a midday break.
After three hours of training, the players attending the summer courses return to the common area to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman football stadium for their meetings at 6.30 the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real test for them", said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the twice-a-day practice to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are half over on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the tight schedule of the players.
The transition from two training days to one training day means more training days - the start of the Bruins training camp was moved up by almost a week compared to the previous season and for the first time Mora trained during the six Westwood summer courses during the season.
They have 18 practices scheduled through August 20th before they officially begin their preparation for the September opener against Texas A&M.
Mora says he's in favor of the NCAA rule change, even though it adds another agenda item to the tight schedules of the players.
"They have a huge load in three or four days and it's a serious challenge", Mora said.
"And they're grinding through this ordeal; they're working hard, they're fine young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice".
Once camp is over, UCLA will make the practice a nightmare, which is no easy task given the clear view of their pitches from the adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lusk Center, a high-end hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped the goal post's security net.
The Bruins have been hiring players from this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be problems with the available rooms during the offseason.
"We're going to put in security measures", Mora said.
"This is a real concern, and it's not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film the training from there.
If you have a recording of your workouts, you can make a pretty good deal.
But we're using security there and in the 8th parking lot.
Let's make the best of what we have.
I try not to worry about it too much.
We have a plan in place".
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was created in revenge for Keskerakonna, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and EKRE, who was forced to leave after the merger of Maria Kaljuste's forces, and the businessmen's electoral alliance, Our Tallinn and Tegus Tallinn, which was created to show the party members what was happening in the party politics, appear to be participating in this year's local elections as much as the political parties.
But the ticks are counted in the fall, and the key question becomes whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying at the Savisaar?
How small Edgar Savisaare's support base has shrunk, one can only guess at the events his electoral alliance has organized.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and current centrists and many unknown faces - is this how the electoral alliance will be put together?
And is the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaar are avoiding running in Tallinn, the fact that the "Savisaar list" of kidnappers, headed by corrupt candidates and suspects of corruption, is becoming a reality?
The music video for the Russian-language pop song, filmed on the roof of the city hall, with the participation of the mayor of the city of Lasnamäe; and the original computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid the squirrels and the squirrels that hit the road while riding on a bicycle - is this how Keskerakond is attracting the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to vote for the first time?
We'll see how the other parties feel about a youthful campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are shown a black box instead of entertainment programmes from the beginning of August, they have two options: accept that in future they will only see ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinna TV and the English-language France24 channels in free-to-air mode, or give up their TV rights to a certain operator every ten months.
There are probably also those who at first openly rejoice in the ad-free experience but who end up - albeit grudgingly - paying for the TV and the ads.
Distracting music, noisy crowds, and trash left in the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost any major music festival.
But if you don't want to be a part of the noise, instead of worrying about your home, you might want to explore the countryside and leave the sleeping quarters for the festival guests for a hefty fee.
Changes the rules of the green card in Washington.
The media is quoting President Donald Trump as saying that a new immigration plan is in the works that will change the rules for green cards.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per 50,000 people per year, stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and the president is supporting them.
The bill will now pass both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars of taxpayer money by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain of custody and replace the current program.
The new application process gives a preference to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy", Trump was quoted as saying by US media outlets.
Siberian young people move to the city, retired people back to the countryside.
Anatoli Yevseyev continues the tradition of the gold miners of the famous settlements of the Main River.
He works as a driver in a gold mine on the Kuwai tributary of the Mana River, about 90 miles [140 km] from his home.
It's hard work: two months without days off, 12 hours of work, only 10 days at home, and then back again.
In three years at Artell, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There is a strict order: when you enter, you check carefully to ensure that you do not bring wine, and when you leave, you do not bring gold", says Anatoli.
Mare Piho is chatting with local uncle Jan in Haida village, who has told her much about his family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of the Siberian sediments will begin to affect even the home-sediments, for it is simply so stupendous, that it is thought most thoroughly studied by the distant sediments of the Piho Mare.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first exploration in Siberia.
During that time, he visited the temple 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many widows did, however, go out to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
It's an open question.
I'm going to say 8,000.
I calculated it from the stories of the Siberian seto men who have thought it themselves.
It's hard to say exactly, because back then, you could have up to 30 people in a group, but the passport was only given to the husband.
Only one of them got a passport, but they had kids, sisters, cousins.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times larger than the historic Setoma.
It had to be educated, managed somehow.
The Setos came here as farm boys, but their lives changed because here they were in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (wage farming), to gold mining, to industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many of the workers later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (the J.P. plant was built there by the Soviet government) when it was established.
Were the herds the majority of the population in this area at that time?
Yes, they lived in compactness.
In addition, the tradition of intermarriage and of having many children was long maintained.
Seven or eight children in a family was common.
How different was the culture of the Siberian sedge from that of the mainland sedge?
They're different, though what brought them here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of commoners.
They did it themselves, but they always distinguished between what was brought in and what was done here.
Climate change has had a big impact on traditional clothing in the Setou, because it's colder here.
The food has changed.
For example, in Setoma, the meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian sedge villages and how do they live? / graphic by Alari Paluots
The bond with the motherland was strong spiritually, and this was considered very important.
I think it's starting to affect them.
These girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the delegation of people from the Seto Kingdom of Estonia who came to Haida in early July for the Day of the Kingdom of Seto and spent four days at home. - J. P.
What's left of it is amazing.
"It is very easy to get to and from Tape, because the city is located in a great location: at the junction of the railway and the intersection of the highways", says Reigo Tamm, a resident of Tape.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural venues and pizza is everywhere.
Kill is a top-to-top town!
There is a small island where the butchers hold their annual festival.
"This beautiful place is not visible from the train window", Reigo mutters.
If you're not afraid of the cold water, you can swim in it, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming in there, I can do it!
On the riverbank, you can have a picnic and just have a romantic moment, you can look at the river flowing and think about life going back and forth.
I've been there with my girlfriends.
Tamm, an opera singer, has, among other things, gone to the riverbank between the three bridges to rehearse his arias: "Since this place is on the edge of town, no one will probably object to my singing the stories".
"From the top of the mountain, you have a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health bars where you can run, ski in winter and now, for example, play disc golf - golf courses are built, boards can be borrowed from the sports centre", says Reigo.
Of course, the old pros go there with their disks, but I haven't gotten to play there yet.
I think we should invite our colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale to the party, because he's an experienced disc golfer and he has some chips.
He's the one who's lending me money!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during skiing lessons.
There's been a lot of tears, disappointments and victories on this mountain in my sports career.
Not to mention the broken pulleys and the ski slopes.
"The whole city centre is now full of construction, all of it is changing into the unknown", says Reigo.
But the old, tired vaccine building is a very attractive place to play summer games.
I'm glad that in 2012 the director of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although the street theatre season with "Aleksei Karenini" has just ended, on August 11th, the train station will have "Elluärkamine", as the old vacation house moves around in the 1980s.
"The 11th-13th of August is the 'Tapa City Days', where the vaccination centre is reopened and where there are many cultural events, including a rally", says Reigo, who is planning to visit the 91-year-old town in just a few days.
The little yellow house has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are plentiful and the information is vast", says Reigo, a site full of history in Tapa, much of which focuses on the railroad and the military.
Reigo says if Tappal goes to all the recommended places, he'll get hungry, but luckily the small towns are full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sometimes sitting in cafes feels like being in a foreign country", she explains.
The educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in the pubs, so it's a strange feeling to sit there and feel like you're in Estonia and in your hometown, but there's this international community around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Yes, we have a lot of movement!
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry announced that two Bulgarians had been detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, on the Sithonia peninsula.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation going on.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught camping in an unintended place.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry says the court can impose a fine.
The wolves that train the cubs come and break the sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers in the hive must again provide the wolves with "training material" from their herd - apparently the wolves that trained the cubs have already broken a number of the sheep.
This year, wolves have attacked sheep in the county three times, injuring eight of them and leaving 23 sheep in the wild.
I only had a number three, and a year ago, it was 124.
The breakthrough coincides with the Environment Agency's data that no wolf nests were born on Hiiumaa and the Hiiumaa Hunting and Conservation Council's information that two wolf nests were recorded on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves broke into 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the province of Emmaste, injuring half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves in the pasture of the village of Rehesel and herd broke one sheep and seriously injured another, which was to be euthanized.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Environment submitted to the Coordination Circle the Draft Amendment Act on the Environmental Management of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the Act will remove the need for a separate database for both the location of genetically modified (GM) crops and the operators, which will be used in the future as a plant health register.
In addition, the obligation for the GM farmer to have a prior agreement with the person responsible for beekeeping within the prescribed radius is amended.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently grown in Estonia, we believe that there should be clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it is decided to declare Estonia GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"It is also necessary to take into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens incurred by both the private and public sectors", added Mr Suu.
The Bill repeals the provisions on the data collection and training of GM crops in the GMOVS, and establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and the start of economic activities.
With regard specifically to honeybees, the existing obligation of the GM crop farmer to inform the beekeeper when GM crop is started is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the crop.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and, if they wish, to submit their comments to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect in particular persons active in the field of plant production, the beekeepers and the Agricultural Office.
Only one GM crop, maize MON 810, is allowed to be grown in the European Union, including Estonia.
However, no Estonian farmer has so far shown any interest in growing GM crops.
The reason is that there is no maize pest in Estonia, the European maize moth, to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, this maize line has been bred for the southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate.
In order to ensure this, the Ministry of the Environment has ordered in 2015 and 2016 studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of suviraps, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The analysis results of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of the rapeseed, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
The above, in turn, indicates that no GM crops are being deliberately grown in Estonia and that no accidental contamination has been confirmed.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed Nemanja Maticu as a "genius" after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40million signing from Chelsea started in Dublin in United's final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in a 2-1 first-leg win, impressing in a defensive role as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given free-kick shots.
However, after missing the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia, Maticul narrowly missed out on a match-winning form and lasted just 45 minutes, which Mourinho said would have to be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, the intelligence, the genius mindset - he has the footballing spirit", said Mourinho.
"Let's get him in shape as soon as we can".
Like Matic, the Aviva Stadium was also the starting point for the other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, and Mourinho quietly began to put his 11th man in place for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "great job" signing three of his four priority picks.
'I am grateful to the clubs for being able to realise three of the four,' he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make it four, but they've worked hard for me".
Another one of my nephews was hit by a GSM transmitter on August 1st, and that time in Muhus.
According to resident birder Mati Martinson, the first clock-equipped male was born in the village, and the nest is already flying around, has left the nesting site, and has joined the large night-time colony of the Mullutu-Suurlahe.
That's because there's no crops in the Finger, writes the Voice of the Isles.
That Tuesday, relatively late in the day for a son of a bitch to be hanged, another son of a bitch was hanged on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of the tracks is actually an international project, led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
A courier named Mullu was equipped with a Mat GSM transmitter in the Throat of Death.
'Everything about him is on the internet: how he went to Spain for the winter, came back for a while, stood on the German-Polish border and then came to Saaremaa,' Martinson said.
A British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to enable him to reach his house and his car with a wrist.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in him so that he could open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a flick of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip inserted between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers the service through his company, BioTeq, to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with consultant anaesthesiologist Dr. Geoff Watson of the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also swaps locks on houses and cars to match the chip, charging £300 per lock.
This married father of one has now installed the technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit went on to cost taxpayers thousands.
According to military documents leaked to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the southern courtyard last month to celebrate American manufacturing cost taxpayers a whopping $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the president's visit, was the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House to promote America's building program.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials were on a tour of manufacturing facilities in all 50 states.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was displayed along with a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Military Cabinet requested the presence of the helicopter with a FARGO, approximately 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south pole yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event", the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy chief aviation officer, the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the south courtyard on July 17th at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the event beginning at 3:15 p.m. and would remain there until the courtyard was cleared between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. that same evening.
Added to that was the fact that if the White House departure were to be delayed, the return flight would require a different crew due to work-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter at the time of the incident and the squadron security team remained near the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
It was impossible to determine from the documents provided to TIME whether a second crew was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event might violate that provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hatch Act, and we were told it did not", the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice", replied the deputy chief executive officer.
The White House declared the Made in America event an official event, and the Hatch Act wouldn't cover it.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President supported the efforts to reform health care, which were then under discussion in the Senate, and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them to travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for a photo shoot is unusual.
Trump came under fire in February when he was behind the presidential plane at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was filled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the Made in America exhibit, which showcases products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers", said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often test flights around Washington and in the South Lawn to practice dropping the President of the United States at the White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 test flights in the White House compound.
According to the official, the flight to the "Made in America" event was counted as part of the normal training flight for the flight crew that month.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "support missions not related to the president".
According to the White House, no other exhibit from this event has ever been taxpayer-priced.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organization of the display of the helicopter in the southern courtyard.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents for the presidential flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's FY17 hourly rates, the VH-3D is compensated at $24,380 per flight hour.
Squadron records indicate a flight time of 30 minutes from this base at Naval Air Station Quantico, Virginia, in either direction.
The White House says the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
'Calculating the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is highly misleading,' said Walters.
'These estimated reimbursement rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.'
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, although they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract related costs.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week's made in America stuff", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the contribution they make to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So it's natural to highlight that".
It's unclear if Trump touched the helicopter as it was making a detour in the southern courtyard of the event, but he did get behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of media reports about the company's products in his personal fleet of aircraft.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I have three of their products".
Grit Shadeiko - Peace and Joy Came Through His Tears
At the 2011 World Cup, Daegus caught Šadeikot in the last zone, ran 800 m on foot and was carried off the stadium with a stretcher.
Just before that, he had been zero in a long jump at a Chinese university.
He was injured in the 2012 Helsinki Olympics, but finished 23rd in his debut Olympics in London with 6013 points.
The misfortune continued, however.
After the opening day of the 2013 World Cup in Moscow, the Estonian long-distance runner who was on the record schedule in Estonia suffered a wrist injury.
Two years later, he finished 15th in the Beijing World Cup and met Olympic standards, but that was a disappointment for the more ambitious athlete.
The hardest blow came to Šadeiko when he failed to score in the first leg of the Amsterdam European Long Jump.
I just want to put together a decent multi-race once in a while.
"Once", pointed out Shadeiko.
Worse still came: a month later, her Olympic competition in Rio was canceled in the first hurdles because of a reindeer injury.
Time to cut back - should we go on with the seven-race series?
Is two days of effort worth it?
The girl thought for a long time, but she found peace.
Helped clear my head
It's kind of hard to describe this experience, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, I had time to heal and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pills in the bag", says Shadeiko, referring to her self-purification.
I got to turn over a new leaf and move on to a new level.
According to Anne Mägi, coach, it was very difficult to see the suffering of the caregiver, but she understood that the athlete himself must first find out.
He was so disrespected by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said that she would not give up and that she wanted to prove herself", says Mägi.
Now he has a kind of peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
Competition returned in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzi multi-event competition.
In high-level competition, he improved his personal best in the shot put by almost a metre (13.89) and ran a near-record time in the hurdles.
Then the multitasker felt that it was not the limit of his abilities, but that the primal hunger for competition had been quenched.
The Mountain, who has been her mentor for years, says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a good athlete, he's good to train.
If there's a problem or something's wrong, he'll tell you right away.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
We'll have to start there.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not a max-trainer", he says, adding that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because that also ensures a good result.

The happiness of loved ones has also brought good emotions to Shadeiko.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and her sister Grete recently became parents, and the multiple-competitor has received support from a new citizen of the air.
"It's been interesting", says Šadeiko.
One drink that is equivalent to "training" the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a fan of wine that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale.
His words are not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts but about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, swallowing the wine, savoring it, and sensing the aftertaste, we are engaging our brain to create the taste of the wine.
Shepherd says that the taste is not actually in the wine molecules but in the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He uses the brain's perception of color as a comparison.
"Taste is not in the wine, taste is in the wine-taster", says Shepherd.
Other factors that affect the taste of wine include our age, our gender, and even the amount of saliva that we produce.
Of course, Shepherd is warning you that wine is not for getting drunk.
"There must be more to the action", he says.
If you take too much of the juice, the system will overload.
Drinking too much wine can harm the brain rather than help it - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance, and impaired mental ability.
10% of Estonian ICT workers receive less pay than their colleagues
Data from the recruitment company Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues.
The 10 percent pay gap between men and women, writes the portal Genie.
The ICT sector salary survey of Fontès involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
In total, 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of the posts were held by men.
"While only three companies said that pay differential was in men's favour and the rest of the companies said that there was no pay differential, in reality, when comparing similar jobs, men's monthly base salary is on average 10% higher than women's and men's total annual salary is on average 8% higher than women's", said Ilmar Pohjala, an analyst at Fontes.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Netflix hit series is taking center stage with Cali Cartel.
Despite the fact that the second season of Narcissus revealed the killer of Pablo Escobar, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has confirmed the third and fourth seasons, and the first of them has already been given a promotional clip that will introduce new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate four powerful crusades as "a Fortune 500 company", just with more bribes to the government and more acts of violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its mastermind, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the Mexican links, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in charge of the New York operation.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement for the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1st.
The UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only be representative of the people if all members of society, including women, play their part in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The importance of the role of women cannot be overstated", she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have threatened an election process that would coincide with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women will increase the progress of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything great, big and small.
There's always too little time for each other, but training with the fans is a great way to combine meeting, playing, intimacy and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you go in the summer, you will always have the live buffalo with you, impatiently reminding you with their tiny voice, "Let's go exercise!"
Start with a warm-up - a casual game of tag or a fly-by-wire along the beach is very good.
The shell is the foundation for standing in the form of feet and ash - who would want to take the form of a sand dune bathed in waves during the summer?
It's a miracle to use children instead of a cane!
First of all, it's safe and comfortable, the weight is gradually increasing at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
The adults can also make out with really big kids.
The child trains his balance, counts repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to be high-minded and important.
Older children can do the same with their own crutches.
The range of motion is established by touching the ground and raising the arms.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the minivan to hold tight.
The kid can read the reps and feel like a coach.
Plank is an expensive, but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make it fun!
Playing board: take a long pile of boards and take turns punching through them.
It's a little harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun to do when you can shake hands with a friend.
To add weight, you can stand on a small stool and walk around in this position.
For simplicity, a taller child may be made to sit on his hips, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While the crabs sizzle on the sand, the triceps, the spleen and the abdominal muscles are subjected to a strain like that of a weasel.
The child will lie down on his feet so that his body weight is evenly distributed in front and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
A stallion can fly, have fun, balance, and be a burden.
Life is a little extra fun for a little trainer when he gets a little kiss every time he crosses.
The extra effort is the stretching of the legs.
Make sure the back is in a neutral position.
Kids have a lot more fun doing abdominals with pairs and a plate.
Hand work and a pulse kick.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
Every kid's favorite and a lot of fun!
Parenting is a really effective whole-body workout.

From the Philippines to the Wide World, or the Whale's Journey to the Heart of Fashion
The shoulder-woven bag is a summer classic, which has become a hit in recent years, hanging on the back of the hand at the right time of the summer, and for which the merchants have managed to forge a price tag worthy of the hit, despite its humble origins.
A shoulder bag is probably one of those things that everyone has had at least once in their life and that has not caused any special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, then nothing's broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real splash, and fashion enthusiasts have swapped their sleek designer bags for simple, shoulder- woven bags for the summer months.
It is not just a beach jacket, but today it is also popular as a street jacket, and bold women even walk into the office with it.
But first, we need to decide whether we should have a summer look at work or a notebook and laptop for a more formal occasion.
But the wealth of variety has made shoulder boots a veritable summer delight for women.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you notice is that fashionistas go on vacation to the local market and buy a backpack that they will wear for the whole holiday, and that they will wear on the beach, at the market, and when hanging out with their girlfriends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger number of bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to each other to become the lucky owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, for it is rare in the fashion world to be able to buy something that has become a hit for just a few dozen dollars.
Yes, the smartest merchants have found a simple way to make money here, and the finest luxury brands sell beer bags for hundreds and thousands of euros.
I guess it's so the wealthier customers don't feel like a bunch of bums walking around with cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag that costs over a thousand euros.
But the interpretation of Chanel's shoulder bag could be in the region of 6,000 euros.
Unlike most of the Mohi, however, the shoulder bags are not the product of any of the great mohicans, but of something far more ancient.
In fact, the shoulder bag is said to have originated in the Philippines, a far-flung place.
The bags are mainly exported and the locals don't often see them around.
The technique of making the basket is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to the usual basket-making.
Since the ruffle bag does not have to be as tight as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into it, making the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, colorful bags or leather straps are becoming increasingly fashionable.
But the most shoulder-bendered of all letters is the one to actress Jane Birkin, who is the biggest knitted shoulder-bender ever seen.
In fact, he could fit a straw bag into any outfit he could find, and he didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
The popularity of bags today is not to be underestimated, however, by the fact that they are easy to care for and, unlike other bags of any kind, do not require special tools, but are easily washed away by water and a wet towel.
As with all trendsetters, after the classic look, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, you may want to buy a shoulder-length ribbon or a small shoulder bag.
But it's worth remembering that the classic feather jacket never goes out of style, but the beer collar does.
But what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, the classic was the shoulder-length bag, which was styled like a basket, open at the top, and with short, also shoulder-length, sleeves.

A man missing for three days on the island has been found
The treasure left his home in the Kärla Valley on Wednesday evening, heading in an unknown direction.
The last contact with the victim was on the phone last night, Friday night, and the positioning of the phone gave the location of the man in the outskirts of Lääne-Saare, the village of Mönnös, where he was searched by helicopter until midnight and by dogs until the early morning.
Then his phone battery died, and his location could not be determined.
The police resumed their search this morning.
The police would like to thank everyone who helped find the treasure.
GMB is concerned about investment in the company's Glasgow plant.
The union is awaiting confirmation from the management of the biscuit maker McVitie's of long-term production plans for the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the investment in the Tollcross facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said they've invested more than £5 million in the property over the last couple of years.
The workers were hired, and union leaders were "the first to know" if there were any changes in factory operations.
In a letter to the manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to 'express its concerns that the funds were not being used to modernise production lines'.
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the CEO of the facility about Tollcross's business and future investment plans is a matter of deep concern to our members.
The multi-generational families that have worked here and the workforce largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow area are essential to support decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So Glasgow East is in dire need of a productivity firm in McVitie's, with jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising housing costs and chronic decline in manufacturing.'
A representative for the Pladis said: 'The manager of the tollcross site received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company is replying directly to him as we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place at Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on a regular basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'In recent years we have invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which has gone into the production lines and improving operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility and should any changes occur in the facility's operations, the employees and union representatives will be the first to hear about it.'
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago against approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain are relentless in their efforts to lure Neymar into their ranks, making a £189 million bid to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking conquest?
This clumsy approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club is poised to break more than twice the current world record for buy-ins, set last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 million.
When the transfer is completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, earning over £500,000 a week after taxes from PSG.
Barcelona are angry about the approach and the way Neymar has been released, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world of such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any clubs considering signing some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will respond and contact those players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with any of our players, they will face the consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could be hit with a blow from this interest, losing one of their most valuable assets in the form of Neymar.
PM: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit threatens to seriously drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland", Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it", he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
'This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,' he stressed.
The Commission has also been asked to take a number of measures to ensure that the EU is able to meet the needs of the citizens of the EU.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second option to smooth Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Surely we could have one with Britain".
The alternative is to return to the customs posts, which would be a sign of historical division and political failure.
"To trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main Northern Irish parties on a visit to Belfast.
Mark Ava, who won his first half-length triathlon, says that anyone can do the Ironman.
Today, the winter capital of Otepää hosted the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics, when about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries attended the half-mile Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among them, Märt Avandi won her first triathlon.
"I thought it would be difficult, and it was", Avandi admitted in the end.
Despite the complexity, Avon admitted that the triathlon is, in fact, a sport that can be done by almost anyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace that kills", he said, suggesting that a fast pace would get everyone to the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Ott's all right physically, but he can't swim".
Avang had been training hard since February.
Four or five hours a week at first, then ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12 he reached the 270th place in the overall standings.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lige (time 05:06:37), he won the other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was "a good role model", lost to Avandi by seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan by 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), and Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm by about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the men's race of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series was crowned by the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27 and the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
The women's race was won by Helle Frederiksen of Denmark in a time of 04:24:01, and by Maria Jänese of Estonia, who lost to Frederikseni by almost half an hour and finished with a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi completed the 1.9 km swim in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in at position 410.
