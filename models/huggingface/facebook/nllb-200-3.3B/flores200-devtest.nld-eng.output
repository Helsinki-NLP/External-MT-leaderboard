Not only does this prove the widely held theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's coat was a brownish-brown with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but have other features of feathers - such as weather hooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were used not for flight but to regulate temperature or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen shows adult feathers rather than the dons of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the extended body of an adult and not the dorsal fin of a chick.

The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to the force exerted by the moon on the earth, which leads to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the constellation Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is enclosed in a circle, and it consists of a large number of smaller particles.

In France, voting has traditionally required little technology: voters go into a voting booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slips the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot paper.
The process is relatively narrowly defined in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process, and volunteers count the votes at night under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, at James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of killing her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness account may be biased because her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have ruled that the publication of photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photographs of suspects, among others.'
The Crown Office has overall charge of prosecutions and has informed journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been laid.
Sources say the document refers to a settlement of the dispute, something the Palestinians wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to be there for five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the test was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
Martelly has won five CEP awards in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to hold new elections in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious".
"Very regrettable", the ministry's response was to Apple's delay in the report.
Mariana was struck by the earthquake at 0719 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency has stated that there are no reports of damage nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former police officer from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and entered the medical profession.
Trained as a midwife, he began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins did research on premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, and Luna died on the night of two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that Luna was "just as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of the respondents to this poll supported this view, that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially since the earth has long since collided with comets.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and chatter".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, according to the FAA, saving millions of tons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technologies, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no extra transport and no overhead trains stop at Wembley; in addition, there is no access to the car parks and P&R on the site.
A possible lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without fans.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science looked at the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take much longer because it took longer to cross a native Darwin's finch, the Middle ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus finch, the Española finch.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be drawn in a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
After it is made very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the carbon juice then changes according to the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and make a ball.
The fluid on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, nearly every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
There are sewage remnants found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were toilets in China, Egypt, and Persia in ancient times, and in the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen met in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Once the space satellite receives the call, it'll beam it back immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To guide a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is over 100 feet [30 m] long.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transportation are the result of this.
There are medium-sized cats among the medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, many small cats (such as free-roaming domestic cats) prey on larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has that doesn't allow them to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called troops.
Herds consist of one to three adult males who are related to one another and also have up to 30 females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves much as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines), and which are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and has five times the traction power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full force like a lion. It is more like a sentence of a whole roar.
The ocelot's favorite food is small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and it hunts almost exclusively on animals much smaller than itself.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt down small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They have night vision, so they can see very well in the dark, and they move very inconspicuously.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks off from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, resources and enemies are different, so the new population must change its attitude or adapt to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can't call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it simply involves the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, plants obtain their nutrients from the sun and provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made from plants, and we eat plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at the time, and had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing or no one could escape him.
We're not sure, but it's possible that its tongue was forked, and it ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even its own kind.
Nothing in the water was safe from the attacks, nor were giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including porcupines, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
There was another difference, too: Poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain foods that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was considered to be the home of that god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers were built in the shape of pyramids, called ziggourats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were of little importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was largely outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were little more than a street-side counter; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so timber was very expensive.
According to Norse mythology, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it his name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
Although all of them were 'Scandinavian' countries, the personalities, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
You might think after the movie National Treasure that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure chest.
The words "Original American Declaration of Independence, D. July 4, 1776" appear on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the text being upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is certain who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) was formerly rolled up for storage.
It therefore appears that the indication was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which was French people who had joined the Germans in 1940 and were therefore aligned with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon, an invasion of southern France.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks, and then they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which in turn means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations, and a civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave behind no relevant historical evidence, and thus are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, having no national executive or judicial power, and relied on state authorities for the execution of all decisions, which often were uncooperative.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate rates.
First, all states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands over which Japan has jurisdiction, Japan is often referred to geographically as a "peninsula".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC settled in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC adopted the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Built from three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Ramen.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like before.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work is still going on.
For example, the most common still image image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the common film format in the later analogue era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, at a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would then be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equivalent to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and which many find ridiculous, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, so you divide the image vertically and horizontally into threes (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the commoner, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has resources for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the church was the central authority in Rome, and this relationship of power and money caused many people to question whether this principle was being followed.
Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany immediately after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to military and civilian needs, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law, which was codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters, rendering entire sections of the ocean impassable, even to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unbridled undersea warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the different dynasties, with the provinces divided, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which occurred in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, fierce wars were fought between various nobles who were vying for the throne.
In ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in recorded history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for supremacy in the great palace of Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the view that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than to a single leader.
All male applicants were eligible for posts after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same thing is true in the military, where rank is no longer based on one's class, but on one's caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with supernatural matters, and he often went to meditate in a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Nour.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on a mountain top on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find, because once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
All that is visible is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and there is very little of this world to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of the many great pyramid structures that were built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a notch or a square with a missing bottom.
Top means you start at the tip and push the string away, bottom means you start at the frog's point (the place where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, whereas a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of sketching your personal characters, but remember that the printed dashes are there for a musical reason, so they usually need to be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a group of market women supported the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jubilant and threatening mobs that threatened the King and Queen.
The actions of the mob forced the Queen and the King to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a frightened queen.
The cost of the war of U.S. imperialism in the Philippines has been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested in large part on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, which were again followed by the Late Middle Ages, usually ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide assortment of ideas in practice: from the technology supply or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: that the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the coming of the automobile automatically leads to the building of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The massive car ownership is also causing more road accidents and this is leading to the development of new health care techniques to repair the human body.
Romanticism incorporated a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time, habits and cultures arose around this geography, forming a harmonious society that was superior to arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the fashion capital of today.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the West lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, a style of dress began to develop in Western Europe, and one of the most important developments was the result of the Crusades, when people began to use knots to secure their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that stores seeds from the ecoregion and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture may be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often indicate their group membership by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave, and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who, through neglect, setbacks or wilful abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some wolf cubs have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents would not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unavailable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child not raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to the behavior of the animal that cared for the child (within the physical limits), such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning should make education simpler and more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, for example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paper clipper.
There's virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not properly cared for, where they are not cared for, and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
The idea is that foster care provides a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
The Internet is merging elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are presented as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'persistent relationships' when they examined responses from the public on websites.
Using video recordings has led to remarkable discoveries in interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can detect a lie by looking at micro-expressions alone.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, described how it is that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately gauge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, the two groups vary through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of man can survive on the savannah but has difficulty obtaining the amino acids it needs from the plant sources found there.
Furthermore, failure to observe it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and even death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ant, termite, egg) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption involves waking up for a reason during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy to do by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without you waking up all at once.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put this on the other side of the room, and this way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of fluids before going to bed (and then especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which makes you have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calm a person has is measured by the amount of stress a person is enduring in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present.
Anyone can lighten his or her mind, and only your own stress and negativity will get in the way of that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a pursuit of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is aroused.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus, using the visualization of various deities to cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and bring consciousness into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a cooperation was established between the USSR and the USA. When the war was over, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and proxy wars were fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until 17 September 1939, when they were forced to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
These plans were overturned overnight, however, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Carrying goods by ship is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is hindered.
The U.S. was trying to get men and equipment across the Atlantic to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of World War II, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen to Germany had the Allies failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily obtain hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture, and were then guarded by goat herders, as the more familiar sheep herder was often a child or younger.
As early as the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were built in England.
Although horse tracks consisted of only a railing of planks, the horses had to run faster and to pull larger quantities than on the somewhat impassable roads of the time.
Early on, crossbars were used to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if an iron tip was present on the top.
This soon became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the carriage's wooden wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were laid.
The first known form of transportation is walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus, which means upright man, appeared.
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
And we find two-legged specialisations in the fossil record of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and the Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate some future suffering.
In many cases it is something like a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological advances of human society have obviously changed the earth dramatically, and overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have added to the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away, signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and these are now better known as the Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, while another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Fragments are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the original handwritten copy having not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species alive today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their feet, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary numbers is the basis for almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open-box medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific E.R.P. instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is formally called "bugs" by entomologists.
The term is derived from an age-old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both red predator and bed bugs are nest-bound, having adapted to live in the nest or the home of their host.
In the U.S., there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in adults of both young and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the main goal of science, and this method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experimentation; a trial is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to place question marks and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
Physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms often have a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live by periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a period of time, even when no external signals are being emitted.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important clues that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out: in one experiment, the DNA in the phage was marked with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein in the phage was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary, and other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
The sites include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, parks, and the study of the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that because of this huge carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are comparatively rare.
Why do so many complaints arise about transport systems, why do things go wrong every day, are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably, which means that traffic flows show some consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
The three core characteristics are linked to better reflect traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape predators and more efficiently find food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places from predators.
At present, only dragonflies and gulls can't fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, and so the sun (and other stars) revolved around it.
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, measuring in some places six miles wide.
Some 20 percent of all the water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and its water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language of official communication and law in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
Humans have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since antiquity, because they are all found in nature and are fairly easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Well, alloys are simply a combination of at least some metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are included in the metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are a trillion atoms that fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has been degraded as newer writing methods have become available and is used much less.
Today, you can write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a dot-cutter.
You can wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atom bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, meaning that they break apart at the slightest or smallest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marshes on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could more easily come to the surface there.
Content theories are about finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that certain people have needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's motivational hygiene theory.
In general, two approaches emerge when managers take charge of their former colleagues: one approach is to try to position themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary action, to conduct evaluation meetings, to delegate and to call people to their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, he or she transforms into an unrecognizable individual, who feels compelled to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to take it all for himself.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports, and the invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity are manifested when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must foster a culture that places innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning at the heart.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, allowing the scope of research to be narrowed and more precise data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
With the advent of new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes of the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us a better understanding of the processes of our minds.
AI is what most people think of as science fiction, but it's also an essential part of computer science, and it's used in research on machine behavior, machine learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is one area of AI research.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this system of artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technological developments have made virtual excursions possible, allowing students to view artifacts in a museum, peer inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better, often with poor grammar and spelling at the beginning, but quickly changing as they have an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'.The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help learners develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussion on the Internet, learners can find their own place in the context of other people's material, while at the same time forming their own views on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south, Niagara Falls, and further north, the beautiful, pristine Muskoka and beyond.
This is the kind of thing that makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are fairly sparsely populated, and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than in all of Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them the Islamic faith, which then spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the north by the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not this is true.
It also helps to make rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should bear in mind that cultural differences can lead to behaviour which they consider intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to be manly (cultural differences don't speak for you!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but after an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad, and the Spanish merchants who established their trading base here called it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the eruption of Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, check the state of affairs regarding the fighting that is going on in the province of North Kivu.
It is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and is home to some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively inaccessible and is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a run-down city, though its reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport makes it a popular destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS show Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is different from the other cities in the country because it has an Arab feel to it than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, the border with Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 7,500 square miles (19,500 square kilometers), divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wildlife species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entry fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of South African parks or to all of the national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, and many tourists consider it to be the most important place.
The sheer number of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart that is made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbor.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The vast majority of the population of Hong Kong Island live in close proximity to each other on the land they have acquired along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Indian and Bengali interior.
The Sundarbans are now officially a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part within India's borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps  they also boast some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, one-third of which is peatland and swampland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axis herons.
During the day, buses leave from the station on the border of the districts (across the river), most of them between 6.30 and 7.30, mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since the regional buses are often full.
In most neighborhoods, small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses are available.
Shared taxis provide quick and comfortable travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the building is 378 meters long and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, and Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group, living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly called 'the great province of India,' came into existence in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous people.
A three-century period of colonization by the Spanish followed.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is approximately equal to one British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, where you can change money.
In general, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley is also often a place where credit cards and U.S. dollars are accepted.
In the remote islands, you may not be able to pay by credit card, but you may be able to pay in British and American currency.
Please change your money before you leave the islands, as Falklands currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with temperatures above 30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures that rarely drop below freezing, but the wind combined with humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year, with no recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are wild after all, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bear, and just about any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they may appear.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking scented food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of nearly 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port, a situation that came to be known as the infamous deadlock.
All ships were sunk except one British battleship, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed in a violent meeting in the city that got out of hand.
There are many beaches, particularly because of Auckland's two harbors, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district stretch north to south along the Great Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
At Waitemata's Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good supply of shops on the coast.
Number One is the main local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for travel.
The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians, black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian quality, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're great.
Excursions to the reef take place all year round and injuries resulting from these excursions to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cuboid whales occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770 and occasionally outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they don't normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes even flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a while or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you should do so through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to be early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember this: Even when the music on the main stage has stopped, other parts of the festival area may still be playing music late into the night.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Watch where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic in winter, because the ice-cold journey makes a lot of noise if you're too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Casinos generally strive to make the most of the time and money spent by guests, and windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They normally have special offers in the areas of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in good spirits and to prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is vitally important to stay sober.
When you go up in the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should be aware that there may be snow or ice and that the temperature may be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and it drives differently from asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall to cause a snowball to become stuck in a very short period of time.
Also, visibility may be impaired by falling or floating snow or by the presence of condensation or ice on the vehicle's windshields.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many lands and do not hinder traffic.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safari, which for many visitors is the highlight of their trip.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to trips over land to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars, otherwise you're not likely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'running safari') involves walking for several hours or days in succession.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to host the Olympics twice, the first time in 1964.
If you've already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a predicament.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these things even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not want to wear socks with irons, you can also use a hair dryer if one is available.
Avoid overheating the fabric (this may cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, to become hot).
There are a number of ways to purify water, some of which are effective in preventing specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective, so if you have doubts, it is best to drink from a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not present in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill humans, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save considerable money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, and you often drive through abandoned backcountry terrain, which makes this one challenging.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your head down, you'll come across many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp bends.
The posted maximum speeds are noticeably lower than in previous and successive areas  usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important to stick to them than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have a much greater range here than in other corners of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are delicious and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, as are the pastries of its southern neighbour, Austria.
You will see many fruit cakes. All year round the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some that are called in the Berliner region Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
To make a curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most common Javanese seasonings are nuts, peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic herbs.
Stiletto harnesses support the rider's feet and hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but may also pose safety problems because a rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear firstly riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety harnesses that allow a saddle's stirrup to be released when the saddle is pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginnings of the sport of skiing date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Noren.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is often done on steep terrain, and you need a lot of sturdier skis and boots.
You can think of the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than walking, but it is rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country running on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and travellers between different countries normally have to apply for a visa and undergo passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions in this area almost as one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique, and some tax offices give the definition of antique to goods over 100 years old.
The definition may vary by location, for example in North America the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label artisanal products as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood, and the culture of trade is very important for many other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they subsisted on fishing, hunting and other activities, mostly using reindeer as a pack animal.
Many Sámi today work in modern trades.In Sápmi, the Sámi area tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, but is also often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If the country you are going to has a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance.
You can also consult the advice of other authorities, but their advice is directed to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions only give a brief summary of the political situation in a particular country.
They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared with other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather events, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The effects of severe weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather in their area, as these can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search for "hostile environment courses" on the Internet will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course normally covers all the issues discussed in this document in greater detail, usually in conjunction with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, lots of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
There is a wide variation in the way governments want to issue passports that do not mention gender (X), or in the way they want to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
In addition, security check searches have become much more extensive since 9/11.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery can expect that they will not go through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reef currents are the returning stream of waves that break on a reef or similar and flow onto the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a fast flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
When you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is so much fun.
Try to get to a place where you can't get caught again, and depending on your skill level and whether you've been spotted, you can wait for help.
The return shock is worse than the culture shock (you have a less 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures may have difficulty adjusting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your own culture.
In the past, when you went to a foreign country, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected of travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the neighborhood.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all silence before the show starts.
Often, the sounds of vendors and tourists are heard here, and the story of light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
The panels appear as projections on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have been claimed by several countries since then, and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception, which is the full-fledged crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, bordering Bellingshaus Lake.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula cross into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer Mount Ellsworth range, which is crossed by the Minnesota River.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson, at 12,528 feet (4,892 m), the highest mountain.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local telephone provider can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
It's becoming more popular for people who plan to spend a gap year traveling and learning.
The main beneficiaries of this are school leavers who take a gap year before university without any adverse effects on their studies.
Often, enrolling in a foreign course during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
The normal fee for enrollment in these educational programmes is a tuition fee.
Finland is a fantastic sailing destination, and the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in its lakes and in its offshore archipelagos.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelago or the lakes.
The archipelago of islands and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any hunt, but smaller boats or even a kayak give you a different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their leisure time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is similar to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, and is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This will allow you to spend a few full days in the historic site and overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be intimidating for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different from many fears other people have.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to remove a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies are generously compensated for delivering items quickly, while time is often of the essence when business documents, merchandise, or spare parts are needed for a necessary repair.
Larger companies could use their own planes for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
When they send things by air, it can take days on some routes before they're unloaded and through customs.
The only way to make it go faster was to check it in as checked baggage, which is what the airline regulations require, which is that you have to be a passenger in the baggage claim.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to deposit a bag of money for this privilege (or better yet, have your employer do it for you).
But this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times for economy class and about 11 times for first class.
It usually doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere fast and comfortable, and the airlines therefore charge appropriate fees.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, where the Romanian language is the most widely spoken, but Russian is also common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was beset by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by UN members.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but still the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a remarkable octagonal church.
On a number of the graves near the church are fascinating marble carvings of pigeons.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely take a look around this village.
To the north is the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of its magnificent monuments.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover in Cabo da Roca.
Also head north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally famous Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has almost incalculable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
Many of the men and women who survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or who have worked themselves to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity, do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by marking or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Yet, most of the signs are in Catalan, since that is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is widely spoken in public transportation and other services.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned stops are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
Parisians are known to be selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just a false stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well brought up). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their ways.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying altitude differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the heron are found here, along with all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt up to the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, a woman gets a cloth when she arrives at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own copy, with its bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will laugh at you.
On the other hand, men should wear pants to the knee-deep.
You can borrow them from the supply at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable with them.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, the Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to connoisseurs, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, like "sie" which means "you", always have a capital letter at the beginning, even though they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way you make a distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation is generally not a problem.
You should pay the most attention to the c and the g. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows.
Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Thus, reading this introduction to grammar will already teach you much about the grammar of Persian and help you to understand sentences.
It's quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar to this that you don't need to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't as big a problem then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossoms and it's been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you must resist the urge to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and virtually everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the "high tropics", but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the surviving burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take actually goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting towns along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also show popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
In addition, nonbelievers in Christian lands and non-Christians throughout the world have adopted many of the traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all night for Easter until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
In traditional churches, a Passover vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
The long distance from the mainland made it impossible for mammals to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard workwear, and coworkers call each other by surname or job title.
Consensus in the workplace is crucial, focusing on group performance rather than individual work performance.
Employees often need to get permission from their supervisors before they can make a decision and are expected to follow the instructions of the supervisors without thinking.
