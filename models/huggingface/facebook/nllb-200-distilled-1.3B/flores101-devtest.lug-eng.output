The researchers suggest that the animal's plumage was chestnut-white on the outer and flat or carotenoid-colored underside.

Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: self-loathing, neglect, and even premature death.
The most readily available plant products would be the nutrients found in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for us humans to eat if left uncooked.
In comparison, animal food (e.g. beef, mosquitoes, eggs) has been shown to be highly digestible, have a high nutritional content and contain all the necessary acids.
In addition, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their nutrient problem in the same way as the grasshoppers of today.
