A 9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere .
Police have been on a search for a 9-year-old boy who escaped from a house in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing persons report has gone viral on social media after he left West Tampere with his friend.
The police have confirmed that the boy has been contacted and that he is not in danger of life or health.
The boy's father told Night-Words at midnight that he had found his son.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the after-school discussion.
The boy was found in the area near the house, his father said.
Ronaldo in a rage again - ripped the goal away from Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his exploits in the Champions League.
The battle for the Champions League title between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo turned, at least for a moment, in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo single-handedly moved to the top of the all-time scoring list when he shot two penalties and one game-time goal into the net of visiting Shahtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo has now raised his goal to 80 against the Barcelona side who were level with him before Tuesday, with a total of 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been struggling in Serie A this season, but they have started strongly in the Champions League with a 2-1 home win over Manchester City.
The winning goal came with ten minutes to go for Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the City was thwarted by the absence of Sergei Aguero, a knee-injurer.
Injured in the weekend's league game, Aguero only came on in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United's other club also suffered a tough loss in the Netherlands, losing 1-2 to PSV Eindhoven.
The fight between the two teams, led by 20-year-old defenceman Luke Shaw, lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slip-call hit the goal against the attacking ManU pack so hard that Shaw likely broke a leg bone.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before paramedics left to take him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors in the 41st minute to take a 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno was leveling before half-time in extra time.
PSV scored the winning goal in the second half from Luciano Narsingh.
The season in the Champions League began with the A-Block Paris Saint-Germain.
The case involved Argentine Angel Di Maria, who had changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through on the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 to PSG in the second half.
PSG is among the favourites for the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is one of the league's smaller clubs, is not the best possible reference point.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his first professional appearance against his old club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team Moscow TsSKA lost in the B-Block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president made a false statement
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he made a month ago.
President Robert Mugabe has made a speech to the Zimbabwean parliament, the same speech he made at the end of last month.
In the 25 minutes of his speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize it was the same speech.
The speech raised doubts about whether 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirits.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded that Mugabe step down, saying he was too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion was only in Mugabe's cabinet and that the president had done nothing wrong.
President Mugabe's speech was about the past and present impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want extra summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week because of the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who heads the summits, assessed the request.
The EU's position on the issue of asylum is that it is a matter of principle that the EU should be able to provide asylum seekers with the necessary information.
The EU is also considering the possibility of a new round of negotiations with the United States on the issue of asylum.
Professor admits to shooting his girlfriend on a 911 call.
University professor Shannon Lamb called 911 to report a slightly trembling voice to the police in his home, saying he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there, alive and probably scared, and the professor said that the dead woman's family had the contact information on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on a white paper that read: "I am very sorry and wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amya, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", according to the letter signed by Lamb.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 miles to the school's campus, where police found the presumed dead body of Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, outside his office door, whom Lamb is believed to have shot.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university authorities received a report of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He says Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after this.
There was one more death to go today, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught up with him.
The shooting occurred the next day, and students and faculty remained tightly locked behind locked doors, as authorities continued to try to determine Lamb's motives.
The researchers were able to get a detailed picture of both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb gave him a description of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students always said that they looked forward to the professor's lessons.
According to Gautier police in the county where Prentiss died, the professor had no history of violence or criminal activity.
Schmidt, in turn, had mentioned Lamb in his book, in which he had given credit to "the wonderful people" with whom he had spent his academic life.
Both worked in the department of social sciences and history, which had a teaching staff of 17 people, many of whom attended courses taught by both men.
However, signs of trouble did emerge.
Brandon Beavers, a student of Lambia, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like he was in trouble".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously taken a leave of absence from Delta State University due to some sort of health problem.
This year, she only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policy meant that the thesis for which Lamb had worked so hard would not automatically guarantee him an associate professorship.
William LaForge, the university president, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that something was clearly wrong with Lamb.
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, police traced the route Lamb took from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police caught up with Lamb, he had killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running on the front porch.
Police were not immediately clear as to why Lamb had gone to this particular house, but Johnson said he believed that the man knew the occupants.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started as a geography and education teacher at a university with 3,500 students, and a 2009 population of 12,000.
She got her PhD in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longest-standing friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play the guitar.
"The Lamb was quite the heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were on his back", said Hairston, now 40, who lives in Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no record of them being engaged.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house on the river bank in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, told the press that he and Prentiss had been separated for 15 years, that the couple had remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19.
"He was completely shocked", O'Steen said of his daughter.
"My daughter and my mother were best friends.
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they would play together on occasion.
O'Steen says his daughter writes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gauthier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5 after Lamb played guitar and harmonica to a small audience.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"Happy couple", said Shaffer.
"We were joking together.
We both had a good sense of humor".
"Professor Schmidt, who was killed, was the director of the first year's seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history", said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and sorority.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for a candlelit memorial service, including faculty, staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the evening's event, where the university choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The class will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get students back", LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day".
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assisting reporters are Emily Wagster Pettus of the Associated Press in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana of the New Orleans.
The police are now saying that Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and they're also saying that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss' wife in the 911 call, there's no evidence of a marriage between the two.
Toys R Us is going to hire fewer seasonal workers.
Toys R Us is not planning to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will offer its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work overtime.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and in 2014 it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month and new recruitment will begin in October/December.
Although there are still months before the holiday season, the commercial season is approaching in full force, and businesses are preparing by hiring temporary workers to work in stores and to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The opening night of Back to the Future was a defining moment in Michael J. Fox's career.
First night had a personal meaning, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty seat next to me, and I realized that Princess Diana was coming next to me", Fox said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
"As the movie began, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales".
The Back in Time documentary is a tie-in to the Back to the Future films, and features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie Back to the Future was released 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely, for me, the greatest time travel movie of all time", Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released on VOD and DVD, and will be shown in select theaters beginning in October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution to the Syrian crisis
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military action, saying there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons will only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General reiterated his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
The European Union calls on the EU to continue to support the efforts of the United States to establish a peaceful, stable and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, and to support the efforts of the United States to establish a peaceful and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.
The European Union is also committed to the peace process in the Middle East, and the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has called for a political solution to the conflict.
The EU's Foreign Ministers will meet in Brussels on the same day as the European Council.
Chapter 8 of the polls: Is Donald Trump for real?
There's been an attempt to label Trump a bigot.
He's also been called a joke.
Some people are predicting a Trump meltdown.
Republicans have tried (so far) to pull Trump out of the race by any means necessary.
Eleven of the nation's eleven polls are giving Donald Trump double-digit approval ratings, and some are already pondering what that says about the real estate mogul's chances of running.
But the election is still in its early stages.
There's no announcement yet that Trump will be elected as the Republican nominee.
And experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was running for president, was able to give way to the rising Herman Cain, and neither of them won the nomination in any state.
There are a lot of reasons why Trump would have a hard time in the general election.
Outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth have noticed Trump's strong position and started digging a path to overthrow him.
The following recent Gallup data shows that the real estate market cannot be bypassed by the housing market:
There's been a complete reversal in the Trump campaign.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll found that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the housing mogul.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive attitude.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding figure was 52%.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten have a negative mental image.
These figures also hold true in states where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinnipiac poll, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were very happy or happy with Trump's possible candidacy.
Only two out of ten would be extremely dissatisfied with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent would be very happy with Carson's candidacy and 40 percent with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding approval rating of 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as their party's nominee.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is a problem.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his power-hungry and insulting comments, and 52 percent of Republican supporters nationwide think the real estate mogul's characteristics are appropriate for the president, according to a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same is true in Iowa, where the convention will be the first: according to the Quinnipiac poll, 52 percent of Republicans think Trump's personal qualities are appropriate for commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
But according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent of Americans think Trump is incapable of performing his duties effectively, and six out of 10 think Trump's temperament is inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be the party's nominee, according to a CNN and ORC poll, four out of ten believe Trump has the potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, versus only 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to think that Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans endorse one candidate, Trump will out-vote almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump, as Trump's opponents divide into supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in an imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win the support of the larger crowd.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
Cruz is the only real opponent of Trump?
Ben Carson would take a 19-point victory over Trump in a fictional duel.
A slim majority of Trump supporters say they've already made their decision to vote.
A CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday found that more than half of Trump supporters are confident in their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at this moment, the confident voter can also change his mind.
Forty-six percent of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's current bitter rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the hot topic of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's high-handed speeches will alienate key Latino voters from the Republican ranks and hinder the renewal of the brand.
But according to a poll released Monday by ABC News and the Washington Post, six in 10 Republicans are aligned with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican vote, and the popularity is greatly enhanced by the fact that they both ran as outsiders.
Republican forces are looking for a fresh face to run for office, not a political hotshot, according to the latest ABC News and Washington Post poll, which found that six out of 10 Republicans were in favor of the nomination.
These two candidates are also bitter about Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa poll found that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the Republicans' performance in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are on the verge of outrage".
Jeremy Corbyn made his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
After the election, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
Labour's new front-man Jeremy Corbyn is due to rise for the first time to show his strength at David Cameron's Question Time later.
The first of his six questions will be put to the House shortly after noon, with the media and Labour Party leaders closely following him.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more fact to be added to the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover all types of waste, including waste from the production of electrical and electronic equipment.
The decision by the Labour Party to silence the national anthem during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has been criticised by many Tory MPs and has made the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem was a cause for alarm.
The representative of Corbyn said during Corbyn's sixth national anthem, in silence, the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite his opposition to the monarchy.
The shadow ministers of the ten have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign policy.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, believes that political disagreements over UK membership of the EU and the government's crackdown on the terms of benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told the TUC meeting that Labour would propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the UK, and to extend it to include the whole of the UK.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the past decade as leader of the Tory party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a new approach to politics, says he has chosen the questions to be asked to Cameron out of 30,000 suggestions received from the public.
Corbyn, who represents Islington North, said there was too much conflict in the Q&A session, and he promised to avoid clever words and puns and to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that Shadow Minister Angela Eagle will cover for him in question hours, for example when Cameron is out of the country.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the power to adopt legislative acts, and that the European Parliament should be given the power to adopt legislative acts.
After Corbyn's 2005 leadership, Cameron said he wanted to do away with the puppet politics that is often associated with the polling station, but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his efforts.
Since the first televised poll in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of the leader's judgment, control of the lower house and position, but critics say it has become a caricature that needs major reforms.

The UK's wage growth is strengthening the economy
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 up.
In May and July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year, excluding bonuses.
The faster-than-expected growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1 percent, and its exchange rate was quoted at $1,5505.
The FTSE 100 index was up 1.49% to 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which lost 20% after receiving a preliminary bid from a competitor, AB InBev.
If the deal were to go through, it would bring together the world's two largest breweries and bring under one roof brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9% on the back of the positive results of the luxury-focused rival Richemont Group.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than expected, and sales were also up in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in a stock offering as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The largest drop was seen in Mond, a packaging and paper group, where shares fell by 4.3% as Goldman Sachs lowered the company's share price for the purpose of a sell-off.
JD Sports' share price rose 3.1 per cent after the sports business announced that its pre-tax profit would rise 83 per cent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hurt expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the Board of JD Sports, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
Cowgill said that the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against Aldi's rampage.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's takeover of South and Western Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to preserve the market share of IGA retailers in South and Western Australia against Aldi's $700 million AUD invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media, and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign, with Simmo ice cream factory in Dunsborough offering snacks in IGA stores and retailers selling tickets to regular customers for South Australian Football League games at discounted prices.
Metcash is expected to release more details on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trade Association will hold its annual Investment Strategy Day.
This is a significant market, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores and the coverage of these regions is higher than that of the Eastern States' IGA store network.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their cornered nature and IGA dealers have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, compared to only 14% in the Eastern States.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, eating up sales from all operators, but especially from operators independent of the chain.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could sell 360 million and Metcash could sell 250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in sales in these regions.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume could mean a loss of $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldy and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
The Commission considers that the aid is necessary to restore the long-term viability of the company.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, chief portfolio officer of Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that he believes it is highly likely that Metcash will disappear completely within 10 years.
Metcash has refused to comment publicly on Douglas' comments.
It's understandable that a member of the Metcashi board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the profit margin of the Metcashi food business, which serves 1200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% from the 2012 level.
However, the retailer is taking countermeasures, making an annual contribution of more than A$150 million to match Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products each week.
Ian Morrice, Metcash's CEO, said that the company's price revisions and store restructuring plans are well underway and that it will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy, is defending Thanasi Kokkinakis.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves special mention for his conduct rather than criticism.
According to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy, who has been a casualty in the recent Nick Kyrgios-led Yup'ka, Kokkinakis deserves special mention rather than criticism.
The younger of the two, known as Special K, was put in an unfavorable light when bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after, in a playoff between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate the two rivals twice. "Wawrinka should have given up on Kyrgiosis and that guy of mine", Harrison said.
At the US Open, Kokkinakis, frustrated, hit the pitch as powerful crunches ruined his match.
The teenage superstar is currently in Glasgow, where he will battle Sam Groth for the singles title behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been dragged into the dispute", Healy said.
"He broke the bar when he lost a match at the US Open, and he's certainly not the first player to break the bar because of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of his accomplishment.
But he has done very well in dealing with the provocative behaviour of, say, Harrison at the US Open, and I think he deserves credit.
He's got a strong team, a brilliant family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and complements the team well, he has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players, he trains hard, is in good shape and is a very stable and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on his own merits".
He also supported the decision to remove Kyrgios from the Australian team for the important tour starting on Thursday, describing it as a joint decision that works for all parties, but he favours the return of the Canberra ace as a long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches, rather than the controversy surrounding Kyrgios", Healy added.
Nick has risen to the top very quickly, and as Federer and Murray and others have pointed out, this young man is growing up in the public eye, and he deserves the criticism he's going to get for his terrible mistakes, but we're trying to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions, and we're also trying to give him a little bit of peace, and I think that's the best thing for the team and for Nick".
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained illegal immigrants, in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants piled into no man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted with fury.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain in their tents indefinitely on the crossroads between the checkpoints of the countries
Frustration began to surface.
As a police helicopter flew overhead, they shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them protested, and they started eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Ministry said it would not accept sending migrants back to Hungary at the same time as more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation will have to be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The conflict on the Hungarian-Serbian border began days later, after the Group of 28 failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and expressed the hope that an agreement could be reached by the end of the month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would take in the 120 000 migrants, including those from Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called an extraordinary summit for the following week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes in Brussels or in neighbouring countries for rapid action.
The emergency situation developed on Tuesday to allow the authorities in two remote areas to use more effective means, namely to close roads and speed up legal proceedings in asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Hungary is also planning to build a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that the fence on the Serbian border has already been completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in a bidding contest to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of them refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people arriving are refugees from the conflict, not war refugees, who have the right to seek asylum, a view that sharply differs from that of other EU states, including Germany.
A new law, which took effect at midnight in Hungary, makes it a crime to cross or damage the four-meter-high barbed-wire fence that the government has built along the southern border toward Serbia, and it also sets longer sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by the mass riots, the government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
"We draw a hard line: illegal border crossing is a crime".
In practice, Parliament still has to approve military action, which is expected next week.Associated Press reporters on the border have seen for several days heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Orban's internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that authorities have caught 45 attempts to cross the border at the border itself and 15 at the border further afield.
The people who managed to cross the border by harming Aida are now in police custody, and will be charged with crimes under the new laws.
The authorities are working on the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday, one of which was closed with a railway carriage covered in barbed wire.
Chaos ensued at the main border crossing near Roszken, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container to a point of transit, where people packed inside.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road linking Serbia and Hungary, and people declared themselves in a state of food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's leadership over Bernie Sanders reduced by half, according to a national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's approval rating is still in the double digits in the race for the Democratic national presidential nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has narrowed the gap.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has yet to announce his possible exit from the presidential race, and his approval rating among Democrats is 15 percent.
With more than five months until the primary, for most Democrats, it's too early to tell who they'll support.
But Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support the other candidates.
After the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support from several Democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has gained new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong lead among women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.
Clinton's approval rating among men has dropped significantly, and she has a five-percent lead over Sanders.
Clinton has lost his lead in the under-50s, and now he's on par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has a clear lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading Sanders by double digits in the Liberals' polls, but now Sanders has taken five points off Clinton's neck in this group.
About half of Democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if she were elected as the party's nominee.
A quarter would support Clinton with the least reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he's a candidate.
Six percent of the people in this country would not support Clinton.
It should come as no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters if he were to be elected.
There's more of a split in the outlook among those who don't currently support Clinton, with only about a quarter saying they'd be eager to support her.
The Democratic vote is 48 percent for Clinton, while the Republican vote is only 35 percent for the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When asked to describe freely why they support Clinton's candidacy, the most popular reason is Clinton's experience in the right (16 per cent), the second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a woman president (13 per cent) and the third that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton supporters also cite his connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There's also a reference to the likelihood of winning the election.
The vice president is still considering his candidacy, and 57 percent of Democratic voters would like him to run, while a third would prefer to keep him out of the race.
When asked by Democratic voters for the second most popular candidate for the party's nominee, the majority voted for Biden.
With more than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate behind Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead over Sanders, which is 20 points with Sanders, and it will increase to 30 points if Sanders doesn't run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters believe Clinton is the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that's down from 78 percent last month.
Biden, who is now in second place, is a long way from Clinton, but there are more and more people who believe in Biden's chances of winning the general election.
But Democratic voters are more concerned with their views on issues than with the candidates' chances of winning.
Voters don't find any of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates impossible to accept.
Voters consider the Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be qualified.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and leaders.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often seen as a leader.
The Democratic voters, up to 30 percent, do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 15 percent do not think Sanders is honest and trustworthy.
Democratic voters think the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to their own ideology.
On all the attributes, about a quarter of them don't have an opinion about Sanders.
When asked about Hillary Clinton's use of her private email and her own server as Secretary of State, a majority of Democratic voters said they were satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it hasn't changed their perception of Clinton.
Americans, more broadly, disagree.
Half of the American people are dissatisfied with the Clinton report, and only a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans feel that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall image of Clinton, with 36 percent saying that the image has changed in a negative way.
Of that 36 percent, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her own party voters, there is room for improvement in these qualities when asked for the views of all voters: Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by only 32 percent, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62 percent of all voters do not think Clinton is honest or trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 percent of all voters nationwide also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump get good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates surveyed, Biden, Carson, and Bush were considered the most trustworthy.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, a lot of people don't think Sanders is honest.
The sample is 351 voters, and the margin of error is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the national opinion poll.
In the latest opinion polls by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has overtaken Donald Trump.
These two candidates will take more than half the votes in the new poll, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Trump's approval ratings among Republican voters nationwide have soared from a 23% rise in the CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News debate to a 27% increase in the poll released on Tuesday.
But Carson's approval rating would rise dramatically over the same time period, from 6 percent to 23 percent.
The poll shows Carson's strong support in all demographics, but in the college-educated demographic, he's beating Trump by a wide margin.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are far behind, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's approval rating the weakest, having dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6 percent of the vote.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 percent in one direction or the other.
According to the latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, Carson's approval rating is up 19 percent among Republicans, compared to Trump's 32 percent.
Also, in the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
At a meeting of the men last week, Trump made unfounded accusations against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said Saturday in Iowa during a campaign rally.
Five members of the congregation charged with the murder of a student at Baruch College .
After the death of a student in a church ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania nearly two years ago, five people are being charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity at Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a baptism in September 2013 and police say the fraternity failed to deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
Authorities say the victim was blindfolded, had a backpack filled with nearly 50 pounds of sand placed on his back, and had been repeatedly attacked as he tried to reach a target on the other side of the icy field.
Deng reportedly complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
Police say that the Pi Delta Psi members did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they allegedly waited for an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Police Commissioner Chris Wabner told a news conference that members were still able to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the union's president, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide equipment, putting the benefit of the company above the health of Michael Deng", Wagner said.
The dengue was not resuscitated, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was struck multiple times on the head, upper torso and thighs by blunt force trauma.
"Too many families have been shocked by the parish's strokes, with at least one student dying each year from strokes since 1970", says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The subsidiaries and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step for the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury indicted five members of the community on charges of murder in the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with bribery and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to have accountability not only for individuals, but also for an organization that has officially or unofficially recognized the lynching", Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College suspended the department, and the national department resigned from the local department.
This is the effect of the Fed's interest rate hike.
Interest rates are rising, the stock market is booming, the stock market is rising, and the economy is in a slump.
We know that.
And we don't know how long it's going to take, how long the effects are going to last.
In the economic sphere in particular, we find in history a hint of timing.
The recession has come as far as 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted as long as 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, though not always, and the decisive factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why central bank officials have already been keen to stress that investors should pay attention not to when interest rates are raised but to how long it takes for the situation to return to normal.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
However, market participants may eventually find that any bullshit about raising interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first central bank withdrawal after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told clients.
In contrast, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a frightening shock for many.
But that doesn't mean there aren't consequences.
Examples of how the effects can be seen in different sectors of the economy, based on historical trends, are:
As has been observed in the markets for about a month, the need for interest rate increases may increase volatility for some time.
When the cornea finally rises, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be a stagnation of capital gains after the first increase for 12-24 months, perhaps reflecting a delay in monetary policy, a Deutsche Bank analyst noted in a recent study of the consequences of rising interest rates.
"Over a 35-year time period, the market tends to see a sharp rise in interest rates during the rise, about 14%, a fairly steady rise for the next 250 days (an average increase of 2.6%), a normalization after 500 days, and an average yield of 14.4% after six stock trades", says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on equities tends to intensify at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income starts to decline.
The recession is a fact of the economy, but rising interest rates usually do the trick.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist before and that could accelerate the rate of decline.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest ever in view of the central bank's policy rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 is forecast to be 3.6 percent, many did not expect it to last, and in the third quarter, the rate is expected to be 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
The Commission's proposal is to increase the number of EU citizens who are entitled to vote in elections.
Market participants have been talking about raising the key interest rate all year, and eyes are turning to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the FOMC were to approve the withdrawal at this meeting, the futures market shows only a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lifting cycles to date have been in a supercycle, where even before the downturn, GDP that is in a downturn is rising very quickly after the upturn", the report states.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession.
This is clearly the longest cycle the Fed has waited since the last recession, which was 35 months, and now it's approaching 74 months.
Fixed income securities have also been volatile in the market, with a tendency to yield yield, and the pattern is also repeated in the equity side.
'The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds is more rapid than on equities when the central bank changes its rate.
For bonds, the yield appears to change direction immediately after the first up/down cycle.
At the end of the Noykusl, profits immediately decline", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the interest rate will bring the long- and short-term bonds closer together and the curve will flatten out.
"High-yield bonds often fare better in this environment, although we are still cautious about yields", said Kathy Jones, a real-estate securities analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones says the markets have already adjusted to the central bank's upcoming reversal.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the forecasts of inflation, there are already several signs of a tightening of monetary policy", says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have widened and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of a market in which the central bank is tightening policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mainly in the US market will benefit from lower interest rates and the attraction of local products.
The outlook for indebted multinational companies is weaker, as a strengthening dollar makes their products more expensive in global markets and their debt more expensive.
"History shows that quality stocks are the most profitable in the three months following the yield increase", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their clients.
After the interest rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004, firms with strong balance sheets outperformed firms with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks also performed better in terms of quality, by an average of 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"The debt is a big question.
The companies with the most variable-rate debt are the ones that lose the most", Goldman noted.
Consumers outside the stock market also generally benefit from a stronger dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are felt.
The BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for being too popular.
Bingham says that it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial rival.
He also claims that the BBC Music Awards are a copy of the Brits.
Damien Collins, a member of the House of Commons, blames The Voice for being impersonal.
According to a senior MP, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of Classic FM, and the accusations add to the pressure on the station to prove that it is also providing any other commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's board that the broadcaster's radio channel was becoming too populist and no longer distinguished from its commercial rival.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be moving towards Classic FM", Bingham said.
Bingham also criticised the BBC Music Awards held last December:
"The BBC Music Awards, which were held for the first time last year, seem to be a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of what is already on the market being copied rather than new and different", says Bingham.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, stating that BBC Radio 3 had a much larger commercial competitor offering live music and educational content.
"Radio 3 taught me about classical music in a way that I could never learn from any other station.
The channel's commitment to live music and making music is in a class of its own.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and to ordering new works,' said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said the station had to work harder to keep the public interested, as Britons were becoming more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only channel to have been heavily criticised for its involvement in the commercial channels in the hearing by the BBC's restricted Culture, Media and Sport Committee.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised the BBC's acquisition of the talent search competition The Voice from Dutch producer Talpa Media, for an estimated £22 million.
"The program is not much discussed because it is not unique or particularly distinctive".
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 show, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced for the BBC in typical fashion.
Collins also urged the company to search its own warehouse for a hit show when it next launched a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to rule out the possibility that The Voice would continue to be ordered or that taxpayer money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in online trade ever in August  perhaps the reason for Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by 7%.
The online sales of the company have been tracked since 2000, and last month was the slowest month of growth on record.
The online store was strengthened three years ago with the introduction of mobile shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November may curb the shopping spree.
The takeover of e-commerce, which has been going on for more than a decade, has left many of Britain's shopping malls empty.
The Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties.
The growth in total sales in August was the slowest for the entire period since 2000 when online sales were recorded, with online sales up by just 5% last year.
According to experts, there are indications that online sales are stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to the 2000 figures, it's clear that growth is levelling off over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor-in-chief of the IMRG, told the Guardian.
Mulcahy said that the online shopping boom started three years ago, when consumers embraced mobile shopping.
"This has enabled more and more people to shop online, and many have been able to shop in a different environment, perhaps from their own home.
With mobile shopping now more moderate, growth may level off".
Black Friday, originating in America, is a phenomenon that is considered one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
Experts say that the theme day on the last Friday in November may cause consumers to postpone their purchase decisions until Black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online shoppers compared to the normal number of shoppers, many of the websites of the shopkeepers were down.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which makes consumers rush to buy, may curb the desire to shop at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, for every five pounds spent online, a fair pound was spent online.
Over a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are bought online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in street stores.
Mecca is buried with the victims of the crane accidents, the Bin Laden family,
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 victims through the streets as the first funerals are held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has accused the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group of being partly responsible for the accident.
The Ministry of Health also said that 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane that crashed into the Grand Mosque in Mecca
Crowds of people dressed in white gathered in the streets to bid farewell to the victims on their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
A procession of mourners passed through the pilgrimage site where a collapsed scaffold had just the day before broken through the roof of the mosque and overrun the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia has claimed responsibility for the bin Laden family's construction company in a disaster that left 394 people injured.
The bodies of 29 victims of the crane accident at the Grand Mosque of Mecca were transported through the streets.
Among the dead after the fall of the mosque was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had made his first pilgrimage to Mecca.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were about to embark on their annual pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised to organize the Hajj pilgrimage, as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
King Salman said that the Binladin Group shouldn't have left the crane's hoists up when the crane wasn't being used.
According to an Arabic-language press release, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language news service did not report the details of the case, but according to the English-language press release, the group's management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where thousands of Muslims are heading for the Grand Mosque's Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Commission has not received any information from the Binladin Group regarding the lifting accident and no representatives of the group have been contacted for a comment.
The king also accused the group of not following up-to-date safety regulations and of not cooperating with meteorological experts.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of a huge construction project by the Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has had close ties with the Saudi ruling family for decades, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade boy who was abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane accident, which occurred in heavy rain and strong winds, occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, an obligation for every able-bodied Muslim to make at least once in their lifetime.
Authorities say 158 people are still being treated in hospital.
Authorities ordered a payment of one million riyals (about €250,000) to the relatives of the victims and the permanently injured.
Any other injuries suffered in the accident will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says the phenomenon is due to cheap Eastern European labour
The British are hiring domestic servants more and more, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity of skilled, professional workers from Eastern Europe has been added to the list.
Over 200 new Screwfix stores for working men are opening.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores around the country.
The text by Rupert Steiner, correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is said that the British are transferring home hammering and painting jobs to artists coming from Eastern Europe.
The skills of hammering and painting seem to be rare today.
"The British are increasingly hiring house maids to do the housework", says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home improvement stores, says the phenomenon is fueled by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at cheap prices.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 new Screwfix retail stores, while 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female employees at B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions at the store are made by women.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
Lauryn says that population trends are worth considering, since a growing number of single women are also renovating their homes.
"Our stores are still mostly staffed by men", says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchases are made by women.
Women have a significant role in the decision-making process".
Laury is one of five women who are behind the British FTSE 100 and has also reorganised the company's management team to have a gender-balanced board.
Kingfisher is almost unique in that its staff is almost 50% women, including the CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision, diversity is an important issue for us", Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board".
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales numbers are down, despite the company's hard work after the store closures.
Kingfisher is responding to current trends: it owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp-edged head of the SAK and other employers' associations began to be forced to the ground, and as a result the country is on standby on Friday due to a massive demonstration by workers.
A fair number of people feel that reason is involved.
We're gonna ask if it's worth the strike, when it's already going badly.
There's even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they will not participate in the protest but will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to openly declare oneself a bankrupt would have been political suicide for a small person.
The protests of a few tens of thousands of people by millions of trade unions are not very moving, but they do give us something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is not as clear as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone is familiar with the movement's goals.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement's activities, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seeming to be on their own, unions are finally getting to the point of defending the worker's rights, in a visible and dignified manner.
The government may thus unwittingly strengthen the role of the labour movement, as union membership may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one may think of the actions of the NGOs, it is absurd that the demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product continues to fall, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think that would be a thing that would force everyone's mind.
A major savings plan for the University of Lapland: 8.5 million to be saved, 130 staff to be reduced
The Lappeenranta University of Technology is embarking on a cost-saving exercise with the aim of cutting costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start annual consultations for all staff with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means the reduction of about 130 employees.
The other activities are aimed at saving another two million.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the actual operating costs of the airport, but that the airport's annual operating costs are estimated at EUR [...] per passenger.
It is also affected by budget cuts by the government.
This fiscal year, the university will be about 2.6 million short of its budget.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and the other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in the supplementary financing is showing itself in new dimensions.
The negotiations with the trust men will start next Tuesday and will last for the six weeks the law requires.
Onnibus wants to join the Finnish railways
The owner of the bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, a British national, told Yelle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in joining the Finnish railway.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is the suburban transport in the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After the short-haul, we'll have the long-haul.
Souter says he's already approached the transportation department.
The Department of Transportation, according to Yelle, would welcome Onnibus's plans.
Among other international companies, the interest in rail transport has been expressed by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe.
The time of the US central bank's interest rate decision
The world is watching the Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, when a decision will be made about a possible interest rate hike for the first time in almost a decade.
More than half of the economists who last week believed the central bank would raise interest rates now expect the central bank to maintain the rate at the current level of 0.25%, according to a Reuters poll of 80 economists.
"This is a historical situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start normalising interest rates", said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The economy of the United States has been in relatively good shape, and the bailout has brought billions of dollars into the balance and has only slightly boosted inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not so rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The man who shot at Delta State University left a note apologizing for the shooting.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting a colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message apologizing for the first murder and hoping to undo it, authorities said Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social studies at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday and said he shot a man.
Lamb called 911 and asked the police to come to his house.
"I shot my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that there was a friendly dog in the house, who was not harming anyone but was probably frightened.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he wouldn't tell them.
He also didn't give a motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the crime scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, along with a handwritten note from Lamb that read: "I am very sorry and I hope I can undo what I did.
I loved Amya, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police caught up with him.
University President William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly upset.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss was romantically involved with Schmidt, but authorities said Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of a love triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had been divorced for 15 years, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
He said his mother and daughter were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, said that Prentiss worked online from her home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told her about a woman with a dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others", Knowles said.
Police say Lamb called his relatives Monday night and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the university's website, Lamb received his doctorate in educational leadership from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The stars have risen
The last few years have been difficult for the actor (pictured left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, she battled leukemia, and in 2009, her longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actress has also struggled with substance abuse, and in 2008 she was arrested for possession of narcotics.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Luke Shaw , Manchester United , sidelined for months after two fractures .
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in Manchester United's Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will be forced to sit out at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still optimistic and believes Shaw will return to the field this season.
Shaw, 20, was injured in the PSV defensive zone by Héctor Moreno's poor tackle with fifteen minutes left in the game.
Shaw was on first aid for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he could be transported to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his foot and is in hospital", Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
The 18-year-old, who joined Manchester United at the age of 18, has been through some tough times and is now injured after a spell of great games.
In the wardrobe, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm no doctor, but when he breaks his leg in two places, he's gonna be out for six months and never play in the playoffs again.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten away with a little bit of a red card, but there was no penalty.
The referee of the match, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal says the Italian referee made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I think the situation was worthy of a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-legged holt-on-holt-on".
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, I cannot express how devastated I am, my recovery starts here and I will come back stronger".
More on this: Manchester United's Luke Shaw sidelined for the PSV game
The English defender has a special reason to recover to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very serious injury", said the PSV coach.
"In situations like this, all parties are always very sorry.
The players never intend to harm the opponent".
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against the Netherlands, who were defeated by Van Gaal in the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry, because he did not mean to hurt the opponent. It is sad to hear that the injury is serious", Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation myself.
I just saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle".
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult a situation like this can be", Moreno told SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm really sorry".
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know more about the Lorax than I do.
Every parent soon notices that a child is learning his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for the one you saw with David Cameron.
When the children's holiday association asked Cameron to name his favourite children's book, the prime minister chose Lorax, a 1971 environmental education story by Dr. Seuss.
In a post on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult: "The story is funny, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message, and I love reading it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have not noticed before".
Sounds good, except the next part where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is the summary of the 2012 movie version, which added new characters and details to complement the short, gory opening text.
"In the town of Tarville, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by realizing this greatest dream: to see a real tree", the text says.
If that is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partially identical to the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It begins: "In a city of the poor, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him. Kerskanen's eagerness to destroy trees and make the Tarviks from them over the objections of the titular character Lorax, a small and thick, mustachioed creature who protects the forests.
It is likely that a low-level PR job like this is entrusted to a sidekick, apparently someone who has not read the Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps declined to comment further, but confirmed that the text was in the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being out of the England team, but it's still tough.
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the last 3-0 Test series defeat is not to be expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a win for the visitors.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong  they have no bad experiences from 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a batsman, Moeen Ali develops as a wicket-keeper, and Adil Rashid, although lacking Test-level experience, represents the attacking substitute.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out of the team is obviously difficult for me to understand as his head coach at Yorkshire.
In his seven Tests, there have been two good attacks against challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged by their results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I've said before, players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point games would have kept him on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits more runs for Yorkshire.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he didn't perform as well as he could have, which doesn't surprise me, because he's a team player first and foremost.
The question of how long a Test batsman is allowed to make an impact is a difficult one.
Lyth had seven home runs, as did his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton had nine.
Compton was the only one who got a chance to play both home and away.
The only complaint may be that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean when Lyth was in full swing but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter that I hold in high esteem.
He's the unknown-performer cricketer we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
There's been some talk about Moe starting the batting order with Cook, which would put an extra round-up in the game while keeping four fast bowlers, and I'm not opposed to the idea.
I see no reason why a top-order batsman should be batting here, and this left-handed batsman has already proved himself to be a great cricketer.
Moe may not have done much for his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been the team's third baseman, and that's not much of a difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as a first-class substitute before making his debut in 2001.
He scored 300 points in one game and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup quarterback, and from what I've seen of him, he's proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics  he averaged 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a reliever  and this could be a shot, but not many of the relievers have shown up, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He's gonna learn a lot on this fight tour.
Outside the playing squad, England seem to have made a few smart choices with their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a Test match adviser may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most charming men in the game, and he brings with him a wealth of experience, having played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming to the White Ball section of the game, bringing with him both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he's always had a proper impact on international cricket, whether it's his role as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has a brain to draw on.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if it's saying the same thing as before, can be a little bit of a refresher.
Colly's Durham teammate, Ben Stokes, has rested for the one-day matches, Root had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Though not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not set the game schedule.
And it must be remembered that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These are decisions that are never made without thinking.
The Brexit camp can win if the economy is bad in 2017.
The half-hearted renegotiation strategy of David Cameron on Britain's EU membership is getting deeper every day, even without the pleasingly 'yes or no' Jeremy Corbyn, elected Labour leader or the TUC, mocking Europe, in a loud voice on Tuesday.
Other countries have their Corbyns and Nigel Faragens.
A European diplomat recently explained how the EU is involved in many crises, even though not all are of its own making. e Member States are fed up with the UK's self-serving agenda, which includes divisive concessions and damaging Treaty changes that they do not really want.
At the annual TUC congress in Brighton, it was decided that they too would not be comfortable with the EU if it undermined social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral meetings in capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without dignitaries, return home and tell of the allies they have acquired for reforms.
It's all about me.
To my European friend who wants a broad-minded Britain inside the EU tent: 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin, suggesting that more and more of the short-sighted ministers and officials in the various capitals have reached the point where it no longer matters whether we stay or go.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is a moderate, is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave before it is spoiled, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is up for re-election or a successor in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them running off to help the selfie-Britons who could better use their energy trying to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they don't want to, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may be planning to make deliberately useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK's 2017 general election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a setup, and Britain had no say in the renegotiation".
Europeans know how the British press is biased towards Europe and how the EU-sceptic oligarchic press is, just as Tony Benn is biased against the 1975 referendum which voted 2:1 in favour of joining the EU in 1973.
Some of you may recall Boris Johnson, the European opportunist with a beard, who became known as "our banana-splitting correspondent for the EU" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax evaders, phone hackers, and the pseudo-temporary squatters who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought pretty much the same thing about them, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a decoy so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Miliband was also a Blairite, opposing the referendum, and he agreed to the EU constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in a 2005 referendum, Blair was handily freed.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday, I told him he had no more time to waste on me, and there was a danger that he would adopt the media boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, which was a mistake and still is.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dealing with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call "constructive".
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory can probably answer this in the affirmative.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Benniitti" Benn said on radio and television this week, as her inner party polarizer tried to avoid admitting that it was a bad move for Corbyn to appoint the tough-as-nails John McDonnell as Shadow Treasury Secretary.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when her old dad had a hard time being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his seat in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the progress of the negotiations with the United Kingdom and to provide a summary of the progress made.
As brilliant as Corbyn's message was, it's important to remember that he touched me, too, and that's important in the 24/7 age, especially in the social media frenzy of paranoia and deception.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be able to adopt a decision on the matter by the end of the year.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
The McDonnell/Corbyn equivokation on EU membership is in line with the anti-capitalist and anti-island economy of the past. e debate is no longer confined to a small circle of left-wing dissenters for whom the idea of 'like unites' is a key doctrinal point in doctrinal arguments.
The echo-vocation has also been seen in NATO, with Tom Watson being uncompromising in that Corbyn is not campaigning for an exit, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the issue at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they have doubting voters, why should they make concessions to Britain when all of it can be for nothing?
The United States has already been quite disappointed by the British military's poor performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the Tory government's cuts, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the UK authorities' statements on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of the state-funded institute that the burning of e-cigarettes is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking were made at a meeting attended by 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry.
The experts criticized the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE), the public health authority.
PHE described the report it published last month as "a groundbreaking and comprehensive review of the results".
However, several researchers have questioned the accuracy of the data and have pointed out the connections of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet Medical Journal last month described "a remarkable hepatic foundation" for teeth, on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have pondered whether the claims are based on "rock or sand" in the BMJ.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness".
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that 'at the best current estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes' should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the research findings.
The claim arises from a meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model based on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to unify participants' views on the harm of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting was supported by EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previous independent research was reportedly funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the CEO indicated in the Sustainability Report his support for BAT's public health activities.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but did not provide the said earlier funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The selection criteria for the panel have not been clarified, but there are a number of well-known e-cigarette advocates, some of whom admit to their involvement as industry funders.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Tobacco Officer.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no conclusive evidence of harmfulness of the products for a wide range of products and their compliance with the criteria.
However, no mention of switches or shortcomings in the PHE report.
The PHE report says that so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers, and McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the director of health and well-being at PHE, the allegations have been answered in the past.
Fenton claims that e-cigarettes are far less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke in their lifetime die from tobacco dependence.
All evidence points to the fact that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional cigarettes, but the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE has a duty to inform citizens of what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially in a situation where the relative dangers compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths a year, and smoking costs the public health system £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a safe alternative, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 chief executive
The BBC's Channel 4 chief executive, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit soap operas such as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson says that the licence fee should be used only to produce programmes that other television stations do not produce.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach smaller audiences at the same time as competitors' programmes with large audiences, and for example on BBC4.
After the BBC's chief executive, Tony Hall, had announced that the company wanted to increase its partnerships with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years to get Channel 4 to work with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that are clearly part of the programme of a competitor channel", Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee, which was considering the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to maintain a broadcasting licence, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least limit its offer to programmes which are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is broadcasting The Voice at prime time because it wants to see the broadest possible support in the future.
If no other channel cares about the show, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't see why regressive taxation should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidies", Johnson said.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, even though it's an independent production.
A lot of networks would give their right arm for that.
I don't understand how this serves the broadcasting company's needs.
I don't think it would be a loss to the BBC".
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 and he believes the BBC is attracting good viewers because it employs ambitious people and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments about the BBC's most popular series are in line with those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart piece that the BBC should sell off shows like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's niche programmes are shown on BBC4, where viewership figures are often unmeasurable, but the programmes serve their purpose. "The BBC can say in its hypocritical defence of its £4 billion broadcasting mission that it has done special programmes that nobody has watched".
"The BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them".
Of the broadcasting fees, Johnson stated: "I challenge you to find another in the sense of an equally old-fashioned system, in that who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks £150 a year is cheap, but people who are paying a lot of money, especially if they don't watch the BBC much".
The committee also welcomes the Commission's proposal to make a new approach to the fight against fraud, which is based on the principle of the protection of personal data.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to chemical substances at work is based on the principle that the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to such substances should be ensured by the use of a method which is compatible with the principles of good manufacturing practice and good environmental conditions.
On the issue of collaboration, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts of events such as the Proms festival, which only broadcast a fraction of its concerts last year. 'The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make all its content available online,' he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sonogenic sound waves
The video shows how the chocolate moth changes direction when ultrasound is applied.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically engineered nervous system that can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle boats change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound at a frequency above the range of human hearing.
The sound waves activate motor neurons, which are genetically engineered to have a carrier membrane that responds to ultrasound.
More on the subject: Researchers monitor brain activity with light
According to the researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the power of a new sonogenetic technique called dubbed sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells by stimulating them from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS), an invasive treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in which electrical impulses are used to stimulate the brain.
Although the worms do not normally react to ultrasound, Chalasani found that when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles, the worms reacted.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles are amplified by ultrasonic waves that travel into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the cell membranes of worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To be able to guide the worms by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms to have a TRP4 ion channel that could be accessed from the nerves that control their movement.
When the ultrasound was directed at the altered carpets, the microbeads amplified the sound waves and moved into the carpets, setting off a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat like optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells by using light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain in question by means of photopillars, but low-frequency ultrasound easily penetrates the cell, so that ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and viral therapy, human neurons can be momentarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting in certain neurological treatments", Chalasani stated.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment on your doorstep!
The ads are a disgrace to British arms trade .
Watch the video of the Amnesty International anti-arms fair.
They're the most potent killer missiles in the world.
I'm gonna break your ankles with these carts!
The bombs!
Remote sensing devices that cause excruciating pain but leave no marks!
The cheerful sound and cartoons clearly reveal that the advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a travesty. The video was produced by Amnesty International and is meant to highlight the British government's attempt to sell arms to the oppressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) trade fair, which is being held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in London's Docklands.
More on this: DSEI stations: authoritarian regimes coming to London
Also, signs demanding a second glance are posted at bus stops and on subway trains.
"Important information: does the metro run on 15th-18th September?" The sign looks like a London Underground sign, with a picture of a tanker on the other side of the line.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked to help stop the parade".
The 300 posters are by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters around London with a £6 "advertising hacking package" containing a set of six-digit keys that it claims gives access to about a third of the world's bus stop advertising boards.
Transport for London is not laughing at poster vandalism.
One of the Special Patrol Group's commercials.
According to Cruel Designs curator Gavin Grinton, a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside of the galleries.
Artists have found that social impact through art requires that art be brought into the real world, and many have moved on to work with activists in protest movements.
One of the anti-gun posters greets public transport users on the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours, and was designed by the free-to-air advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and narrator have also done their work for free.
VCCP art director Matt Lever lamented the absence of a trade show ad and the blank on Excel's event calendar, and reasoned, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They tried to make a more realistic, vaguely corporate video, but the bright colors and animation attract more attention".
"They have done a great job and helped us to bring to light the trade fairs where the illegal trade in torture equipment is practised", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that the illegal trade in torture equipment does not take place right on our doorstep".
Perhaps the most creative aspect of the fairs, however, is the exhibition halls themselves, where exhibitors make use of the spectacularly exotic displays of their goods.
In its press release Saab announced an order for the US Army for a 'portable AT4CS RS'.
The product includes "a specially designed combat knife that effectively penetrates the target".
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student housing
I moved into a dorm 11 years ago, an innocent 19-year-old who still believed in barrette and moral relativism, and it was only now that I remembered the wry smiles of the people I annoyed and the countless, long, long complaints of others.
I can summarize the most important lessons in eight simple rules.
Moving to a new place is at its least a stressful experience and at its worst, a traumatic one.
It's easy to start ranting about the situation: you tell everyone where you are, whether you took a year off and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just a little whine, haha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask others about things.
Asking questions guides conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelids were on fire and these people were sharing the switch.
Give the others some space.
Private rooms often serve as drinking establishments, movie theaters, and public residences, but private rooms are also places where people dress, from underwear to clothing.
Don't even think about combining dating and college.
College is a tough place for introverts .
Your room should be a place to relax, but many dormitories have a social culture of moving from room to room and forming lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who longs for a place of return.
In this environment, it's not possible to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so I can recharge the energy I spent dating you".
See if any of your classmates are tired of social interaction, and perhaps you should stop knocking on doors and send a text message instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my dorm who thought that the unlocked door meant he was welcome to come in.
He saw things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies in a proper way when baking is in, so if you're baking brownies and you knock on someone's door, you don't look like a 50-year-old, a little bit of a weird case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I'll bake you something small. Smile when I'm asking you for your personalities".
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your college buddy is forced to talk to you, and a tasty surprise might leave a positive impression on them.
Of course, this requires that you have reasonable baking skills.
If you serve unhappy cooks stuffed with flour, sugar, and fat, the others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
It is also a common fault in student housing that food is not cooked.
Stealing another's chicken is stealing, of course, but can his tea spill a drop from someone else's milk carton?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get a permit, even if the milk you borrowed is a joke to the owner of the can.
I understand that it's annoying when someone makes you feel like you're being bullied, but try to be as mature as you can about it, unlike my friend at school, who used to spit laundry in her milk to punish the milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make noise when others are trying to sleep or bake.
Not only because it's polite, but also because you have to remember that everyone else is digging a hole...
In my apartment, a girl asked the person next door to turn down the volume of the music because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam that morning.
The neighbor just raised the volume.
When the neighbourhood was quiet, the girl let the neighbour sleep for two hours, went to the exam for three hours, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your college friend was your future husband, and then you started dating, broke up, and had to see him every day, and lost your mutual friends to him?
Of course, if your heart wants what it wants, and if your college friend is not the one, try to control your desire.
If you find, in a moment of decision-making, that someone has left his key in a room whose door is unlocked, the boundaries of teasing and bullying are more pervasive than you might think.
A good joke is fun, but one that you'll get over in no time.
Hiding something can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one likes to mess up a room with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door to another room and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don't put a blue plaster on someone's ceiling more than a couple of times.
Racist attack on a hostel for foreign students in Kittel - a building planned as a reception centre was destroyed in Salo
A racist attack on a camp for foreign students took place in Kite in North Karelia early Saturday morning.
"The police have not yet been able to identify the children, but they have been found in the dormitories of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time", says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kiteen Evangelical National University.
The windows and walls of the dormitory of the National University were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one dormitory, according to the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is the responsible teacher of the youth social responsibility training at the public university, there were an estimated ten people in the building that was the target of the robbery at the time of the attack.
"If it's the weekend and adults are free to move, then some of it could be elsewhere", says Luukkainen.
The community college has 12 different nationalities as residents.
They are students who have already been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the building that was messed up has a status.
Some of them are in adult education, some are in vocational education and some are in Finnish", says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
East Finland Police are investigating the attack as a case of personal injury and breach of the peace.
According to Luukinen, the students were given information on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for twenty-two years and this is the first time that something like this has happened", says Luukkainen.
According to the guy, the mess on the walls has already been cleaned.
The suspects are at least three men, and they were in a white car.
I think this is a juvenile weekend trick, now that this topic has been brought up.
"It's not that serious", says Luukkainen.
The hall also has a hospital with a reception centre.
It happened last week.
MTV reported it on their website Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and it said, "You are not welcome".
A police report has been filed.
Correction 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the targeted building.
The government is cancelling the Y train to Karjala, because of the passengers, "very idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karja will stop running in March.
The news upset passengers boarding the early night train at Helsinki's main railway station.
Especially the river Alasa hits the Siuntia people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It is very idiotic, because the number of inhabitants is constantly increasing and the working population needs fast and smooth access to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in an interview video with HSTV that he will come to the capital by tractor.
The rest of the New World is also changing trains.
The H and R trains running on the track will be combined to form a new R line.
The railway station at Järvenpää and the Nuppulinna station at Tuusulas will be closed.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR on Tuesday released information on which routes the Ministry will buy rail traffic from in the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be canceled throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Committee at a later date.
The Commissioner Bengtström considers that the state railway operator is a short-sighted operation.
They make the same mistakes that have been made before and they repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then you'll be sorry for it.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the Raaseporla and the Siunula, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Annina Pöyryä, from Espoo, was upset by the fate of those who traveled by train farther from the city.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their trips", he said, aching on the Y-train.
I'm sure you'll be relieved to hear that.
A new railway connection is likely to be built along the coast, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Seudun liikenne (HSL) area, i.e. as far as Kirkkonummi.
This would increase the costs for HSL, which in effect means the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices", said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is not yet possible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about 1 million per year for the Y train, and the Ministry has paid much more.
The R-train coming in at the main line misses two stations.
In contrast, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakalliou will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed nationwide.
The Ministry will no longer buy railway services on the lines Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The route Pieksämäki-Joensuu is abbreviated as the route Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The number of train runs is reduced on the lines Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotkan port and Kajaani-Oulu.
The cancellable shifts make more than half a million trips a year, compared with about nine million trips in total for the traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new contract is expected to bring the State annual savings of 12,3 million.
The contract is worth approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Capital of the Present: "Marx is worth studying"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Hakan Yrjöen, known as the former chairman of the SKP, in the book The Actuality of Marx's Capital, published today.
"She is being taken more seriously now than she has been in a long time", Hakanen writes in her introduction.
Marx's assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, its internationalization and ever-wider penetration into all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakas include Sixten Korkman, a professor at Aalto University and a respected economist.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is relevant "now and forever".
The former director of the Institute for Economic Research and the Economic Commission is not from Marseille, is he?
No, not at all.
Korkman tells me on the phone that he doesn't think of Marx as a modern economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences have become differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The conventional wisdom is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men", Korkman begins.
It's true, Marx's predictions were badly misguided.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the Industrial Revolution, he drew exaggerated conclusions from the origins of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"The important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions", he says.
Now we're back to discussing Marx's interests, like the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may provide inspiration for those who want to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological revolution", Korkman analyzed.
But what the government has to decide tomorrow, Marx is of no use.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Korkman thinks it's worthwhile to look into Marx.
"In the '70s, you couldn't read Marx", Korkman says.
"The Maoists and the Trotskyites and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more multi-faceted, and even Marx can be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's thought world - as with other classics", says Korkman.
The UN is demanding war criminals be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war, according to AFP news agency.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was released on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil tribes of war crimes.
The Sri Lankan civil war is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
The exact number of victims is also unknown.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation of the major armed offensive in the final months of the long war in 2009.
The Sri Lankan armed forces are blamed for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with men as well as women as victims.
The report also noted that the rebels have been guilty of forcing civilians and children to become combatants.
Both sides have committed murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN court because of the foreign judges.
The English yo-yo test allowed me to browse social media.
The autumn term paper, on Wednesday, had a long foreign language, predominantly English.
The English tested their skills on over 16,000 students.
And you could write a paper on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to ask ourselves if social media is making us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250 word English article could be directed to the owner of the online magazine's advice box.
It was called Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of Leelian's Finnish recliner.
She was asked for advice on how to get parents to see things from the young person's point of view.
There were four subjects in total, and you had to choose one.
"That was the hardest part", says Mia Lybeck, the English teacher at the Swedish-language high school in Porvoo, Sweden.
The third item contained only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
And Lybeck said the fourth subject was a nice one.
It was supposed to be a speech about why companies should hire young people.
"At least in our school, they have been practicing speech writing", says Lybeck, assessing the whole experience as "somewhat normal".
In the English test, the candidate was asked to answer questions in Finnish or Swedish on texts such as the adaptation of the summer squid to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
Some Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27 pupils) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn's writing continues on Friday, when it's the turn of another native, a Swedish or Finnish writer.
In the lyceums, the test is held normally, so the protest of the employees does not affect it.
The University Research Committee encourages applicants to find suitable transport links in time to reach the test site.
You can also be granted an additional time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu , a shop was robbed at gunpoint .
A convenience store in the suburb of Kello was robbed on Wednesday morning in Oulu.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothing and a face covering commando jacket.
He's a normal-looking man in his early 30s.
Police say the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and took a small amount of money as booty.
We're looking at it as a robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
Protesters opposing the government's budget cuts will blockade the center of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
Preliminary estimates suggest that tens of thousands of people may be expected.
The members of the SAK, AKAWA and STTK unions will meet at the Railway Station at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
The police on duty, in turn, are not only tasked with carrying out the alarm and other police duties, but also with securing the disappearance of the giant mole.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed to motor vehicles for approximately 9:30 to 14:00.
No one is allowed in the area except for emergency vehicles.
The traffic in the direction of Hakaneemi is stopped at the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, in the west direction from Mannerheimintie.
Is the Helsinki police department fully staffed, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, it looks like enough.
I'm not gonna take sides on police work-related issues.
Support groups from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki for the protest.
The police won't give us the exact number of patrols.
"There is some coming, but for the most part we are on our own", Kujala says.
Police are advising people to avoid driving in private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jams will be from the Hakaniemi plateau to the nuclear site.
Traffic is expected to be stationary from dawn till dusk.
With the demonstrations coming from other parts of Finland, many special order buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed on the railway.
The buses will be far enough away from the starting point.
The final route is then to walk to the protest site", Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop the public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there's a silver lining.
The issue of mass transit fluidity, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings, now takes care of itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of people opposed to the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
They are ordinary people, employed or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,' Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Fridays in various parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is in many ways extraordinary - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organized by the unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no good point of reference for this in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
No wonder the ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisiene says.
The far-right government has attacked the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's crackdown on the contract law is a violation of the law.
There are many features here that are really trying to get the ay-movement on its knees.
And the ay movement has a mirror-looking part.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the labour movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division that the demonstration will create in the crowd that the labor movement would like to participate in.
The unemployed from all over Finland showed their views in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for the Friday demonstration, it could be the demonstration of the unemployed giants, Murrostorstai, which was held in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the "Scrap Tuesday" rallying 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Aho (centre) government is stumbling from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earners' organizations had never been so bad as during the Ahon bourgeois government.
The government and the labor movement are now even more at odds than they were in the days of Murrostorstein.
"We have the most bourgeois government in Finland", Siisieninen says.
The current government coalition is interesting in that it is so strictly right-wing despite the rhetoric of the Finnish far right.
Even in the early days, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Thousands of demonstrators are expected to gather on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transportation and may close day-care centers and schools.
Even if the protest doesn't receive the undivided support of the salaried, it may become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been organized in Helsinki every year.
There's a lot of them.
Traditionally, the Finnish labour movement has been quite peaceful - although its activities have become more violent in recent years.
Traditionally, in a Finnish protest, we avoid conflict, we obey the law.
Protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
But the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest has changed.
The EU membership made the farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
The pilots and flight controllers, among others, also wore visible patches.
Remember those strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical failures of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
The strike of the metalworkers was attended by 70,000 metalworkers.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the conciliation committee after seven weeks.
The metal workers got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, a blackout lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
The 1993 earthquake
On November 4, 1993, some 20,000 people, many of them unemployed because of the recession, gathered outside the House of Representatives to show their support for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest of the 1990s, if not the longest nationwide strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police officers were caught in a chicken shower during farmers' protests against the EU in 1994.
"Cyprus teaches, EU quits", was one of the slogans.
The farmers in Espalle poured tons of snow.
The 1999 EU summit in Helsinki also led to farmers protesting and burning haystacks in front of the meeting place.
The managers went on strike in 1983 and 1995 .
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was shaken by a few deaths during the strike.
Threatened to strike and mass excommunication of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass extermination finally brought the negotiations to a head.
The Doctors ' Strike of 2001
"Doctors on strike - force it!" was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by the doctors of the municipal health centres and hospitals lasted for five months and generated a lively debate on how the strikes could jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
In 2013, some 5,000 students marched for student aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the House of Representatives.
Central Criminal Police investigates the background of a Finnish gang full of refugees for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a registered refugee in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
All the people on the corner were in good shape.
We've had a little exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility will be on the scene in Austria, says Commissioner Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees in a truck in Austria suffered a more tragic fate.
All 71 on board apparently died of suffocation.
Yleisradion, which first reported on the cooperation with the Austrian police, said the truck belongs to a Finnish company.
The company is engaged in restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, aged around 40.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for smuggling people.
A captain who beats up refugees, a former drug lord and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
The rich king of the smugglers, the violent boat driver, the style-conscious preacher, and the self-righteous cab driver.
For example, these people are involved in human trafficking into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their 'clients', and their book Death Travel Agency is being published this week.
In the book, they present the key players in human trafficking, present their solutions and present the traffickers in the different stages of the business.
HS is presenting five of them.
I 'll take the guesswork out of them .
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia are not a popular destination for foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for their summer vacations.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attayan, lives the Emir, a chained captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their lobsters, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
Emir has done it hundreds of times on his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
Emir earns about €8,000 after expenses for one trip.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, things calmed down until the refugee crisis again rocked the country.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is served in such a way that the customers survive.
The cost of accommodation is about 75 euros per night, and if the client runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll take the boat out at midnight.
The first night, we drive off the islands, then we stop, wait for daylight, and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves as high as 65 feet [20 m], the passengers cry and vomit.
The cargo of people will be unloaded at the destination in half an hour and the Emir will be on his way back.
The Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he beats up his clients, or at least claims to beat the living crap out of the stalkers.
In the book, he says that when he was once caught by a policeman, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I would grab customers one by one by the neck and throw them overboard", Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of the Sahara.
His countrymen are said to be sorry for this.
I'll beat the shit out of them.
We need to show them who's in charge here right now.
Just a regular cab driver .
Goran is just a regular cab driver in Bogovac, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The engine's running low, and he's had his best days.
But the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving, and that it's moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village and mainly families are admitted.
In the forests surrounding the center, men traveling without their families stay in tents, huts, and abandoned cars, each of which has now found or built.
The forest also hosts families who, for one reason or another, have not left their asylum application in Serbia.
Some of them also stay in private residences, but that's a public secret.
Goran finds most of his customers among the savages.
These are often exhausting - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult terrain, often mountainous and dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovád area, a hub of the great human smuggling operation, the people are exhausted.
The residents of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their business once and it's enough", Goran boasts.
He says Africans are trying to make a dent.
Goran won't like it.
Fool, fool, fool all the way.
First they agree on a price, say 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally they offer 150.
Goran insists he's a nice and good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job, helping people", she says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's a 300-mile trip, mostly on the good highway.
I hear the guys are asking for three or four times what they're paying.
Goran makes about 50 grand a year.
It's not a lot for a smuggler, but in Serbia, it's a pretty decent annual income.
Serbia has ordered that no taxis may transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the back roads and he takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and then he's gone.
A Work of Generosity
The 35-year-old Congolese is called Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where there are many Congolese refugees, and a small center to help Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that transports people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber straps of her white pants look elegantly under the low waist of her jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary is not preaching, he is organizing people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Mission's five phone numbers.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money well and mingle with the traders crossing the border.
To be granted asylum or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be told that you are from, for example, the war zone in Northern Kivu, and that you have been forced to flee violence in your home.
Often, that's true, but if it's not, the Missionary will arrange for the client to have a new identity.
The old ID card is destroyed and replaced by a new one.
The missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police will help.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy, having come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges for each step separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents with a humanitarian organization about 150 euros, and the migration process, for example, to a European country costs between 4,500 and 7,000 euros.
Other, of a thickness of
Tom is a budding smuggler, former drug runner.
A 40-year-old Irishman works a shift on the French coast at Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks bound for Britain.
He's got an Afghan living in London, a French cab driver, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in the smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually two or three people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
The cab pulls up, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's headed for England and not Holland, and cuts through the safety fence.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the job is more expensive.
When the path is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, the kind used in the kitchen to wrap a roast or an oven pot.
It should stop the police's heat scanners from detecting a potential intruder.
Some use an ice-filled sleeping bag for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves, hoping that the driver won't be caught by the rustlers, at least not until he gets to Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human traffickers.
The Turkish pirate has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the Mediterranean illegal immigration, controlling the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury-cruise scam, where a purse is rented from a Turkish port to take American or European families on a few-day cruise.
In reality, the ships are being loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of between 5,000 and 7,000 euros, first from Istanbul to a port in the sea and then to Europe.
Customers are kept in human storage, such as old industrial buildings, until it is time for them to leave.
They're just gonna stuff people into minibuses and drive them somewhere down the coast.
They are told to hide in the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the deck all the way.
The Coastguard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the fewer passengers who defecate and vomit, the better.
For one luxury cruise, Küçük earns about €53,000 after expenses.
He does not handle the practical matters himself but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other minor personnel to do the work for him.
In the summer season, hundreds of transports are organized and Küçük makes millions.
He's bought through his shell companies, land, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments he rents out.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 along with a member of the Turkish Democratic Party (TDP) and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Apparently, he's been missing ever since.
The Death Travel Agency book is coming out this week, not next week.
In his book, the American Olympic runner describes his illness and his entry into prostitution.
Three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has caused a stir in the United States.
In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton describes how she ended her career and became a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran second best in the trials.
But in the final, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right from the start and defended his lead with a furious run.
But 150 meters before the goal, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed onto the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide the year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressures to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money by having sex with men he didn't know.
She also talked her husband into accepting her actions.
Favor Hamilton's fee was $450 an hour.
He says he spent the money on a life of luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's reasons for becoming a prostitute was that he craved the same adrenaline rushes that he had when he competed in athletics.
Favor Hamilton later learned that he had bipolar disorder.
The former superstar's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he ran the 1500 meters in a world record time of 3.57.40, but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was thrilled when the federation rebuked the Norwegian skier for "straight-talking".
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has crossed the line of appropriateness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been fighting for the entire summer and autumn, as they did last year, to get rid of the athlete contract.
Although the Northug Federation has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been forthcoming for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the match, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was made with the thanks of two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski club on the rails.
"Thank you for showing your spine", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation sponsor", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northhug would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can advertise his own sponsorship.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be given the opportunity to adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take part in the negotiations with the United Kingdom.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb will not accept that one athlete has completely different rules just because he's the best.
The European Parliament has also called for the Commission to be given the right to take action in the event of a disaster.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in her career, two of them gold.
He was on the team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
The Nordic countries also celebrate the Day of the Tortoise-Turtle
On the 25th of September, the competition day, there will be a number of events in restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Breadwinner's Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of Finnish food expertise and to lower the threshold for entering a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the sign as part of high quality.
At the same time, it should be noted that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but that there are top restaurants all over Finland, inspected and rated by an independent operator.
The international attention the event has received is a testament to its significance as a part of raising awareness of the shield industry and the organization.
The day will be held in Fondiks and Kantarelliks, a restaurant in Vaasa.
The restaurant in the Old Town will be attending the cocktail party.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make it one of the organization's most important international events, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
The Scared-O-Cow: Advocating the establishment of a dreaded reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre on the premises of the former Kauhava squadron, which is currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently occupied by critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, Finnish Special Networks Ltd.
According to the Kahajoki-lehti, the private person believes that the placement of the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant argues that the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former flight school and the airport, the impact of which has not been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that, in the case of Kauhava Airport, negotiations have been ongoing for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the possible presence of a foreign operator at the airport.
The issue has been discussed with, among others, the Minister of Defence, Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädi.
The private individual explains to the legal counsel that the complaint is not about the reception centre's objection in principle, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The city of dreadful was dealing with the reception center last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The EU's role in the region is to provide the necessary conditions for immigrants and those who are here, Niinistö told reporters after meeting the leaders of all the parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemä.
The President said that the concern for the management of the refugee situation united all the participants.
He also said that the EU should be able to take action to ensure that the EU's citizens are able to have access to the information they need.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
This is a very promising development in the area of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further strain the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also reportedly sidelined in the discussions.
The president's been silent on the labor market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot is closed for a couple of hours.

The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia reports that the airport operations are managed by the management during the work stoppage.
However, traffic jams and delays are to be expected at security checkpoints and other service points.
Protests block the streets of downtown Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police are reporting that the streets leading to the railway station will be closed to cars from about 9:30 to 14:00.
From Mainland Heights, cars are not allowed to drive from Kaivatu Street, Postkaatu Street or Töölönlahti Street towards the railway station.
Traffic from Union Street in the direction of Hakaniemi is directed to Union Street in the direction of Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
Police say the closing time will depend on the number of people attending the protest.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
# The subway and train drivers # # All through Friday #
Metro and tram drivers will participate in the Friday demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The railway and metro employees' association informed the STT this evening.
Most of the Alko will be closed for two hours, including the posts.
Friday's protest will also cause disruption to Post's services.
Significant delays are expected in the distribution of daily mail, amongst others.
Most of the post office's service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transfusions are being carried out despite the strike.
The aim is also to cover food deliveries, hospital deliveries and laboratory samples.
The current status of services is available on the Post website.
Most Finnish Alko's close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Pam, the service industry union, has instructed its employees to stop working between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called for the workers of the grocery store to join the union protest.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomi that they will try to keep the stores open, if necessary, by force.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual shops.
The day care centres in Helsinki are partially closed
The day care centres in Helsinki are not fully operational on Fridays, according to the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Office.
In view of the protest of the trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain kindergartens and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds will not be organised.
The 24-hour day care centres and groups for children with disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities for pupils with disabilities and autism are organised as normal.
The Early Childhood Education Department will be pleased to inform you of any changes in the program tomorrow.
Media scientist: The Owl is taking a big risk
According to the Chief Executive, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio speeches are one channel among others.
We also need a channel of direct speech like this in the future.
The EU has also called for the EU to be more involved in the fight against terrorism.
Sipilä did not want to assess how frequently the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipil, the Yellen Channel may not always be the place to deliver the news.
If the other channels sign on to the channel, we'll see.
Now, tonight, this channel is used, Owl said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio talk to the public.
The whole of the subject under discussion is rather complex and requires a lengthy explanation.
That's why we ended up in this canal, Swallow figured.
The talk will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the Yle Arena.
The frog is taking a big risk .
The media analyst hopes that Sipilä's televised speech does not indicate a more general government turn inward.
Is it a matter of taking the right to define public debate more strictly into your own hands and refusing to put questions to public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not let it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these two things are not connected.
The crowd understands that the commercial media is upset about the Owl's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not the information in a democracy.
The media's role is to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivusen says that the TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
The ant should bring something new and special to the table in its speech, so that the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech are fulfilled.
Is there more to offer today than we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if it's just going to be more of the same old, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and why Yle gave it exceptional time.
I would also like to take a risk in this respect, even if it is not a specific situation but a routine conversation amongst others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a political or parliamentary and governmental messenger, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general line.
A clever move by the hedgehog .
The media analyst stresses that what the Prime Minister leaves unsaid is also important in the upcoming speech by Mr Osip.
"We have to look carefully at what the bird is missing and what it is not", says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
The Commission has also been asked to provide the Commission with a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of consumers.
This is a way of getting a message to a broad audience without a journalist filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The ant bypasses the media and speaks directly to the public.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech, because no detailed questions are allowed to be asked.
According to the moon, it's very important how the redhead appears on TV - does he sweat, does his hand shake.
He compares the Owl to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If the swan can make a good point, it might work.
It's different than when the government is aware of something, because here you're talking to another person directly.
This is something that (US President Barack) Obama and his associates practice regularly.
It 's really extraordinary .
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's address to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said that there had been no such thing in decades as a Prime Minister speaking directly to the people.
Railo says that exceptional times call for exceptional means.
The researcher suspects that the prime minister wants to get the Finns to cooperate with the forthcoming extortion.
The employers' associations are organizing a demonstration and strike against the government's actions on Friday.
The chairman of the Left Union Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.
The SDP chairman Antti Rinne (S/D) has announced that he will challenge Sipilä to the dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
It's almost six months before the election.
"You can't hide forever", Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old runaway boy has been found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms this to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer in touch.
My dad thanks all the people who helped him find it.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible amount in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth violent rage: You cause anger
Kurdish volunteer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook appealing specifically to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a powerful speech against youth street fighting.
Born in Iran and moved to Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been uploaded with videos of young people fighting in extremely violent ways.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the young people's enthusiasm.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You kick the ones on the ground, sit on top of the other and hit them blindly without thinking about any of these consequences that will follow when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
# It 's hard to defend #
Some of the young people in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heino, the fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
Namely, that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, reminds Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani reminds that in Finland there are websites that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite outrageous.
A little difficult, boys, no longer to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a guest here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for letting you be here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani is telling young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever come under any kind of racism, you can blame yourselves.
Now, think twice before you go along with that, fellas.
Amirkhani says that violent action is what fuels racism.
You're going to make me hate you in a way that I don't even like.
You're in a bad place, and you're not going to make it better, Amirkhani says.
The SAC is backing its position on the savings package .
The chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee organisation would consider the STTK's position on Monday on its alternative savings scheme.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK, the labour union, said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity target demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, believes that the board will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind it.
However, this would require the largest employer organisation, SAK, to soften its previous position.
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in a low-key manner on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SEC's working committee will be dealing with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyl, the SAK is looking for solutions "to open up the labour market" and that instead of mandatory laws, there is a need for agreements between active parties.
Lyly reminds that the proposal of Prime Minister Sipilä's government for a social contract was not accepted by the SAK.
Sipilä had previously called off the negotiations on the collective agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: The big demonstration is about to break out - "It feels a little funny to put on a fist"
It's a little uncomfortable to punch someone if you already have a paper document in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels in the labor camp vary from the plains to the plains.
Is the point of this to be to overthrow the government or to make peace with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK expressed their hatred for the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened with closure.
The plague spread to the Akawi.
The teachers' union, the OAJ, threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or day care will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, the President of the Central Staff Organisation, Antti Palola (sd), made a conciliatory speech.
He said he had been in contact with the government and was drafting an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity gap, which was being pushed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The chairman of Aqaba, Sture Fjäder (chef), was quick to announce that his soup was ready.
There was no word from the SAK office at first.
The Commission has also been asked to make a statement on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK working committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to "open the labour market".
In order to create a common representation of the employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity target.
No wonder the Pallana S.T.A.R. has a good relationship with the government of the Owl.
The right-hand man of the ball, Jukka Ihanus, the director of the STTK for social inclusion, had previously served as a special adviser to the Centre's prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the government's knowledge of Ay has been improving.
The Commission has also proposed a new system for the allocation of the budget to the Member States.
It's a little awkward to punch someone with a piece of paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m.: Added information about comments made by Lilly.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki summit.
The Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is a better host for the EU than Finland.
The autumn session of the ETSYJ Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July celebrations in Helsinki.
The European Union has also expressed its support for the efforts of the European Union to establish a European security area, which would allow the EU to play a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, to which he had been denied entry.
The sanctions are political suicide by the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia got away with it, so Naryshkin continued to spit on Finland by praising and complimenting Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am confident that the Parliamentary Assembly will be constructive and will produce positive results - unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met with the head of the meeting in Ulan Bator, Ilkka Kanerva (chef), who, according to Russian media, has already held talks with the Russian delegation.
Lock meets the real playoff monster, the "Goals in Tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue their bullfighting days at Hakamets today, as both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real painting in Hakamets today.
Tappara was in Kuopio yesterday, fighting the 3-2 Kalpa.
It was a manly upsurge, as last season's silver team was at its worst with two goals from the penalty spot.
Tuesday night was a lot more fun.
The Blues, who had started the game with a bang, had a round of zero points, and the losing numbers were also 2-3.
Tough game, goals in the net, if any play the same game as last year, lock forward Janne Lahti anticipates setbacks on the club's side.
The hero has become a playoff nightmare for the Rauma.
Tappara has won the final match of the Lukko in the previous two seasons.
Both times, the final seven will be needed to decide the game.
Last season, Lukko took the series in the fourth game, but Tappara came up in the next three and passed.
There are no major changes in the group formations except for the goalkeepers.
The two cashiers who were rejected yesterday will be given a scarf today.
With the goal of Tapparan Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lukko-tops Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
The point of view: the ace is playing a lousy game
Sporting director Toivola wrote a sequel for the head coach, who is unsuitable for the Iron Thumb, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdog has sensationally put the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, on the line.
Rocky was a huge fan, even though he lost the title game.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote the restless ash story for Pori.
The nameless, knife-wielding, shoe-wielding, all-around-the-world, has entered the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but tough-ass swimmers like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, a Porin Mattia and a Pele Peltos.
In the drop games, players would dye their heads red and cut off their foreheads.
The hope girl turned blonde.
The great TV announcer, J.P. Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The Aes took the silver that was won.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that this season's new work will function in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the Athletic Director of the Aces has built a foundation on the backs of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been shoving the guys in the back like Rocky's hogs in a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitas, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are not in the game of curling.
The hopeful has forgotten that Rocky VI will feature Iron Man as the main character.
Karri Stone has named Iron Man Sean Connery.
The Iron Man is as clumsy a lead actor in the script of Rocky as Connery would have been in the original 1976 version.
There's nothing in the Iron Man but the nickname Rocky.
The Iron Horse's game philosophy is not about rushing and playing small ball.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's one thing to play tough as a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford took on Jere Tappara of Karjala from the top of the standings.
He got two minutes and ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron Thumb put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game. It's not part of the game. The Iron Horse was furious after the game.
The A's have a strange lineup this season.
There are trains, veterans, cops and paramedics.
There are practically no key players in the best age of the game.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about the skill gap.
How much influence have you had on the recruitment process, Iron Pekka Kallio?
The events of the last season are affecting the procurement and unfortunately the market situation was quite tight, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a lot of smoke underneath.
The 1953 model, the Iron Callion, is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports car.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The three league games this season, the ace's balance is the same as the number of losses by 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen is playing the mother of Sipe Santapuk
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukan as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way it seems crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to the former bassist and director of Apulanna, Tuukka Temonen, since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but this is the first time Olga is acting in a Tuukan directed film.
Olga's role in the film about the early years of Apulanna in the film You Made Us Beautiful is the drummer Sipe Santapka's mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka is supportive of her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my real role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the part.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become very close.
They've met, they've talked on the phone, they've texted.
The cherry has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
And it's also good for Sirkka to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
The '90s were a recession, and it was really dark.
There was a pretty slim chance that someone would actually succeed, but the Circus had some intuition, and it was right.
Olga says that she had heard from Tuuka much about this youth even before the film plans.
But the parents' stories have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know about what you've been up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was very different from that of Tuukan, Heinol's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was a normal, nice girl who would have had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the very least, she could have secretly fallen for him.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuuka in the past 10 years that a big joint project does not scare her.
Everything has always gone super smooth.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
The couple in Iití, however, will often drive home at night for their young children, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole of Heinola for a month.
They have given us a very warm welcome, just asking which streets and when they will be cleared.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film
Iron Sky: The Coming Race is directed by Timo Vuorensola and has a budget of 17 million euros.
The shooting starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola is set to start shooting Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is the most expensive Finnish drama film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland was held by Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation project is also ahead of Iron Sky 2 with a budget of over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensolan and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will start shooting in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of a big budget.
I've been sick and tired!
I have such a loose feel for the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to be going to Belgium.
Even though it's a tight time, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited than that, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he tells Iltalehde.
The original budget for the film was $8 million to $10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
Big budget, but big storage too.
But you should have put 100 million into the movie because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's twisted so tight, there's not a loose end.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign today, Wednesday, and a bond offering a 4-8% interest rate.
The final interest rate is determined by the supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will repay the loan in two years at the latest.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos are back on shirts
The trendsetters' foreheads have been decorating the big logos lately.
Not long ago, fashion- conscious dressers avoided the obvious, big logos like Crocs and theirs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen as somewhat of a fad.
But times are changing.
Sportswear has become a true fashion megatrend, and old, familiar sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike have also joined the cool wave.
And as so often happens, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really cool, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or tavy fashion, where trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic outfits as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the gray basic collar, the one buried at the bottom of the cabinet, the one with the manufacturer's logo on the front, is already being worn.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable track nets, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees jerseys have made a comeback on the streets.
The Calvin Klein logo on the skirt is a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of the Versace fall brace makes it clear what brand the garment is.
Would you be willing to display logos in your attire?
A Russian politician released evidence that I was not trapped for hours in the tank hatch!
He was also a member of the 'People's Council' of the so-called 'Lugansk People's Republic'.
In recent days, Russian media have been flooded with colorful allegations that the Russian Emergency Ministry was forced to unload the Zotov from the large tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page showing him peering into the hatch of an armored vehicle in pretty good shape and, at least from those pictures, there is no question of getting stuck or angry.
It's all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside a tank, it was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, a lieutenant colonel, I served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out peacefully", Zotov told Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I didn't get drunk and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel that he was delighted with the new Russian technology in the exhibition, as he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages, admiring our technology.
And I came out the back door, he said.
I've been to every tank.
And at the next exhibition I will definitely go to all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One idiot wrote it, and everyone else repeated it.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and rotten, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen", he told the Russkaja sluzhba novotei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged drowning have been published, although the gun exhibition was visited by 50,000 people in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's being trapped was triggered by a story on the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told to have his crutch in the tank hole when he tried to get out and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his shell.
Later, Bloknot published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers gave their own views on what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply stuttered when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, the exhibition's coordinator, Aleksandr Pisarevski, told Bloknot.

There's been a leak at the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The process water from the gold mine has leaked into the so-called enrichment seepage pond.
The company has said that measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains enriched sludge neutralized by the foaming process and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or is allowed to flow through the surface treatment field into the environment.
The leakage was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
The company claims that the quality of the leaked water meets the current licensing conditions.
No other material was released into the environment.
The leak was discovered on a rounds of the building Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the pool's pathogenic structures.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs around 600 permanent workers.
The IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report, published today by the International Monetary Fund, broadly follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for comprehensive structural reforms in Finland to overcome the economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid days off would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contractual system and in the unemployment insurance system.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamaa, there is a common understanding on structural reforms, but small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of messages that are supportive of the government's actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
The Commission is also considering whether to make the necessary changes to the existing rules.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts an economic growth rate of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today forecast growth to be zero this year in its new balance sheet.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They could have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production had been up slightly over the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
The weakening of industrial confidence or other so-called softer indicators have again been able to attract less attention.
The differences, however, are only a few percent decimal places.
Nintendo , in the process of recovering from the death of its founder , has appointed a new CEO .
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked for Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata had been the head of Nintendo since 2002, and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were being raised as a possible successor to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research, to Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to bring Nintendo into the mobile game industry, but not to eat the company's bread alongside the traditional console.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Migration Agency acknowledged that up to hundreds of children who have come to Sweden disappear every year.
The Swedish Immigration Agency reports that hundreds of underage applicants are disappearing in the country every year.
The chief inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, Juha Kannelmaa, tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many asylum seekers disappear underground each year? In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland by unaccompanied minors.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, there were 196 such applications, and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The disappearance may be due to the fact that the proceedings reveal that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of age.
In such a case, it may be more tempting for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the examination of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing are also found later, when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were granted a decision to withdraw their application because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, meaning that adult asylum seekers have disappeared over the past 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of September 6, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment from harmful substances.
What about those who have been convicted?
Do they also disappear into the "dark labor market"?
It is difficult to assess this from the Immigration Office, as the police are responsible for the implementation of deportation decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered asylum seekers.
He's already taken action on the matter.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the proposal, which would allow the Commission to make a proposal to the Council for a regulation on the establishment of a European Union Agency for the Evaluation of Vocational Training (EVT) for the period 2007-2013.
Nina Mikkonen is selling the studio of Timo T.A. on the Internet - see photos of the equipment
The equipment used by Mikko Mikkosen for TV and radio productions is now on sale.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which used to be the most advanced professional equipment in the field.
The first to report on the online announcement was the online newspaper Iltamakasini.
Today, many of these devices have fallen behind in terms of technological progress.
In the digital media world, you're not going to be shooting TV shows on Betacam tapes anymore.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are people who are interested.
Of course, the hardware is not up to date in that way, but we still need them as long as there is this old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and those who build their own studios, Nina Mikkonen wonders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move out of their current home in Stormborne.
There's no way we can take all this stuff with us.
I've been slowly starting to inventory and see what items are being given away.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There's no longer any use of the television and radio equipment.
It's clear from the recent strokes that a man with a long career never returned to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
In the summer of 2001, the life's work of Timo T.A. Mikkosen was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrsk via box office.
The worst-case scenario is a traffic jam that could stop the subway and trams for the entire Friday.
Metro and tram drivers are deciding today whether to extend their force measures in the wake of Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the subway and the tram only for the Friday demonstration.
In the afternoon, we'll decide if traffic will stop for the day.
Chief confidant Pekka Hirvonen says there's a big fuss on the field.
The night and daytime cuts are causing a lot of grief among drivers, so the government's plans to cut the leashes are proving controversial.
The monster thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tramway stop for Friday, public transport in the capital region will be practically completely stopped.
According to the VR, trains do not run on Fridays between 6am and 6pm.
Friday, no local or long-distance traffic.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. will be driven to their destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are stuck in the garage.
The members of the ACP will be off duty from Friday at 3 a.m. to Saturday at 3 a.m.
The buses will probably be driven by a small number of people, according to HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly what bus routes are running on Friday.
The employers' associations will organise a large rally at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday at 11.00-13.00.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident happened on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, reports the Associated Press.
Sky News reports that the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at Texas school - teacher thinks his own clock is a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after a teacher mistook a homemade clock he had brought to school for a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the products of his electronics hobby.
But one of the teachers thought it looked like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation eventually resulted in the boy being handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center.
At no point did Muhammad ever claim anything other than that he had made a clock.
Still, there's a chance that the boy could be accused of making a bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display, with wires running between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohammedia was punished with three days of forced school.
His father is furious about the incident, and the Council of American Muslims is wondering if this is another example of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is in a state of shock - Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem
The song is a prayer to God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has been echoed by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
The EU has also been involved in the negotiations with the United States on the future of the EU.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined in on the song.
Yesterday's memorial service was to honour the British Air Force pilots who fought the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defended Corbyn and stressed that he had shown respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the speech was starred.
The election of Corbyn as party leader has split the Labour Party.
Even among the MPs, there are those who fear that he will drive away moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of austerity and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to speak in Parliament for the first time as party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what questions to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was tweeting this weekend that Corbyn is the leader of the party.
The Workers' Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his personal account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was awaiting a court case.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family murder that occurred in Greenwood, Minnesota, a little over a week ago.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a couple of days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his home.
Dead for days .
The family was found after the school was concerned about the children's absence.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for a search and found the Short family dead on all sides of the huge house.
The Star Tribune has suggested that it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million-Dollar House and a Successful Business
The investigation into the death of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur who had made his fortune on the social media site for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short stated that the site had four million unique visitors per week.
I've had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I've rejected all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
One of the successes was that the Short family bought a dilapidated house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the Zillowice real estate website as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms but also a garage for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
But according to Star Tribune, the father of the family was awaiting a court case.
She had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various pre-nursing courses, over comments made on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, the comments defaming prep courses had not been removed from Short's website and they had thus lost customers to their competitors.
However, StarTribune said it was very unclear whether the trial had affected Short's business in any significant way.

A stunningly beautiful gesture from an NHL star - "The gift of the greatest athlete of all time"
P.K. Subban, a superstar of the Montreal Canadiens, has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is the largest single donation to charity by an athlete in Canadian history.
Furthermore, 26-year-old Subban has committed to help the hospital raise funds for another seven years.
Subban signed with the Canadiens a year ago for eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual salary.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will have a hall named after him at the hospital.
Canadiens players have made a significant contribution to local hospitals before.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum for another large hospital in the city, which was equipped with a PET scanner for cancer research.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the Internet: preparations for attacks on car security
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a press release issued by Intel.
The board is made up of the world's top security experts.
The ASRB will conduct continuous security testing and reviews aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future based on the findings of the ASRB's investigation.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultancy firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road.
The same estimate suggests that between 60% and 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars, says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
The ASRB will enable Intel to establish security best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road, which is why the ASRB is the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS is worth about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been awaited for years like a moonrise.
Vdoihin's car is starting to be in the sights in Finland, too.
Ford has released the RS data as the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-cylinder RS, powered by its 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 160 miles per hour.
The price is also interesting, and is estimated to be around EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in the press release.
At the Frankfurt Motor Show , the world 's most popular brand , Kia , unveiled two new products - the new Sportage and the Optima .
The most important of the two innovations in Finland is the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to take a bigger sword in the ever-growing street car market.
The new Sportage, designed by Gregory Guillaume, the European design director, is more rounded than before.
The wheelbase and the exterior are one inch here, one inch there, and the car is clearing the air more efficiently than ever.
The engine range is essentially the same, but it has been supplemented by a 1.6-liter turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More information on the Kia Sportag and its performance and consumption is given closer to the sales revenue.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we'll have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Before the year is out, the new Kia Optima will be in our country.
At first glance, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it is a brand-new car.
The new Kia will win over the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and superior equipment.
Optimus cars with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine are available.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the Optima GT, with its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, joins them.
At the same time as its arrival, Optima Farmar will be put on sale.

Kim Kardashian's mothering style is stunning again.
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian is giving us one topic after another.
She's been showing off her pregnancy bra and bra bra bra in a sexy outfit, most recently last night at 1:00 AM, American time, when she left a concert with her sister Kourtney Kardashian and husband Kanye West.
The black maternity jacket is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the leather-colored bras underneath the dress as the flashes of the lightning flash.
The last time Kardashian wore a mother-of-three maternity gown was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black high-heeled boots.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday's, when the presentation shift was pregnant.

Every season starts from zero.
So, even though you were a top designer last season, this season is gonna start with the casting again.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces in the field, competing for jobs with the concrete.
Most models don't have a place to call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it may take years to find a place to stay in a hotel room or an apartment where the fashion houses put their models.
When you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be excruciating.
New York and Paris are the most desirable jobs, but they're also the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinny.
A New York agent might ask you to drop a few pounds, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risky business all the time.
In fashion week, the models and the designers are always together, and they also act as a support network.
When the fashion week is over, the difference is tenuous.
Models want to enter the industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are annoyed that everyone thinks that work is just a showcase for clothes.
Even models like to be themselves.
The job is to make the models feel like they're actors, like they're playing a role.
But modeling is also a way to express yourself.
You were modeling at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York City is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers are unveiling their next year's lineup.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, will play the unknown Apulanta musician in the film.
Roope Salminen portrays the band's founding member Antti Lautalaa in the film based on the early years of the band Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtas, but left the band in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I'm a rapper who's about to turn 26, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen, laughing.
I've never wanted to meet the real Ant before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of the lot, so I think it's okay that I just learned his playing style from the video.
I don't want to do an imitation of a human.
A man who believes in Roope Salminen and the Dogs will not be cast in the role.
Punk manners come naturally to a man.
I'm sure a lot of people saw the first look of the punk era on "Stars, Stars" and if you've ever been to one of our shows.
Our performance has never been anything short of a little bit of fun, but always a little bit of a blast.
The main actors of the film "You are beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulan between 1993 and 2004, were announced today.
The core of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is represented by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, the singer is Toni from Wirtas Tatu Sinisalo the bassist is Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming fling last night when he mysteriously shared on Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, seen earlier in the moustache and beard, has shaved his face to silhouette and dyed his brown hair black.
A psychologist says: "This is how you tell your children about refugees"
In recent days, many parents have been left wondering how to tell their children about the plight of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is there any point in telling?
The issue does not need to be raised by force, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Protecting younger children, for example, by not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children may not always be able to understand what they see, and it can linger in their mind and distress, she says.
However, if your child has seen news footage of refugees on television or has heard about it from someone else, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to discuss the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he or she is afraid of.
You don't want to frighten your child for no reason, even if you're being harassed and frightened.
A younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will feel secure.
Older children are likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents do well to discuss the matter with them if it concerns the child.
The fact is, not everyone in the world is doing well.
Parents and children can work out how our family will handle this.
But, in the end, do we think the world is a safe place or a unsafe one?
Parents may also have differing views on parenting - some may want to protect their children from bullying as much as possible.
On the other hand, if difficult issues are discussed in the family, the child will be given a model for dealing with the problems that may arise in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

Perttu Pohjola was able to polish Apilan's Pallosalam to support the attack in the middle of the night.
It only shook up wins and second places until the collapse of the Tampere Rave at the end of July.
As the mare was scratching her head, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered her cubs to be seen by a veterinarian.
The explanation for the blackout was discovered in a stakeout.
The horse had a strep throat.
The disease was not mild, and it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
As Apilan Pallosalama had to be on a light exercise, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE-dam in Turku after Taruntuul.
The plane was under great pressure from the Apollo after only a few weeks of normal operation.
"The small tilt at the end was understandable", Pohjola says.
Coach thinks a good competition made the bulls a little bit sharper.
The horse's torque was definitely going forward, and hopefully it would have been balanced as well.
The Apilan Ballroom has been a so-called comedy horse.
When it hasn't been entertained, it could have been fattening up without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have unleashed a mystery that has amazed their opponents.
At low speed, the competitors can't keep up with the Pallosalam, which can even give off hot-blooded rides.
The bottom line is that Vermo's a piss-off.
But the difference is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees to it.
It's kind of hard to get out there and maybe get a little bit of a bump under the bum of the starting car and stuff.
I hope the Ori will be more peaceful than when Turun left.
The Apilan Ball-Slam, when it's fit, will also come from the bow, and we'll start driving it to victory, Coach promises.
This is why you can 't get rid of the useless iPhone apps .
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. He's the one who's been doing it.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be deleted at some future time - but not all of them.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its software from iPhones in the future, Apple CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed magazine.
The iPhone has a number of applications that are relatively unused: FaceTime, Newsstand, Health, Wallet, Podcasts, and Tips.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, though it is only necessary for owners of Apple's smartwatch.
Cook says that deleting Apple software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are deleted, it could cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not specify which of Apple's iPhone apps would work seamlessly with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them", Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company doesn't want to waste the memory space on users' iPhones.
Euro area inflation down to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, by 0.1% year on year, the EU statistics agency Eurostat said today.
The price increase was driven down by the fall in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised down slightly its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9 percent in August from 1.0 percent in July.
The Eurostat forecast for core inflation was 1.0%.
The euro area's energy situation was 7.2% worse last month than a year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU-28 was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
Of the euro area countries, Malta recorded the highest increase in consumer prices in August, at 1.4%.
Cyprus recorded inflation of 1.9% at the lowest price point.
Finland's inflation rate was negative 0.2%, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains far below the European Central Bank's (ECB) objective of a price increase of 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The central bank forecast a further increase to 1.1% next year in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy .
The next US recession will begin in less than a year at the earliest, but more likely within three years after the Fed, the country's central bank, starts raising interest rates again after a long time.
And in financial markets, the downturn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it will begin interest-rate cuts as soon as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
The next recession could therefore hit at the earliest by next autumn and the price of the financial markets before then.
Or at least it will be if the world's largest economy and financial markets do as they have always done and if they respond to the Fed's extortion as they have done before.
These are the conclusions reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, the market research strategists at Deutsche Bank in London, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not claim to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different patterns as during previous interest rate increases - and what the possible consequences are.
Clearly, both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950's.
Maybe not even a year before the recession starts .
The Fed's monetary policy and its current policy makers have been hinting throughout the summer and early fall that the time is ripe for interest rate hikes.
The first interest rate hike in over nine years could happen as early as this week.
The matter will be decided during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called open market committee of the Fed's board of governors will meet to decide on the matter in its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
That was the end of exactly two years of relatively regular but low-level interest rates of 0.25 percent, with the Fed raising its rates from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 with the collapse of America's most risky housing finance company, and a year later, the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
The recent serious financial market and real economy shocks began more slowly than has been typical since the previous Fed rate hikes.
In turn, the trials were harder and harsher than ever before in the depression of the 1930's.
The Deutschen strategists have been sifting through the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the ups and downs of financial markets since the 1950s and in some places since the early 1800s.
They have been studying the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial effects since the 1950s.
The first recession lasted less than a year at the most, less than three years at the most, and less than three and a half years on average.
The financial market bull run ended within a year or two of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has alternately raised and lowered its policy rate for a dozen different cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has been somewhat different from the others and the coefficients considered are relatively few, so that they can hardly be used to make any definite conclusions about the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
And as strategists remind us, this time, many things are different.
And not just better.
You've been climbing too low for too long
Even decades of research may not be enough to unquestionably pinpoint the causes or the perpetrators of the financial crisis.
But three of the factors that have led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably fairly clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and the other major central banks in the world kept their policy rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were cleaning up the Techno plan, and growing the next one.
2) The accumulated and already excessive debt over decades in the various sectors of the financial and real economy was further increased by the impact of the excess monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born.
3) The maddening debt financing, especially in the financial sector, led to the largest price swings in financial history to date, from stocks to real estate, bonds and commodities, for most sectors of the financial markets.
It is hardly hard to deny that, with ever more complex debt levers, financial markets were in a rare dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures aligned to the debt leverage, including the valuation bubble, could not survive the period after interest rates had started rising and the cost of debt financing had turned upwards.
The risks were realized in the financial crisis, and the Great Recession followed.
A bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutschen strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give a reason to ponder by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and the other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy even more loose for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been as crazy as it was ten years ago, and now debt is at its worst literally cheaper than free.
So instead of being relieved, the financial and real-economy debt burden is now much heavier in different parts of the economy than it was before or during the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has flowed from central banks at an even higher and cheaper rate has mostly been retained in the financial markets, bringing the prices of key securities and assets to their highest levels since before the financial crisis, if ever.
And not only do the strategists look at the warning signs of the financial markets, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades to the pattern that has occurred in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
The real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but the financial market pressures and risks are far greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten the monetary policy.
Perhaps the future of Albert Edwards, the strategist of the French bank Société Générale, is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time , he has been coaching the bank 's international investor clients on the Fed 's next big changes:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's the Fed's turn to go out and put out the financial fires with even greater QE money strikes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut as many as 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be allocated to the HP business services division, the company said.
HP will split in November between Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP reached its peak in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the number of staff was reduced to 302,000.
The company records a one-off cost of USD 2,7 billion (approximately EUR 2,4 billion) from the arrangements.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to cut its workforce by 25,000 to 30,000.
The consumer side of the reduction will be 3,300 over three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries, with 60% of its workforce in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that no customer is responsible for more than 10 percent of its operating profit.
In another year, its three largest customers accounted for 65 percent of its turnover.

General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
Anne Berner (C), Minister of Transport and Communications, has been a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involved so-called tax planning.
The Commission considers that the aid granted to LuxOpCo in the form of a guarantee is compatible with the internal market.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Mr Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he notified his resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've already submitted my resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control the fact that the registration chains are running on an agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with YLE.
Membership after the merger
The Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Käshr is a parquet flooring company that merged with Finnish parquet flooring company Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Ms Yellen, the assets of Kährs are transferred in Luxembourg through a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Yelle that he accepted a board seat in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is the owner of Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, and they found one in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yale that the Hartwall Capital holdings in the company are not tax-related.
According to Mr. Berner, the complex ownership structure created in the tax haven is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of the private equity fund in Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company for the holdings.
A company-run reception centre opens in Espoo
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception center is ready to take in the first 100 residents starting at 6:00 p.m. today.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Service will set up a reception centre on the premises of the former Salvation Army.
The company is run by Luona Oy, which is active in the provision of health and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy agreed on the security arrangements for the centre.
The STK is preparing an alternative work life blackmail package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government's workplace crackdown.
The organisation hopes to involve other employers' organisations.
According to the President, Antti Palola, the focus is now on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of labour will be discussed later.
Everyone understands that life goes on after every Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters during a break from the organization's administration meeting.
The Commissioner for Economic and Social Affairs, Mr Palola, said that the European Economic Community (EEC) was not prepared to discuss the matter.
The STTK economists have calculated that the transition protection provided by the government's competitiveness package will cost employers an estimated €30 million, while the other half of the package is €2.7 billion.
I don't know if there's a huge appetite on either side to have a conversation if you're on the side of the one-to-one ratio.
Palola: The negotiating relationship was constructive
The EU's Foreign Ministers have agreed to a new EU-wide agreement on the EU's external relations policy.
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on whether the timetable is realistic.
The dialogue with the government, which he says has been constructive, is ongoing.
The staffing agency STTK, especially the Sunday shift, is a pain in the ass.
The organization requires the government to withdraw the mandatory legislation by which it would carry out some of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STTK does not support the idea of preparing an alternative package with the SDP, which is the party bringing the matter before.
Employees are gathering in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government's crackdown on working life last week.
The package includes cuts in the wages of the first days of sick leave, halving overtime payments, reducing Sunday payments to 75 percent and shortening holidays.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have called for a demonstration by the employees and that the strike was not intended.
Fjäder Akava is very pleased
The European Union is also calling for the introduction of a new system of taxation for the benefit of all.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now aligning with Akava, which has already outlined alternative models for government proposals.
The Commission is also proposing that the SAK be included in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package would not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The chairman of the AKA, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lylyn, will be involved in preparing a proposal as an alternative to cuts.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has already said on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want to have a change-over policy and a work-time bench.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of staff in the newly created posts.
Akava has always been open to negotiation, and we've been writing alternative models for the government's proposals for a long time.
We're prepared to look at the terms of service as part of the agreement.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of working time allowances for the disabled.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to produce a model that will be of interest to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The AKAVA Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same talcoots" - playing bingo while the Owl talks in the evening
Green Left Party of the University of Tampere
The Vivan Bingo Cup for the green left of Tampere University is tonight.
Prime Ministers have made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Ylen channel on Wednesday evening at 21.05 in a very unusual way.
To find the last prime minister to speak, one has to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister, giving the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälän rebellion.
After that, the president and the ministers had several radio talks during the winter and continuing war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the railroad workers' strike in a televised address.
One-on-one, monarchy style
The speech of the Octopus has been the subject of criticism and speculation all day about what the future holds.
The chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that "Sipilä could consider his State of the Nation Address in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed".
The Greens' Ville Niinistö said: "The private conversation has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist attitude: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP's chairman, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "It is six months since the elections.
Not a single appearance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We tried that.
What is the sheepdog afraid of?
The public service
According to the State Council's office, Sipil's speech was recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the comments were made on the live broadcast by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC President-General Jyri Häkämies.
You know, there's been some criticism of the way the Gull spoke.
We considered the matter and decided that it was the public service's task to promote a comprehensive publicity for the whole of Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at Ylen.
Like the days of the Tams.
The speech has also been derided.
When the evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are groomed and dressed to the best of their abilities.
Mommy puts on a pretty little coat and Daddy fixes a tie.
At nine o'clock, the TV is silenced, like in the old days of the Me Tammelo", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Can you tell Prime Minister Sipil why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their money in tax havens, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
One of the things Sipilä says is that the Green Left of Tampere University, Viva, is making a guess.
It's posted a Facebook page with a secondary message.
Tonight, will we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living together as a team, and the spirit of teamwork?
Get your vouchers and pens ready, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
The West rejected Russia's proposal to oust Assad.
More than three years ago, the West rejected a Russian offer to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN envoy proposed a plan that would, after a while, allow al-Assad to step down from power in style.
The West did not accept the proposal, however, because they believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin told him in a bilateral conversation that the plan had three points: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and Assad had to be brought into direct contact and the removal of Assad from power had to be carried out quietly.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can discuss things openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Marty, and I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting .
Ahtisaari says he passed Tsurkin's message on to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tschurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahmadiyya's claims, but said that by then, al-Assad's forces had already committed several mass killings and that key opposition groups were refusing any deal that would have kept him in power.
The former head of the Middle East department of the British Foreign Office, Sir John Jenkins, is skeptical of Ahtisaari's comments, because according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weak point in Ahtisaari's argument is that Tsurkin spoke with Moscow's authorization.
If he had told me about the speech by Mr. Churkin, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin, so I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said that even if he did, he would have suspected that it was a ploy by Putin to keep a pro-Assad supporter in power.
The stream of refuge from our own actions
During the negotiations that took place in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we ourselves have caused, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' accommodation centre in Tornio, Turkey
The asylum centre planned by the Northern Finland Government is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the vacant Tornio Community College building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki Sanomat news agency reported on Tuesday that the city council had already decided to tender the school building to the ministry.
The Commission has also been asked to propose a new regulation on the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women.
"Since the entire board was not in place and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a board meeting next Monday to decide on the matter", he tells STT.
Thirty-six of the 43 delegates were present at the debate.
The Coordinating Center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, one could expect a positive decision, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
It is estimated that the community centre could accommodate 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be used for such a purpose.
The location is a couple of hundred metres from the border, so it would be sensible, says Nousiainen.
The Owl still hopes the job market will provide an alternative to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the publicly announced halving of holiday pay would only partially reduce the government's aim of reducing the price of labour.
He said the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations could agree on one.
Sipil told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the trade unions.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for ways to compensate for the government's reported work-life restrictions.
If such an agreement is reached, we would certainly welcome it as part of the package.
The Commission has also proposed to increase the number of women in the workforce by a further two to three, and to increase the number of women in the workforce by a further three to four.
The trade unions could agree among themselves on the reduction of holiday pay, as it is recorded in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will report to the House of Commons on the blackmail of the working class in a report to the State Council next Wednesday.
According to the heron, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
The deadline is not here.
The legislative work then starts moving, that is, the train is moving and it gets more and more difficult.
Now is a good time.
"These things don't last long, if you have the will, "said the Swallow.
The government's list last week includes the change of weekend and Halloween to unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the first sick days will be reduced, overtime pay will be halved, the daily allowance will be reduced to 75% and the holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented through the passage of legislation by the trade unions, which has been the subject of strong criticism.
The workers' unions are holding a demonstration on Friday to protest the action, and several unions have called for political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the expansion of the Mahlahalli reservoir
The Tohmajärvi municipality unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse of the Nordic Koivu Oy, which is a small but successful holding company.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
And the busy schedule has been killing me.
It was also little wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the decision was taken on the previous expansion.
At this stage, the extension of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the funding will be decided later in the interim report.
The agenda was still talking about investments of between €150,000 and €200,000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, told us that the estimated cost would be €300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it would bring jobs and tax revenues to the local area.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö argued.
Even the Karelian tongue has a place in Joensuu
The city government softened its previously strong stance to bring Karelian-language cotton signs to downtown Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right, considering the importance of the Carian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelian language because it has no historical basis and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken around the river has belonged more to the eastern Savoy dialects.
After the new decision, there will be no more Karel carpet signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Kareyan language, on a case-by-case basis, for example in the information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends this approach to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worthwhile to have a broad-minded attitude to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a distinctive feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuus as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used to benefit the county's diverse marketing.
The county's life is being cut short by the railway shutdown.
The cuts to the railway network are hitting the county's workforce with a heavy hand.
The mobility links have a direct impact on the economic life and competitiveness of the region.
And that affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all, wonders Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen.
He also mentions air transport, the future of which has also been the subject of several reports.
It is important for the whole county that our chances of survival are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas:
The deterioration of transport connections will create additional challenges for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport and housing, the easier it is to get students and workers, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that even at the moment, marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult, because the cross-border connections are weak.
At present, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from Uudelta, which is partly due to the direct train connection.
The river became one of the soundtracks to the war of Siu
The Joensuu City Council's view of the Siun-sout project is apparently unanimous, but one of its members is also in agreement.
Pentti Keskisalo (pictured), a member of the city council, proposed at the council's meeting on Monday that the project be abandoned, but his proposal was considered unsuccessful.
The government approved the proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the meeting of the city council, which will give its final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola is ending next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit with fewer train queues.
Passenger train services between the cities of Kotka and Kouvola will be changed in March.
One train crew is left out, but still five times a day you get from Eagle to Cove and back again.
The shrinkage is due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' railway purchase grants for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million.
The quietest routes will be shut down completely.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climb up on the roof, one of them can't get down, the guys fall off.
The rescue team released a 12-year-old boy who had climbed onto the roof of the building, who was unable to get off the roof by himself.
The incident occurred on the Tornionmäen road at 6:30 on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
That did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb onto the roof of the house by means of the radio amateur tower next to it.
The other boys made it down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others fled the scene, and passersby alerted the rescue squad to help the last one on the roof to pull him safely back to the surface.
FedEx's turnover fluctuations and weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak results for the last quarter, with the transport sector reporting a weak full-year forecast due to a decline in demand for freight services and an increase in the cost of ground transportation.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's stock fell about 2.5% 45 minutes before the actual opening of trading on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May, a 20 cent drop from the previous forecast.
According to a FactSet study, analysts were predicting $10.84.
The forecast has been weakened despite price increases of an average of 4.9% for the year, which will take effect on 4 January, and the additional charges for the transport of heavy or large consignments will take effect in November.
The company still expects a profit increase from the previous year, due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in online sales.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, stated that the company has performed well in a weaker than expected economic situation, which has tested in particular production and global trade.
The announcement of the seasonal workers' pay plans came a day after competitor UPS announced its plans to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90,000-95,000 people.
In the quarter ended 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, an increase of 6%.
The earnings per share was $2.42, which is a flat rate of $2.44 from 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased five percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the company's revenue was expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class shipments in recent years, which has led to a downturn in the company's Express unit.
The strong growth in online trade has strengthened the FedEx Ground's earnings.
In the last quarter, turnover from ground transport grew by 29%, but business profit reflected higher costs for large consignments and insurance.
The Express business was more profitable due to higher base charges, while the freight business was less profitable due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading day, the FedEx share price had dropped $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock ended 11 percent below the average for the year and 17 percent below the highest price on June 11.
This week, the Fed's policy makers are gathering for the most anticipated meeting in years, as the crowd sits at an eight-meter-wide Honduran wooden table to decide whether it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the nation ahead of all other interests.
The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank's management has taken note of a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be the missing piece of the puzzle, as the Federal Reserve is due to announce on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to begin the process of unwinding from the unpredictable stimulus provided by the short-term interest rates that remained near zero at the end of 2008.
While most data indicates a steady growth of the economy, the recent boom in financial markets may cause already cautious central bank officials to fear increasing volatility by raising the federal tax rate by  at least a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the banking firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in global markets is enough to give them a reason to wait", Piegza continues.
There is a disagreement among the experts on what the central bank will do, which is a source of nervousness.
About half of the economists in a Bloomberg survey were worried about rising interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to be cautious and the central bank's key indicator shows a 30 percent chance of a rise.
If the central bank raises its policy rate, stock prices could fall unless policy makers soften the blow by promising another increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
"The rally was driven by expectations that the central bank would keep the policy rate steady this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the central bank were to raise interest rates at this stage", he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets from shaking".
The other experts, on the other hand, concluded that raising interest rates could calm financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be leaning towards raising interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be a small first step in tightening financial conditions and thereby bolstering the US recovery.
Yellen has said throughout the spring and early summer that she expected interest rates to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals believe economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, its lowest level in seven years and close to the level the central bank calculates for full employment.
The payroll is looking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual target of 2%, central bank policymakers noted that the main reason for this was the temporary impact of the sharp oil price increases.
"The economy can and needs to survive at higher interest rates, as long as they take into account the tight labour market situation", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were not shocked last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percentage points from its May high, and investors feared that the Chinese economic downturn would also affect global growth.
Markets have been buoyed up this month, and the Dow is now down nearly 10 percent from its May high.
The market turmoil means that the central bank's decision-makers will find it more difficult to raise the policy rate.
"The central bank's work is getting more complicated, despite what has happened in the financial markets and what news of the weakening of the Chinese economy has been circulating in recent weeks", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he believes the central bank will wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is little reliable information about the situation following the recent developments in the Chinese economy", Oliner noted.
The recovery of the global economy is not a central bank's primary concern, and should therefore in principle not affect the central bank's decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful entity in the world monetary system.
The central bank's influence over the last few years has been enormous.
In 2013, the mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank might reduce its scope of operations caused a worldwide upheaval.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring global trends, the central bank needs to liaise with other central banks and experts to have a good overview of the global economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, director of global strategy at the asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of the Richmond Regional Central Bank said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to movements in financial markets that don't seem to be connected to the basic pillars of the economy.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for the Federal Reserve to withdraw the interest rate hike, citing the 1998 and 1999 decisions as an example.
"The Asian economic crisis led the central bank to decide in three meetings to lower the policy rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though there were only limited identifiable consequences for US economic growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should only prioritize monetary stability in a major crisis, such as the 2008 financial meltdown", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest generation is nowhere near that", he said.
"In no case should we fear a rise in interest rates because of a market shock", added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and no mention of monetary stability, and until there is a change in this, I don't think we should get ahead of things".

The Brazilian Association of Pediatricians of Rio Grande do Sul promotes a healthy diet for infants
The Brazilian Pediatric Society of Rio Grande do Sul (SPRS) has developed a new way to teach breastfeeding women the meaning of a proper diet, by showing them pictures of babies being breastfed with pictures of unhealthy food painted on them.
Human breast milk is composed of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide the baby with all the nutrition he needs and can help him develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy required, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
A new study suggests that other dietary changes should be made in addition to increasing calorie intake.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven Sunrises has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to catch up to the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson flew to Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership election, which did little to improve Today's viewership.
Channel Nine's morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted from the role of Tony Abbott.
The morning show of the rival channel, created by David Koch and Samantha Armytag, was broadcast from London, with weekly specials also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The gap did not seem to matter to Australian television viewers, with the Sunrise program averaging 397,000 viewers in five state capitals and the Today program 339,000.
The number of viewers for Thursday was up slightly from last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but fell from last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise for the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, and Sunrise had an average of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was 40,000 to 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has so far averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

A notable new addition to Seven was the 800 Words new series, starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children, has reached a record-breaking 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be good enough to star in a hit series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's viewership, the answer is a resounding yes.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families (726,000) by a wide margin.
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured audiences in varying degrees.
The first half hour of the new series, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
By the second half, the audience had swelled to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers for the first half, and a whopping 720,000 for the second half.
Hot Seat had a total of 620,000 viewers.
The Chase Australian's second-night ratings showed Channel Nine that Hot Seat will be passing by as late as 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minuten, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final three think Sam Wood is the real bachelor of dreams. But who does he choose?
The secret was revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of the Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of Sam Wood's dream bachelor has been a closely guarded secret.
The three remaining women don't say a word about who got the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markos and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about their feelings before one of the three was dropped, and the women may have inadvertently hinted at who the winner would be.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed tight until the final on Thursday.
All three women praised Wood's sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity, and considered him a suitable partner for their qualities.
When women are asked who would be Wood's best mate if the last rose didn't fall on its own, their answers may be a clue as to who will take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's most suitable partner, after himself.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been going smoothly from the beginning.
"When I first came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were a good match, and I have had that feeling all through the show", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is very down-to-earth and very fun to be with", Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's a chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good match.
Mackay said he realized last week at a hometown meeting that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a race, but I was going to put all my energy into our relationship", Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he did not choose her, she replied in a puzzled manner:
"I cannot tell", he said.
"I like the other girls as much as Snezana and Lana are equal".

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Haynes after he moved to the United States, and several other clubs were interested in him after his impressive Open Day practice last year.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems to have hit the spot.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as did the man on the Australian rugby team, who scored a fly ball to return the game to a team that beat Minnesota on Tuesday by a score of 20-3 in the final.
But Tomsula showed her confidence in Hayne and gave him another chance to recover the flying rod, keeping Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued his line in the locker room after the game.
He didn't just rip off the newcomers in front of the other team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reports that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is coming off a catch in the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian crowd had expected something different from the man's NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the failure in a thunderous groan and later told 2DayFM 104.1 to Hamish and Andy that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and you have to move on", Hayne noted.
Hayne made a mistake on his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his pass in his own territory opened the Queensland seat.
But overall, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a picture on Instagram of herself posing with her fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussing gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who had openly sued President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, his oil company Yukos was expropriated, and his pro-democracy work was restricted.
Four dead after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, an official source said Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's new constitution.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district, less than 300 kilometers from the capital, Kathmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing the rubber bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive alternative, suddenly became so deadly.
It was the latest clash in weeks of protests in Nepal's southern plains, where the Madhesi people say the new provinces based on a new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe is demanding their own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of them police officers, have died in violent clashes since August 10.
This is a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very delicate in Nepal, where administration has been centralised for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have voted on the constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane center: 60% chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde.
A wide area of low pressure about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands may have a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported Tuesday.
The Miami National Aeronautics and Space Administration also reports a distinct low-pressure center between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 24 hours.
Google is raising $11 million for the refugee crisis.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that are helping thousands of people across Europe who have fled war and poverty.
Google announced the donation campaign on its blog in a very personal way.
Instead, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who shared her own story of how she was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark on trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As Europe's refugee and migrant crisis intensifies, many families in similar situations are in dire need of help.
Donations will be directed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN Refugee Agency.
After raising $5.5 million through google.com/refugeerelief, Google will donate the same amount, bringing the total to $11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is the worst since the Second World War, and is being worsened by the four years of civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
There are also people fleeing war in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

People with mild obesity may benefit from diabetes surgery
A new study suggests that mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from bariatric surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after surgery for obesity than those who receive treatment without surgery.
"It takes time to get mortality data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who discussed the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery is a procedure in which the abdominal cavity is reduced by various techniques.
Surgical procedures reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food into the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, but most studies have involved patients who are morbidly overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
The weight index indicates the weight/ height ratio, with a normal value of 18,524,9.
A BMI of over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI of over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at Min-sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two obesity surgery procedures, gastric bypass surgery and lumbar bypass surgery, to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in mildly obese people.
After surgery, the mean BMI decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
The weight index of those who had no surgery remained at 29.
In the surgical group, 36 percent of the diabetics recovered completely, and 28 percent recovered partially.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent of the patients had a complete and only about 2 percent had a partial recovery.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the group that received surgery.
The researchers also monitored the patients' haemoglobin A1c levels, which is a measure of how blood sugar levels are changing.
The researchers say that the recommended level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7 percent.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c dropped from an average of 9 percent to 6 percent.
In the medication group, the value remained unchanged at about 8%.
The hemoglobin A1c value indicates control of blood sugar levels, but the team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsun found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the outcomes of two different surgical procedures.
At five years, the gastric bypass group had a greater weight loss (18.7 and 14.2 kg) than the band group, a greater weight loss (7.4 and 5.1) and a greater improvement in haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 and 2.1%) than the band group, and a greater improvement in diabetes (46.9 and 16.7%).
The new study failed to show a lower death rate after five years, but according to a Swedish study by Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgical treatment does bring years of life to obese individuals.
In a Swedish study, obese people who underwent gastric bypass surgery had a 29% lower risk of death over 15 years than those who received conventional treatment.
Although the new study did not find a lower mortality rate, Blackstone says it did confirm that people with a BMI of less than 35 could benefit from the procedure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it suggests that surgery is safe in the lower BMI group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
Blackstone says that people and doctors should take their weight seriously, with a BMI of 27 over 30.
"We're waiting too long for people to take this seriously", the researcher said.
"When you have accumulated genetic changes in your body that predispose you to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse that".
'Not everyone can come to Europe'
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during his visit to the UK, which he gave at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
The Dalai Lama says that in the current situation, humanity must be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible to imagine that everyone could come to Europe", the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
While praising the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that the solution was only temporary.
'It is a great thing to care for thousands of refugees, but at the same time we have to think about long-term solutions and how we can bring about real peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education,' the Dalai Lama stressed.
"We must ultimately consider how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
The use of force has never solved problems", he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that by resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States was creating an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of September 11th, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution is through nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Incidents of hand-swallowing quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, poison control centers across the United States have reported a nearly fourfold increase in hand-swallowing cases among children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of hand-to-hand swallows reported to poison centers by children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly available to children, and unfortunately some of them are going to need first aid", Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hand-me-downs on purpose, partly to impress their friends and partly to be spurred on by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant because of a weak pot.
Teenagers are reportedly mixing alcohol-containing mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children may be attracted to the smell of hand palms.
"The child doesn't think that the substance is bad", Lopez said.
"Most of the attractive handmade products are freshly scented.
There are handmade products with strawberry, grapefruit and orange flavors that appeal to children".
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is 45 to 95%.
In infants, even small amounts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the hand is very high", Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskey bottles at the children's fingertips, but if hand sanitizers are frequently left at the children's fingertips, they quickly produce a large amount of alcohol".
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four delicious strawberry-scented hands at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"Her blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the normal adult's alcohol level", says her doctor, Chris Ritchey, of Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah stuttered and could not walk when she was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain injuries, as she had fallen and hit her head after consuming alcohol", Ritchey said.
"It was really scary", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have been killed.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products and disinfecting wipes, in addition to keeping your hands out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The product was considered by the health authorities to contain the deadly methanol instead of the active substance ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated as the active substance in the product information.
According to a police report, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York planned to kill a "disgusting" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products throughout the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to the manuscript and forbade it to be brought into the classroom.
The police deemed the myth's past plan to be irrelevant and ordered disciplinary action against the school.
Rumor has it, he's not a good fit for Celtic.
Griffith downplays the Celtic team's disorder, while Deila admits that the team is not doing well but believes he can make it right.
Hearts clash with the SFA for Neilson's penalty, and Warburton is avoiding January's player transfers to ensure the team's unity.
The neck of Aberdeen to the Celtics, five points.
A first-half penalty from Adam Rooney brought Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, lifting Aberdeen to a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths is downplaying the inappropriateness of the conversation.
Griffiths has dismissed rumors of a disconnect in the Celtic ranks, saying that he and his team are not under surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch league champion.
"I don't think we have any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the game.
The Dutch miss the old Scottish fighting pair  de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they can no longer watch the Celtic-Rangers double.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team manager, said: 'The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown in the Netherlands.
Because the Rangers are no longer in the game".
"It's not just about the Rangers coming back.
This is the Old Firm we're talking about.
The Dutch are missing the team-to-team duel.
There is a great deal of excitement in Old Firm's games and they are of interest beyond the borders of Scotland".
I'll turn this around, Deila assures me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic are having a hard time, but the Norwegian is convinced that the situation will change.
Malmö's losing side were relegated from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic have had difficult periods before, and we will rise again", Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes many to feel anger or sadness.
So are we, but we have to move on.
We desperately need the support of Celtic fans, because it's a great way to empower the players.
The spirit of unity is really important now".
Warburton cautious in January's transfer
Although it's only been a few weeks since Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January player transfers, he is cautious about the transfer fee and says he wants to jeopardize the unity of the team.
"January transfers are significantly different from summer transfers", said the former Brentford coach.
"The players who join the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been a success in our line-up this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary signings can do more harm than good to a team".
Michu, thinking about retiring, with his eye on Celtic.
Swansea forward Michu has been linked with a move to Celtic, and has hinted that he will retire at the end of his contract with the Swans.
The 29-year-old's been a bit of a sore loser for years, and he failed to secure a transfer from Wales this summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA
Hearts led 2-1 after Paterson was sent off, and the team eventually lost 3-2 after the defender's red card was later revoked, the third red card for Collum in eight months to be revoked.
Neilson, however, stands by his words. "I did not question the integrity of the performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded after he admitted to leaking defamatory lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh home game at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming up and the atmosphere was very intense", said the striker. "I can guarantee you I will not go back to Tynecastle unless I join Celtic".
The Tannadians' management team believes in Dundee United's coaching leadership.
Simon Donnelly has assured the Dundee United management team that they can turn this situation around and that there can no longer be a trade-off on the pitch.
"Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're getting the boys ready for battle", Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to win Hamilton in a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton for their seventh successive league win, a win which took five points off the Celtics at the top of the table, thanks to a penalty from Adam Rooney in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that has not won these games", McInnes said.
Unemployment stagnates in Scotland, rises in the British Isles
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged at 4 July, at 164,000, while the unemployment rate in the whole of the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 over the same period.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent, compared with 5.5 percent for the whole of the United Kingdom.
The number of people in employment in Scotland is now 2,612,000, down from 12,000 three months earlier.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, compared with the average rate for the whole of the United Kingdom of 73.5%.
Commenting on the recent figures, Scotland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Mundell, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy".
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market in Scotland has improved over the past year and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I watching an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there's a legal basis for a recall, I'll be attending the execution.
If the execution goes through, which I don't wish to, I'll be sitting in the execution chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January I received an invitation through his best friend, and despite my shock, I accepted the invitation.
As the day approaches, I am terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a way to tell the true story of the death penalty.
It would be a unique perspective.
Reporters get to watch executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than places, participants are selected by a random drawing.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reporters from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will observe the execution with moderation.
I can't do that. I can't do that.
I'm sitting next to Richard Gloss's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've spoken on the phone several times over the past few months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a reporter, so I cannot bring along a notebook and a pen to take notes.
I just have to try to get the details in my head.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
"Telling the condemned man's story in a way that pleases him, you will be able to get close to him".
I told the reporter I had a different opinion.
The reporter admitted that she could have been more careful in her wording, but she still felt that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossop has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can take me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to cover the story.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will further the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a writer for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about this, you can listen to my podcast.
I'm not going to go into details here.
I cannot say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of aiding and abetting after the crime.
However, I believe it is highly probable that Mr. Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I strongly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this vantage point, I'll be watching his execution.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
A neutral profile can read about other journalists' stories.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a water-logged police chase.
The constable of the Canning Valley area kept dry while luring the man up the Canning River.
The Perth man's escape attempt plunged into shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few yards away was able to land the man back on dry land.
Canning Valley Police received a call Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When police arrived, they spotted the suspect trying to evade the police by heading for Canningjoke.
But he didn't get very far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out and told the police to go in and get him", Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine reported.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to the water of the officer's uniform, so he chose a safer tactic - negotiation.
"Sometimes the escape is to resort to amusing means", said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blowing and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
The man's enterprise was doomed, but the capture inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says the reporters tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to end the competition.
Peter Moody is accusing the Racing Victoria press of a spying operation on his stable last year, a man who threatened to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims that the editors and the integrity department at Racing Victoria have personally attacked him, and that the dismissal of Lady Tata for her recent treatment on race day was the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what was best for the sport, but he has been put in a tough spot by the discovery of cobalt in a sample from Lidari, and he was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has been keeping his mouth shut on espionage charges for the last year and a half, and he didn't want the charges to be seen as the work of a bitter man.
"I didn't mean to bring it up, I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration comes out in a flash", Moody said.
"They know what really happened".
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the space after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and getting a good night's sleep.
I want to ride upright, I want the owners of the horses to believe that I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe that, I'm not gonna be able to continue as a horse trainer.
I'd have to consider my future as a licensed coach".
Moody dropped the bombshell earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he talked about the integrity department's espionage efforts at his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a job at my stable to a man who was supposed to spy on my activities, and I will tell you his name if you ask", Moody told Racing.com.
"They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they'd better come up with some evidence, because I haven't been caught doing anything illegal.
Former RVL chairman Robert Roulston, current RVL chairman David Moodie and current RVL CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the activity then and now.
Should I consider this a personal manhunt?
Should the RVL take real action and shift the responsibility for the current state of the industry to someone other than the coaches?
Am I a disgrace to the profession?
Am I really a disruption to the industry?
Perhaps many of you feel that way.
I may even get my coaching license and be pushed off my duties, and I have no doubt that my talk will make many of you feel that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm gonna push them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can retire".
The long-standing investigation of Lidar's cobalt levels and the recent rejection of the coach eventually frustrated him so much that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the trainer of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, who described the racing rules as ridiculous after a clay hoop was illegally placed on the horse's feet.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that", Moody said.
"A member of my staff mistakenly put mud on the horse's leg.
I could have done the saw last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and it was done.
But it happened on the day of the race".
Moodya can expect a three-month suspension for illegal clay handling, which the organizers have begun to unravel.
"This is a joke.
The rules were made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
Escape from the scene of the Cobra crash.
Police have arrested a man who was hit by a cyclist over the weekend, and fled the scene of the crash.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, suffering serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the man who was driving the car fled the scene and didn't stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathali reported to Shepparton Police.
He is likely to face charges for failure to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobra is still in hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is referring to the opponents' wrestling chatter.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers criticising his team's tackle play in the NRL's two league games as purposive.
According to Sydney Roosters' coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm's fight a thumbs up in a close game against the Melbourne hosts in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has been struggling to cover up the reference to the Storms defeating the Broncos in the Queensland Cowboys' grand final on Saturday night, calling the game a mock-up and noting that Queensland doesn't care much about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle play, saying they were just focusing on contact when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that two top-flight coaches criticized his team, which Bellamy sees as an indication that coaches are concerned about losing to the Storm.
"This thing always comes up, and I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything about the weight when his team beat us 24 to 2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I'll tell you, we haven't changed our defense systems or our techniques for a whole year, but for the last six weeks, we've been focusing on contact play and tackling, which has turned us up.
Trent's been on the job for three years, and losing could have been a shock to him, because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny how the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett on what is interesting about football, reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne speaks of an interesting football.
He compared his team's Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting", Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George was heavily criticized for his boring game, and Wayne said that criticism didn't bother him at all.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast centre-forward.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have an arsenal of players like this.
He made that very clear in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his way, and not every team has a center like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
It gives me a lot of confidence when other coaches are so worried about my team that they're resorting to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd be facing us in the big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more points were scored in a game between Storm and Roosters than in a game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
I've never seen that game, but what was the final score?
Our game was 20-18 and we had more chances, but is it interesting football?
Or is it the playoffs and the shortages that make football interesting?
I think it's the goals that make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably come to meet them".
The Storm have a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit either the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday at Cronulla or the Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $ 200,000 bail in a drug case .
A man facing a possible life sentence for the possession of a 40-kilogram cocaine parcel smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police seized a 100-pound cocaine shipment from the Solay, which had come via Vanuatu from South America and arrived in Coomera harbour in August.
Police monitored Maksimovic and his accomplice at the marina for the morning and surprised the two later at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where they found a 40-pound package of drugs in a parked Toyota Echo.
While Maksimovitsa may face a life sentence for possession of the drug for commercial purposes, according to his lawyer, there is no evidence that his client tried to take possession of the entire batch, but he may have been in the cafe with a harmless purpose.
According to Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to flee the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his whereabouts".
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather jointly posted bail of 200,000, against which he was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them", stated Judge Flanagan.
"It is not enough, however, to prevent the man from escaping", the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and stay home from 6 pm to 6 am.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send him pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to obtain child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged into an online message service where he got another user to send him inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she awoke, the phone was missing, and she found it in Hogg's hand asleep.
While browsing the contents of her phone, the girl found some disturbing messages and immediately told her mother.
Five of these images were reported to the police, and after searching the computers found at the address, police found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg told police he tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and impersonated police in order to scare pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the local court in Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to bullying.
He admitted to doing it on his computer, but claimed he did it to impersonate the police and to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
She said that she had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl called out to her mother, shaking and crying".
The girl saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then they interrogated Hogg.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to chat with girls who looked significantly younger than her.
Hogg, 23, of Dundee Ward Road, pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children on June 14 last year, and on January 25 this year, Hogg violated his bail conditions and failed to appear for his hearing on March 24 this year.
The defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be put on the sex offenders' register, since it can be considered that the offence did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentencing until October due to background reports from the social worker.
Mr. Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Mr. Hogg was added to the sex offender registry before the day of sentencing.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe makes a false speech in the Parliament
The oldest African head of state, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to the rostrum earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but a video of the incident quickly spread on social media.
Parliament's keynote address was also overshadowed by the allegations of opposition lawmakers that they have received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted the president's State of the Union address in Parliament with a half-hour speech, as he did on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, spokesman for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) party, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages urging them not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speeches.
"A message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside Parliament, MEPs are no longer covered by immunity.
The party's spokesman, Morgan Tsvangirai, said the party was concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and savings in the business services business.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from the faster-growing corporate hardware and services businesses.
According to HP's press release, the company will record a one-time charge of $2.7 billion for the arrangement beginning in the fourth quarter.
"The reorganisations will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's chief executive, who will lead the company after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new business model", Whitman said.
"As a company, we are better positioned than ever and better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world".
Hewlett Packard Enterprises has annual sales of over $50 billion and is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to businesses.
The company, founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is now split into two companies, the two founding an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring as it moves from traditional desktop computing to mobile devices.
The transformation of HP, the world's second largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is the latest move in a field where concentration is believed to bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: " The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dinamo Zagreb "
Wenger has also been pressing Wilshere that it's only September, and if everything goes according to his recovery plan, there's no reason why he can't be back on the field in December.
In the best-case scenario, Wilshere will be forced to miss at least the next four England games, and knowing his history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly uncertain.
The biggest problem with the last one is that Wilshere ended last season strongly after an ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blazing speed for the new season.
"An injury like this is not a career-threatening injury", Wenger said.
"The bone did not heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries".
Medically, it may be, but as Wenger pointed out, there can be additional injuries when a player tries to return to the pitch midway through the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern to be observed.
Premier Injuries Ltd. lists 23 different ailments since Wilshere made his debut six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in just 65 of a total of 157 league games over the last five seasons.
The bigger picture for Arsenal is that for six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, the team has been the second most-injured team in the league.
Wenger accepts a possible plot, but Arsenal believe the injury record improved last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes, a post-injury recovery can be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time in which to strengthen the body and seek competitive strengths", Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he can get his body back in balance, and I believe that, and that will help him continue to have the career that he deserves".
Arsenal will begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, followed by Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday, with Wenger preparing to make minor changes to the squad.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be the first ones.
Wenger may also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting line-up, replacing Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the team balanced and give rest to those who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to retain the F team, Maksimir Zagreb has some of the scariest stadiums in Europe.
The Dynamo have also been unbeaten for 41 games.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by a tremor measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This is the tenth earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's defeat at Monaco and is still motivated by the club's distant hope of winning the European Cup.
"We have a huge energy boost", said Wenger.
"This is a title Arsenal have never won.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm also a realist with experience.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers".
FriendsFest: The comedy show that taught us the truth about friendship between men
A similar description is missing in other series, and it is remarkable, especially when one considers that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK, with three times the incidence of suicide among men than among women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is tackling the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of Men, a campaign that seeks to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the very idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed, and it found that those with depression had a better chance of recovery if they were surrounded by enough healthy people.
The risk of developing the disease was also halved in asymptomatic individuals if they were in close contact with people who did not have mental health problems.
But the foundation of everything is friendship.
Today's communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content, and quick response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitization of life, the need to feel strong, fun and successful has doubled, even as isolation is a reality.
The external values associated with superficial success, money, image and social status, all of these distract from the intrinsic values and the natural desire for personal growth and friendship, and the intrinsic values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A video-game millionaire recently stated that money really cannot buy happiness.
The thing about Freddy was that the show turned the focus on the head.
Each character in the series was not defined by a profession, but by a personality, and this was reflected in their friendships.
And the show was a humorous one, with Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross missing Rachel a lot, and it was clear that the men could relate to this, even though they didn't hold back from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, it becomes clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
The men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to cope is strong, and it is easy to think of a man as weak if he talks about his problems".
"Frendit is one of those series that showcase long-term survival mechanisms.
The show emphasized the small moments of male friendship.
Through the telephone, I can offer outside help in a moment of desperation, but long-term support comes from a close circle of friends and family".
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the tapes from the series have been brought back to life, so if you're attending this weekend's event, you might want to bring your friends over for coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central is streaming the entire Frendit series  all 236 episodes  in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's shot helped PSG beat Malmo in the final
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan after scoring the winning goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedes in Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and the evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the attack as Paris Saint-Germain opened their Champions League campaign by beating Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal with less than four minutes to play in the opening game, and the French champions were immediately in the clear.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in the A-Division, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champions.
The match was not a perfect performance for the team of Laurent Blanc, who was scored by SPG, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his place and was replaced by his former home club, where he started his career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win and good performances are a good basis, even if we still have some ground to build on for the season", said Blanc.
"This is a good thing.
We had a chance to win and we did, but it's a shame we couldn't score one or two more goals".
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injury, and the team had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in his shadow at the four-minute mark.
The Argentine striker, who joined PSG from Manchester United last month, was named PSG's man to take the club to a new level in Europe, proving his worth by catching the ball from Marco Verratti's pass to Malmö's defence and then hitting a goal from behind the corner of Johan Wiland.
But those who were expecting a crushing victory for PSG were disappointed.
Malmö beat Celtic in the play-offs, marched nine international players from the start, a team with a five-man defence and two attackers, hard to beat.
Nikola Djurdjec's shot narrowly missed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back of the net in the 34th minute of the game, and the team didn't attack very actively.
The result was a disappointing second half, with the goalkeeper's goal being scored by a penalty kick from Ibrahimovic, who was then sent off for a late penalty kick.
But Ibrahimovic showed his fingers in the passing game, and on Ibrahimovic's pass, Di Maria fired a curveball past Wiland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came in the county, thanks to Cavan, the Uruguayan, playing in the sixth, shot a full-forward when Ibrahimovic threw him a shot from left-back Maxwell.
Malmö's shot ended in the second goal, and only Wiland's top shot from David Luiz's close-range shot was counted in the penalty, and Ezequiel Lavezz's goal from the bench was disallowed at the very end.
The Malmö side's goalkeeper Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played the last Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
The cuts are not enough.
A hat-trick for the Parisians.
This was their best game".
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion in an initial public offering .
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, buffeted by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion in a Wednesday stock offering as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce debt.
The company's market value has fallen 57% this year, and it's struggling with a drop in raw material prices as the Chinese economic downturn is hampering demand and putting a strain on the market.
With the stock market boom, Glencore's shares were at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share went up 2.77 per cent to 131.60p in the FTSE 100, which opened up 0.69 per cent.
Glencore announced last week plans to raise $2.5 billion in a stock offering as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold the new partners for 125p, which is a 2.4% discount to Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, which together represent up to 9,99% of the total value of the group.
Concerns about the continuing recession in China have caused the price of iron ore to collapse by half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
A White House statement released Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will make his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, following President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
After bilateral talks between the Heads of State, the President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in honour of the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to have constructive discussions on issues over which they disagree", the White House statement said.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and he is expected to drop in on Seattle to meet with several US tech leaders, and from Seattle the president would travel first to Washington and then to New York for the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concern over China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased activities in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is downplaying diversity in filmmaking.
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and said that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
On Sunday night, the veteran actor in the HBO series Project Greenlight interrupted Brown as he explained the importance of considering the different points of view on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"The diversity is taken into account in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show", Damon argued.
Brown was stunned and offended by the claim. "Wow, I get it", she said after Damon's comment that made her star in the movie "Alone on Mars".
Damon and Brown had met with fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists for the competition.
"Whoever is directing, I would like to encourage them to think about how they're portraying the character of Harmony", Brown said at the beginning.
"The only black character is a prostitute "who has sex with her white pimp".
The producers of Dear White People had endorsed Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors, to which Damon responded, in a tactful manner, that the duo's choice could lead to an unintended outcome.
When the debate was televised, social media exploded with Damon's vitriolic comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in the most direct terms: "The fact that Matt Damon is speaking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white-hating that it hurts".
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the issue of equal representation of races in the media is a hot topic.
Since the death of a teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained support across the country, seeking to end the discriminatory treatment of black people by lawmakers and law enforcement officials.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he announced the album of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"The albums still matter", he said.
"Just like books and black lives, albums still matter".
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to a question from Elisabeth Hasselbeck of Fow News about whether the group should be classified as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group based on love", the leadership of the movement stated.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear if Damon has accepted the invitation.
The first winner of the American Ninja Warrior series
Professional wrestler and collector of plate, Isaac Caldiero, won his first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday, claiming $1 million.
In the just-completed seventh season of the TV series, all the tasks given were solved for the first time.
In the season finale, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
In the final task, the men had to climb the grueling 23-meter-long rope up in 30 seconds.
The British completed the challenge in the allotted time, the first competitor to complete the fourth leg of the American Ninja Warrior Challenge, but Caldiero completed the challenge three seconds faster and emerged the winner.
Caldiero told E!News after a hard-fought battle that he was still in shock after winning the million dollar jackpot.
"The amount of money is incredible because I've never made more than $10,000 in a year", he said in an interview with E! about his winnings.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what this will be like, the future is wide open".
Co-producer Kent Weed spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten was not awarded, despite being the first contestant to complete all the missions.
"The rules say the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors complete all the tasks, the fastest will win", Weed explained.
"The prize money is a magnificent and life-changing prize, but the British also get satisfaction from their performance.
I don't think he's gonna be around to bury it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's been getting a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten is a great guy. He's a family man.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win, he'd rather see Isaac win.
She also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about her if the situation had been different".
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have squeezed a win from the Minnesota Twins .
The Detroit Tigers are not having a particularly pleasant experience in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, are now in last place in the American League Central.
But the team did manage to beat the Minnesota Twins at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins lost their chance to rise up against the Houston Astros to fight for the second wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit is back, if for one night only, to the taste of victory that has been behind the rock for the second half of the season.
"Every victory is a nice one, no matter how you get it", said Tigers shooting guard Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his composure as Detroit made three runs in the first two innings, one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings, good game, and allowed three runs.
He's only had three good starts in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the season strong this year", Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a substitute in every game, "which is why I want to pitch until the sixth inning".
Tigers pitching substitute Victor Martinez got three hits and two runs, which were his first runs batted in since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well", Ausmus said.
"He looks good in practice and kept his game going".
In the second inning of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the inning with a two-hitter with a near-left-handed shot.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks made the sacrifice kick, and Simon took over for second-string Brian Dozier, who took three straight passes before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free throw to Mauer, and rookie pitcher Miguel Sano hit a two-run home run, followed by right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the court, VerHagen got a three-way hitter named Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The Major League team took the lead for the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had scored a two-run home run in the first inning of the ninth inning, Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon hit a two-run home run to tie the game at 5-4 with the Tigers.
But the right-handed pitcher threw three straight innings and was able to hold his team's position.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes being a little rusty.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed pitcher who had just been brought back from the injured list, and he had been out for a month with a back injury.
"Of course, the start was not what I had hoped for, but as the game went on I felt more comfortable and was able to put in a decent performance and a few good passes in the third inning", Hughes said.
With Hughes in the lead, he gave a one-run double to second baseman Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
A free-throw from right-hander J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the first home run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 was broken when the team had players on the floor.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos next had one hit, one run, but Victor Martinez burned to try to advance to third.
The Tigers extended their lead in the second inning, with James McCann, the catcher, narrowly escaping a second-half penalty and Anthony Gose, the first-half penalty, to make it 3-0.
"What a shot", said Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit the right spot".
On the pitch, Hughes pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was traded to right-handed relief pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes's record is three runs, six hits, a free throw and four saves.
Note: Tigers right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not on the roster due to a hamstring injury.
The shoulder is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who amputated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list with a torn shoulder since mid-August, and he was supposed to be in by Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris will be removed from the injured list and will be in the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris has gone 1 for 1 in four games since being traded for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20th, due to a ruptured abdominal muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA: 4.43) is up against Minnesota right-hander Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA: 4.73) who is a sophomore.
Xi urges opening up the economy to the rest of the world .
"The economic system must be opened up to the rest of the world to promote growth", President Xi Jinping said at a meeting of the steering group for economic reform on Tuesday.
'China should commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and develop an economic opening-up policy', the President said at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group set up to deepen comprehensive reform.
"By promoting opening-up and deepening reforms, we will set in motion a new impetus and vitality for economic growth", Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted guidelines including a negative list on market access, the relaxation of border controls, the promotion of private capital in publicly owned enterprises and the revision of the citizens' registration system.
The communication sets out to draw up a negative list of sectors and companies in which investment is prohibited.
The system shall be tested step by step and developed through test programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, a legal business environment and the opening of the market.
The government is also reducing the scrutiny of companies, and we want to ensure that companies have a say in their own business.
The communique said that China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border areas and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The opening up of government-controlled sectors will open up many sectors to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will support the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services", the statement said.
In addition, the application for a permanent residence permit is optimised by streamlining the requirements and the application process.
The conference also dealt with the right of lawyers to practise their profession and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
