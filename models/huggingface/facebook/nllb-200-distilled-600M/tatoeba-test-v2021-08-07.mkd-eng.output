I owe Tom this.
I paid a fine.
I'm planning on skipping lunch.
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I like dogs better than cats.
I prefer goat cheese to cow's cheese.
I'm preying on a little egg.
I prefer the black.
I'd rather sit.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit a box in the fork.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I've been using the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three cups of fake sugar in your tea.
I opened my box.
I quit smoking too much.
I gave up.
I'm a farmer.
The Iranians are a peace-loving people.
I read his book.
I read a story to Tom.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be nice to keep quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize a guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
- Is anyone surprised?
Did you do anything?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw it.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister squeeze the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the washing machine.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Does Dan know what he's done?
Are the cups calorific?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see", said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston to join me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is it all there?
Are you breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I turned my head down.
I definitely should buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I have to pack.
I have to go get changed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should check.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed you my room.
Is it cold outside?
- Is that ready? - Yes.
- Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or do I think so?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
- Is that true? - Yes.
I got his beef.
I sleep on my feet.
I'm sleeping in a chair.
I slept like a hostage.
I slept in the barn.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Is Mike out of liquor?
I smiled.
Isn't that exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this a transportation?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I've been staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've been doing something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is there a word for that?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Does Tom think that's what happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is there a delivery charge?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
- Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
- Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this right?
Is it real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly in English?
Is this Jupiter or bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is that your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still don't believe you.
I still don't get it.
I don't know how to do that yet.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Can Tom swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom amused?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom mad at you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm a history teacher.
I suddenly felt old.
I have asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on seeking an exit from the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm hungry for you to come.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I was wondering.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even catch you burning and you being the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I've been talking to my counselors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It seems endless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't a no.
- It's not possible!
- That's for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I'm fine with that.
It's not going to get any better.
It doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to be helping.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's my secret.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cooling down.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her for days.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I better help him.
I think I better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm going to go out to eat.
I think I'm going to go visit Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made a pretty statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might be able to curse.
I think I'm going to be okay.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should be leaving.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
I think that's awful.
I think that's brilliant.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom is gone.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
I think Tom is soulless.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom is crazy.
I think Tom is dying.
I think Tom is funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is rude.
I think Tom is hurt.
I think Tom is mean.
I think Tom is nice.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is a little boy.
I think Tom is a squirrel.
I think Tom is rich.
I think Tom is right.
I think Tom is hot.
I think Tom is futile.
I think Tom is sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom is going to go.
I think we can catch him.
I think we'd better not drink this water.
We better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're freaking out.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you should help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should get through this yourself.
I think it's helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking of you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was me.
I thought you already had a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
So we agreed, didn't we?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you'll have to work your ass off.
So you didn't want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
So you don't hate him?
I thought he was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were inferior to you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So you said you could swim?
So you said you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played better chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so bad here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid of the bowl up.
It's a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job in a day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying for it.
It's not coming up.
They say the old chapel is the goddamn one.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a well-known passenger from his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems a little wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's going to be okay.
It's Christmas soon.
It's going to be hard to convince them.
It's going to be okay.
It's worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
You seem right.
It looks really good.
It looks different.
It seems familiar.
It looks like an egg.
I seem to have had too much to drink yesterday, I got my head shot, I'm so drunk.
Looks like these two are dating again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
You've been scolding me.
It's bothering me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a proposal, but it was an order.
He might be back tonight.
Maybe it seems weird.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it was him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have been surprised.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna be painful.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I got off.
I took the bus back.
I took Tom to lunch.
I'm out of pants.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth the wait.
It rang two days ago.
It was a big deal.
I tried to explain, but I didn't click.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to get too high.
He's about to come back.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check whether there may be any side effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you have been prescribed.
It's a child's play.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're all through.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over in a little while.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go.
It's fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already 11:00.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you wasted everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame the concrete isn't burning.
There's a quick way to get footers.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He broke it.
It's just a little candy.
It's been raining for a week, like.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's been a very warm week.
You better not talk that much.
You'd better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and lie than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees". "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna's here.
It's new money.
It scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Stay here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's reassuring.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can tell them easily.
I guess I misjudged it.
It's like her style.
It seems to me that's the only possible conclusion.
It sounds very well written.
It's empty.
That's the way you should be.
It's bad to be pissed.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's right.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's got clouds.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be wild.
It's going to get cold.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
- It's all right.
It's getting better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's her.
It's hot in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
There's no way he's getting out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in excellent condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just trying to make a point.
It's just a question of where.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's closed.
It's made of leather.
I make the decision, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to wear presents like this.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy out here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
It didn't happen that way.
It won't be easy to do without much help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
It's not scary.
It's not just a rush.
It's not usually a flash.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
- No, you don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not very often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a printing error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's only a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
That sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's a hole.
It's actually quite common.
It's really good.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really gross.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so wonderful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need any proof.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's not raining yet.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat fermented food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best yogurt I've ever tasted.
It's a spider's claw.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
He's a tough guy.
It's a shit.
It's completely wrong.
He can't handle the heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's not natural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm not a big deal.
It's windy.
It's work.
You lose.
It's your call, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes to dive into the water.
It was all night long.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and headed towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was just wonderful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great show.
This was all my idea.
It was fine here.
It was so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was a meeting.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a duty to spend the evening with a smart, spirited, beautiful girl like you.
It was a wonderful experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a hot night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a beautiful evening.
That was childish of him.
It was awful.
It was very helpful.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was her.
He was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
It was getting dark.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my mistake.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to get Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that dogs living on dogs jump higher than cats.
It was just magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
The cheap one was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
That was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day, we decided to go mountaineering.
It was so obvious.
It was a tongue.
It was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's hung on the fireplace.
Tom was.
It was a little.
It was a shame.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unremarkable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a shot.
It was your mistake.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
It's not gonna help you.
It works.
It would be perfectly normal to be angry at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I get to explain everything.
I need you right now.
I used to keep you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've read it before.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I always had someone to help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I made a cake.
I baked a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I've been around the city looking for Dom.
I was much worse.
I was betrayed.
I was notified.
I've been robbed three times a month.

We're both from Boston.
We're busy right now.
We're looking at the entire area.

We're being fooled.

We're going back.
We're very efficient.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting time.
We're dependent on work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was he one of them?
We're your neighbors.
- Was that honest?
Was he sympathetic?

Was she with someone?
We wrapped the rug.
We sat and waited.
We should ask him.
We should ask them.
We both have to go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
We should go home.
We need to help them.

We shouldn't have let her go.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
We need to set a trap.

We should have quit earlier.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon hanging out on the beach.
We started talking.
We're out of here.
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.
We understand that.
We value our customers.
None of us was right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that up.
We baked them cakes.
We're just getting started.
We're expecting her.
We were looking for them.
We've been through a lot.
They've been lying to us.

We went to the same church.
We all cheered for her.
We were all shocked.
We were both busy.
We didn't even have a broken pair.
We were pretty confused.
We were 18 at the time.

We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
They had more than us.
We were travelers.

We were very close.
Don't save the bell.
We were so worried.
We were so young back then.
We were the first to arrive.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
We're going to visit our brothers and sisters.

Didn't you know Tom was a fag?
You didn't listen to me.
