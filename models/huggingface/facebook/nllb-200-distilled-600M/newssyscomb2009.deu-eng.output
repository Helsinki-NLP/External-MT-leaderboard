The right-wing populists in Austria have won 29% of their total
A marked weakening of both parties in the previous major coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led to the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, following the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the previous chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously undermined.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the mayor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
The results show that the Social Democratic Party (SPD) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8% of the vote, but has lost 5.5% of the vote since the last election in 2006.
Even worse, the PPP lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
This is the worst result of these two major parties in the postwar history of Austria, and especially for the People's Party, which demanded the elections in the first place, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the EPP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Treaty.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the Party's executive committee on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely exit from the electoral debacle, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberal Party (FPÖ) received a provisional 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats expressed their concern that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party (then the FPÖ was still united and split from the BZÖ in 2005) had reached agreement with the populists on a joint government, which even led to sanctions by the European Union.
The Commission has already stated that it is prepared to cooperate with all parties and is planning to return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also entered Parliament, but suffered minor losses and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably overcome the four-percent barrier and therefore has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may be cooling
If the problem of the Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting bugs in India is not solved, the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, believes that some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then surely there will be a certain cooling down", he said after a meeting held on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted to cooperate with the local government in Dardjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could then ask for bail and be free to await his sentence, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same comments during the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, and then a pardon would be in question for him", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to have the accused given "competent legal assistance", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining good relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians admit that too", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reiterated to his partner, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists", he explained.
The Minister was surprised to learn that the Indian side had given him permission to deal with the matter.
"I've already been promised a lot", he merely noted.
A Czech judge over the ringing of the sea floor
It appears on an electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is part of Australia and, along with it, the adjacent seabed.
The territory is as large as the continent itself", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the UN Division of Oceans and Maritime Law's 30-person staff.
His chief, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is following the interpretation and adding to it.
There's work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed contains a world so far little known, rich in natural resources.
This is where oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials are found, but also living organisms that have not been identified to date, which are key to developing a cancer drug.
A Sea Bottom Greater Than the Continent
The countries of the region have today declared their claim to the new seabed areas.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982, is the basis for the exercise of these rights.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends into the sea up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country.
This country has an exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
'In simple terms, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its shores that is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea level.
It crosses the borders of the coastal sea, often also the 200 nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission to determine the external boundaries of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
'One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three countries have been successful", adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea area, recently received international attention.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the sea floor that the Commission approved to the country last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The future profits they will derive from the use of the seabed will be invaluable, as they promise.
More countries will also be submitting their applications gradually.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls "the common heritage of mankind".
This is a country that no longer has a special status.
The right to promote in this field is conferred on an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold-digging country", says Director Mikulka, exaggeratingly, adding that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also the property of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other former Eastern Bloc countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interocean Metal".
In 1991, the Convention granted it, as did the investors of a few other States, the status of a 'track-breaking investor'.
The organisation has the right to promote the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it's a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can grow there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian Division employee Rober Sandev brings such concrete as a pattern.
It reminds me of a little potato or, with some imagination, the fabulous scheme that brought the legend after the Golem to life.
German special forces were on the scene at the hostage release
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the Special Forces were ready, but they didn't come.
More and more details are being revealed about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the German authorities, both specialists from the German armed forces and officials from GSG 9, the German police air force, the German Crime Agency and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service were at the scene of the liberation.
But, as ministry spokesmen said on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the hostages were allowed to run and flee when they saw signs of a violent release.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to incorporate them as support forces on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian accomplices were abducted by attackers on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth across the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until recently, as were the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to Bild, the five vacationers and the special forces will be flown out on an Air Force Airbus and will arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has almost failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
The House of Representatives voted 206 to 227 to reject the government's financial market bailout.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb financial market chaos.
In a dramatic move, the proponents had tried desperately to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called for the House to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not even happened yet", he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the government's bailout package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the vote was over, and then, after the failure was announced, he fell again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The approval of both the House and the Senate is required for the programme to enter into force.
Organisers are seeing increasing bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months have seen a significant increase in sales compared to the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, according to one study, the German travel will remain unchanged.
The German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin that the rice offices recorded a 31% increase in sales for the winter season compared to the previous year.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased bookings for the autumn months.
The DRV reported that the sales surplus of travel agents for October was around 11% compared to 2007.
The results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data for 1200 German travel agents and calculates them for the overall market.
The bookings made up to the end of August 2008 are included.
The DRV reported that the weak dollar exchange rate was particularly in demand for travel to the USA.
This is a third of the increase in bookings.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the German countryside, are particularly sought after destinations.
In particular, package travel was high on the agenda, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs here are 'better calculated for the customer than for a holiday organised individually'.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of electronic cigarettes and tobacco products is therefore not intended to be a basis for the adoption of a directive on the protection of consumers.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans travelling decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballerman-Apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter barrels and celebrities in designer dirndln.
It's the Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, TV host, and wears a custom-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers are already running down on us and cramming the memory cards - very flattering, on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to be doing its job.
As Wiesn-Touri, and actually north of the White-Worst Equator, the feeling of well-being in the dress has remained limited until now.
But once we get to the Theresien weed, everything's half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all perfectly normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndl shorts.
A woman in Munich points out that I had tied the apron wrong: "Left coughs free, middle virgin, right forgiving, back widowed".
I'm sneaking the loop from the back to the left.
"Fit", he said, laughing.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques, wearing simple fillet hats that read "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretching the naked back of an uninvited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, from England, and is also attending the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
He tells me that after he's gotten rid of his previous drinking habit.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious wildbies.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics march in crowds across the plaza to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses are always in a pack - four at a time, dragging a covered carrier from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
Whoever's in the Promille drawer under the plane, you can't see.
"They're the ones who never go to the bathroom", one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in a nutshell.
Name of accident victim notified by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been released.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of driving under the influence.
He's been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's interior.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding on the end of the railway ladder with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to fall apart.
But once you're inside the vaulted ticket counter, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernest access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, a late bloomer in the imperialist game, had to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans were crippled during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, a train of ammunition flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling apart, largely out of the picture.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all of its eastern regions, to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions created by the borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key facts of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to Ankara, Turkey, to visit one of the leading experts on foreign policy of the AKP, the Turkish Member of Parliament Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on the tracks that produced the ancient world's equivalency in the famous documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city for the new secular state project to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
The AKP, however, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially designed, state-of-the-art stone and steel building in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to close the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the Party's foreign policy is now to integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception", he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There's no one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point", I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey", he said, "did not want to have to face this decision".
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I spoke to here has said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that Europe as a whole can, in a broad sense, travel eastwards on the same railways as Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha railway station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr. Knight and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, for the most part, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the docks for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at the time, there seemed little doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (call on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was designed for youths up to the age of 21, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were in our late 20's - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir, any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and was solely due to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which never waned over the years.
How often did death stop us from "leting the music speak for itself"?
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His conducting style was absolutely clear and precise, never dominating, but never exaggerating.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded something even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I've written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by one - often I've been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal humility.
He hated conductors who, he said, simply "went around the world with one or two famous show pets".
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your letter of inquiry to William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research fellowship in 1950 ... while simultaneously studying for a BSc, MA and PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Behind the Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino Flamenco and Life because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are fantastic.
They made me notice them because of their simplicity and the power they exude, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this large-scale limousine offers a much larger interior.
In addition, the technical details make driving even more comfortable and fuel savings possible.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the emphasis will be on innovative design, new flexibility in space, larger dimensions of the car and new mechanics.
However, before we start analyzing the new model, we must say that this new jazz comes out six years after the first generation was introduced.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew this model for a shorter period of time compared to other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also in 2008.
After the Jazz market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while a Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the estimates are expected to be 10 000 cars, representing 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models a year.
More specifically, the introduction of the new Honda Jazz model will help to cover the sales decline in Spain.
In fact, the brand's leaders hope to close the year with total sales of 22,000, down 4,000 cars from 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain from the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is focusing on the emergence of a new model.
It's Insight, a 5-door, compact, 4.7-meter-long hybrid car that Japanese companies hope to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The market launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, with its first public presentation in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimetres), and the distance between the axes is 2.50 metres, which leads to the assumption that it has grown by 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, remains unchanged and remains 1.52 meters.
As the dimensions increase, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in the previous jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double-charging system, also reaches up to 339 litres, which is 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be emphasised that these measures are present in the 1.4 litre petrol engine version, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz's 1.2-litre petrol engine trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements, other than the addition of additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, include improved access to seating.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, whereas the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are new too.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has two versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, with excellent technical performance while providing high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2 litre variant produces 90 hp at 6 000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min.
This petrol engine - the previous Jazz model reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
In terms of the front engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 litres of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-bee', which avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot that relies on the swarm behavior of bees to avoid accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the Nissan four-layer safety shield.
This robot is supposed to make sure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important feature is the bee's faceted eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, allowing it to fly uninterrupted in its personal airspace.
To replicate the round-the-clock perspective, the engineers developed what they called the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two metres away from the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that is immediately translated into a collision avoidance signal
`The moment an obstacle is detected, the little robot will mimic the flight of the bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at an angle of 90o or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other system is that this maneuver of evasion is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot would not be able to react at sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither move up or down, nor overhead; it can only move in two dimensions and in a direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and infinite ways, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to help the small robot avoid collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on it.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed to be stored, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs or even the MBs of the storage.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for immediate collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced to production cars in the next decade.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible use of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system via satellite to guide you to your destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She's shaking before she's hit with a mortgage.
It must be understood that the US Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid US citizens getting caught up in mortgage stories of supposedly eligible banks, a fun and informative game for internet surfers was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the hotel's bad credit, the hotel's bad credit, or the restaurant's bad credit.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times whether it is time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
I'm sure she has some useful information, but no details.
It's more of a teenage page than a place for all the viewers.
What happens when the game expands?
Well, if a dream room appears at the hotel.
At least a little, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley is making its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, a change due to a sharp drop in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a flat price of $25.25, bringing the total to $3 billion.
The price accepted is below 19% of the share price as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in convertible shares that will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29 or 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley shares fell 6.79% to $23.07 at 5pm GMT.
`This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to holding bank status', explained John Mack, Managing Director of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley took this status last week, which is supposed to allow it to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms of the deal, which were announced on Monday, also show that the deal has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
`One week ago,' explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, in Tokyo, `we thought the stake would be entirely of common stock.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and protect ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below the exchange rate for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go off with a profit reduction of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares within one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% of the sales value, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to exploit investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to give details of the strategic plans of the two new allies.
The investment by MUFG should enable Morgan Stanley to register a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had significantly reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has had to watch its stock price fall by half as the price of insolvency insurance has skyrocketed.
This price fell on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republics are being re-established around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
The third was the one who, following the example of his peers and friends, voted this Sunday on the plan for a new constitution.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights is being implemented.
The results showed that 28% voted no, 7% voted invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling stations and a countdown by a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for `Yes', with 63% to 70% predicting it.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he said in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, and congratulated Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was praised by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in secret under the Organization of American States (OAS) observation clause, was based on a 444-point text on the protection of the new socialism, which the President is advocating.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by leaving it with the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that is largely dependent on oil production by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange that migrants send to the country.
The project, which is being led by the 2006 elected Correa, also gives the head of state more power, which will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years and will have the option of dissolving the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will exercise this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched an attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for 11 days, were returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
The next day they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
The hostages, apparently in good condition, arrived on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base near Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m.
They were immediately taken to the hospital in Maadi, a foreign neighborhood in Cairo, on a helicopter without being able to speak to the press.
They are all in good health and the kidnappers have not been paid a ransom,' said Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After being captured on September 19 at a land vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages were repeatedly brought from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The tourists are eleven - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organisers of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night just before dawn.
`Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomatic staff, Franco Frattini, reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
`We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces men', he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a field vehicle in a patrol that contained the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the Chad leader, and arresting two.
The army declared that it was linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, but immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
That's all right.
But a part of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and condemn the miserable sums paid to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or to the national historic sites that are starving to death?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros exclusively for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loiret Valley?
Our American neighbors have a constitution that says that protecting cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of Congress and all government districts, by mutual consent.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 historical societies are working to investigate history, save the numerous private archives and preserve the archaeological remains with a few pennies.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers drop their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalization of parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are trying to take over the Fortis Bank, a Belgian-Dutch bank that has been in turmoil since the US financial crisis, by means of a partial nationalization.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations over the weekend with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions now taken in relation to the bank could be of a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states are buying the respective shares of the bank at about 49%.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, in particular the insurance activities purchased by ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year.
Fortis shares began a steep valley trip last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for bankruptcy.
The institution's securities fell 12 percent to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of current share prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the Management Board.
The management believes that the $700 billion American bailout package and the resulting market uncertainty are the culprit in the Fortis stock fallout.
On Monday, however, the rates rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest in a substantive offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to reassure the public - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, no panic has broken out among the customers, no storms have taken place at the bank's branches.
In Hungary Fortis has independent branches, but also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of the medicinal data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, or else we'll give the fox the chickens", Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription tracking program, quotes the Washington Post.
Insurance establishes the fees and amounts to be paid in the event of damage depending on the health of the customer and, should the risk be overestimated, the insurance is not completed.
In the past, the client was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: using the customer's ID number, he gets the last one and a half years of pharmacy data, which is, what drugs were purchased, and the program calculates the patient's illness and health status.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it would suggest that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically put him in a higher-risk group.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurers only have to handle the paperwork more, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, like migraines and heat waves, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurers' point of view, while the ones mentioned above are not.
For the purposes of data collection and processing, companies have been set up that ask the patient for their consent before they obtain the data.
They must now do so by law, although there have been no penalties for omissions.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with the data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time, controlling their use is becoming more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare and insurance service providers.
The bill has already been introduced to Congress, which would allow the authorities to control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his programme so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject can hardly deny access to his data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise enter into a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the fox's mercy.
The global food plan from Marseille
The European Union and India double their trade
With the European Union and India as leading trading partners, this was the main theme of the ninth summit, alongside other global issues.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic superpower that should be given more votes and a voice on international issues, but the member states have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not even an ambitious target.
In this respect, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally consolidated into one agreement, thus enabling future aviation to be flown as well.
India wishes to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
The Commission has also been urged to convene a UN conference on the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to condemn terrorism as the most serious of all.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides blaming the failure.
The EU stressed that it is adhering to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as did the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the next climate summit, to cut greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the implementation of the programme.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, there are hopes of EUR 20 billion worth of contracts from French firms for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th book fair, the most important international event for copyright acquisition.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, who will be distributed over the fair's 171,790 square metres and present over 403,000 titles.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264-square-metre exhibition space Punto Italia'.
A press conference will be held in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair, near the Room Structure, to discuss figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy.
The data show that the importance of books by foreign writers is declining overall, but particularly in the adult and youth sectors.
The tiny plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, found missing a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The individual pieces were found on a 3,000-meter high plateau in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson fully cleared the last of the doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a force has been deployed, and we now have the certainty that it was the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared".
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transportation Safety Board (TSB) reported that a team was dispatched to identify the aircraft just hours after the sighting of the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007 after Fossett took off on a three-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Last night, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found near her Mammoth Lakes home in California, near the Nevada border.
These are two ID cards named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long string of records.
In 2002, he made his sixth attempt, becoming the first man to orbit the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without an interim landing with an airplane.
Among his records is a flight over the Andes at an altitude of 1544 m, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you didn't expect
A Suv that is out of the ordinary patterns because of its original design and special linearity, loading surface and clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this off-road vehicle.
The Suv Glk will be unconventional, especially because of its exceptional characteristics, and will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
The advertising campaign that will accompany the new model will also be presented in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign.
A project with a maximum amount of effort, which will take place in various phases, covering the central shopping area of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is depicted.
Then, using the Elumina8 technology, the new GLC is illuminated at different times in all its details to put it back together as a whole.
The aim of Mercedes is undoubtedly to introduce a new type of advertising to this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers?
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
They're coming from Triveneto. Now they're risking a stadium ban.
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently has not caused any serious problems.
I've never had a fight with a fan.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, these were joined by other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They wear the Tricolori, which shows the militants' cities, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan, that of Levski.
Figc had provided 144 cards for the game to Italian fans, all of which were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: none of the people who travelled to Sofia had a stadium ban.
Four Italian fans who were already in this situation were also denied a ticket and a trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for reports from the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified in the riots can expect a minimum of five years' ban on the stadium.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank you.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycat killers who might follow him a little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and this does not give any justification for such conduct", the Viminal says.
"Therefore, especially with regard to the national team's game on Wednesday in Lecce".
Because in fact, there is a small nucleus of Italian ultrasound in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Authority) will meet, and on Tuesday the Casms, who can count on a part of the Aise, the intelligence service that deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-duce shouting and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the view of Domenico Mazzilli (pronounced clearly in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, where now a core of supporters of the 2002 foundation of Ultras Italia comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but there is no doubt that the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist  adds the number 1 of the observatory  crimes are punished in the country of their action.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used to finance the implementation of the programme.
But we also talk about the whistles during the hymn Mamelis: this too, although not a crime, but allow me, there is no education... "
