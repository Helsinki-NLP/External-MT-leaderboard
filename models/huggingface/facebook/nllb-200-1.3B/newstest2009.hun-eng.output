The Prague Stock Exchange went down at the end of the trading day.
The Prague Stock Exchange has corrected its losses after the morning crash.
The shares of the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) were traded at almost half the normal daily trading volume.
The Prague stock market immediately resumed its fall on Monday, when it fell by almost six percent since the start of trading on Tuesday.
This time, the fall in Wall Street stocks is behind the decline.
This is also the market reaction to the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
Shares falling in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day eventually erased some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index recorded a decrease of almost 4% during the trading period, but later cancelled some of the losses and reduced the decrease to around 2,5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5 percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market is down 3.6 percent according to the Taiwan index.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect global financial markets", noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are on par with those of the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that the US legislature should immediately resume negotiations and pass the financial system support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries are at risk of being affected.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system that would have cost $700 billion.
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the bill would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indexes recorded their biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, the last time it had experienced a similar drop in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the House had rejected the proposal, the index started to free up.
Congress backed down, allowing the U.S. government to pump $700 billion into the banks.
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
They're voting on this early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have reached a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
But there's no victory yet.
Congress must finalize some details of the agreement before they can release the final form of the law and vote.
The draft financial aid bill is being debated in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee.
According to Senate sources, the bill is likely to be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
Economists say there should be an announcement that the bailout plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the revival of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there is a 'scramble' afterwards.
The plan must be effective.
"We have made a great step.
We've resolved our differences about what the shape of the market stabilization package should be", Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He thinks the final vote could be on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, on Saturday night to finalize the government fund.
It would have to buy up from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets which are causing financial companies to incur serious losses and jeopardising the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to a final agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market.
The improvement plan still needs to be continued, but I think we're there", said Paulson.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are now seeking a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before trading begins on Asian financial markets, where the congressional decision could be the first to affect Monday's trading due to the time zone.
It is not clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the trial could be delayed at the last minute due to some problem.
The legislators are hoping to get the bill passed in the next few days.
However, the law is still going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to support the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President George Bush, the first 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible.
But Congress can block the remaining amount, which is set at an additional $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations
While the president can veto this resolution, Congress can override his veto.
But despite these changes, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire assets to buy bad mortgage securities that were losing value because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgage loans.
"We worked it all out.
The bill should be able to be voted on by the House on Sunday and by the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of bus compensation
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the benefits, and timing the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called busing compensation of the directors participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard on this and we've made great strides toward an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who are having trouble paying their mortgage.
The government should pay new installments on the mortgages it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly installments of the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Spiritual Help
The proposed plan, David Marek, chief economist of Patria Finance, says it's a good idea, but it's going to be very difficult to implement.
"This is because you cannot know how the troubled assets will be bought and at what price.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will share losses between each other", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Marek doesn't think it's important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
"It is more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give its blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of agreeing to the plan being approved is the most important thing at this moment", Marek stressed.
A few fights: MP3 players versus cell phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost all cell phones can play MP3 files, you can't use any MP3 player to make a phone call.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
You're probably having a hard time getting a high-end, expensive record player at home to play the latest Maxim Turbulence record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bakelite records, but there is no objective reason for this from a quality point of view.
But if you have a record store full of art rock, jazz, or blues, you probably dream of a record player like this.
It's similar to traveling, which is compressed - simplified to MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here too.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend eight thousand kroner for a record player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a 20-kr market-priced headset.
Two extremes, with enough room for everyone.
There's a lot to choose from.
The life of the batteries also matters
Some of the best music players are capable of doing more than just playing music, but also something that most mobile phones don't even have the chance to do.
No other device today is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the basic functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a camera for both right and wrong, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, he's got a little computer in his pocket.
It's a miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television can take pictures.
Multi-functional phones have their drawbacks.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more times the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-consumers.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than 10 or 12 hours, but most of them are much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
So, with cheap cell phones, you can expect them to be off your phone for a few hours.
If you are also on the phone, get a charger at work for safety reasons - even for more expensive devices.
MP3 players won't have that problem, and even the worst ones can handle at least nine hours of continuous playback on a single charge.
The next problem is when you're uploading music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod) the players don't need any special software.
You just need to load the device with music from the computer via USB.
Most mobile phones and players already have their own music library, sorted by performer, album, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only represent a string structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (i.e. iver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a particular device, consider the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and of course the comfort of handling.
If music is your primary background and you only listen to it for a short time each day, such as on the subway, any MP3 player phone is fine.
And that's what any phone can do.
You don't have to pay much attention to what music formats your phone or player can play.
They all deal with MP3s, and the vast majority of the music that you get is in that format.
MP3 is one of the most common and besides it the vast majority of devices also deal with music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and for its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also enable online music purchases, for example.
All you have to do is visit the relevant website of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service alone can be a compelling argument for buying music on mobile.
Unfortunately, the service providers are a bit short-sighted and usually limited to one-year radio camps.
The prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this particular way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he puts his phone in his pocket while his forgotten MP3 player lies at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which is available on almost all mobile phones, but only a few MP3 players have it.
For many, the biggest advantage of mobile music is probably the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
But more often than not, you're limited by the lack of output from a conventional earphone.
The best and most technically equipped phones with conventional 3.5 mm diameter holes in the headphones can cost up to 15,000 kroner.
The advantage of the players, however, is that they are easy to use.
Everyone can handle the simplest - not necessarily the cheapest - players (see our selection).
Minimal function, the previously standard tape recorder and gramophone-like handling is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of accidentally switched on mobile internet and the huge bill for data transmission that follows.
What to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an opening for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
The maximum amount is 2,000 kroner, even if you buy the right card.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can afford an 8GB memory card.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowboy, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgetton or Envy.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than SEK 1100.
If you are a more demanding student, you may prefer to use a special mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, making the control convenient to the MP3 player.
The industry's most advanced player is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series of mobile phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands can provide the same service at the same price category up to SEK 4000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will be in the Czech Republic later this year.
Maybe I should.
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our operators offer virtually the same services as their Western European counterparts.
However, we are missing something here - a virtual service provider that forces the traditional providers to significantly reduce their prices.
Maybe it won't be that long.
We've written on Mobil.cz many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the Czech authorities, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
The latest move by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges may lead to a contradictory situation: some customers of Czech mobile operators will have cheaper SMS messages from abroad than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition to really fight.
Now, this may sound counterintuitive, because we have three cellular networks and we're at a very high penetration of over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed with Pavel Dvořák, the chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Board, who has stated several times before that there is no place for a new operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its own network probably has little chance (and therefore probably has difficulty finding frequencies).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant price reduction, to which the traditional operators have had to respond.
Meanwhile, even before big names like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile came on the market, voices like ours were heard in Britain.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
Nevertheless, we don't have to go too far to give an example.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking, a virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than six months, the operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual service providers is that they can focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally appear to be low-cost - offering cheap calls and text messages, which are often offset by less service.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers text messages at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as Mobilking in Poland shows, it's a pretty good bet on a target audience.
This is a service that specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - a service they like, one they can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether a similar idea in Poland will work here.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it was relatively satisfactory in terms of the provision of services.'
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators claim that
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem very promising.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region", said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
By implication, it showed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic were not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they will do their utmost to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has been keen to launch the virtual service for some time now, and it intends to take another step forward in order to make Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the corporate customer space.
"We are very interested in providing our customers with not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
This possibility has been discussed repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in negotiations", says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information suggests we may have a chance to get the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
But for now, his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
'At the moment we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider has a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by a single entity offering complex and serious projects in this area", Vlastimil Sršeň, from the press department of Telefónica 02, told Mobil.cz.
The special situation of the Czech market is also cited by other operators.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, agrees with O2 in an exceptional way and adds: 'We have not yet registered any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.'
And he added, "T-Mobile's network is unlikely to have any virtual service providers until the end of the year.
A concrete agreement should be on the table at this moment to be able to think in such a short time".
Vodafone is focusing on meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
From the customer's point of view, we find that to be the most rewarding.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find partners to build shared networks for high-speed mobile internet.'
Responsible agencies - on a level playing field with service providers
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, and the entry of a new operator would increase competition, lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why facilitate such competition?
When the service providers are able to collaborate on something important, the story of the birth of U:fon is also witnessed.
The biggest pressure on the CTU was probably the birth of the U:fonte of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the CTU website.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument for why we shouldn't allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been affected by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and its services will place high demands on it.'
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, the complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is quite astonishing.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition.
The Competition Authority is the sole authority.
But the Bureau has a very specific approach to the whole problem.
'The entry of a virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contracts have been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently attractive to traditional operators,' said Kristián Chlapua, from the Competition Office's external relations department.
A statement from the representatives of the service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
But this is more than strange from an agency which should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses its market position.
Alternatively, adds Kristián Chalupa: "Outside the EU, where virtual service providers are commonly active, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decrease in the price of mobile phone services".
However, it is likely that pressure to maintain the proper functioning of the market environment and to reduce prices is not in the interests of ÚOHS.
The case is truly shocking, and the response of the three mobile operators is quite touching.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Like gas stations, the exact same gas prices are probably just the result of chance and fierce competition.
'The Office has not detected any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither of the operators has a leading position, i.e. no proportionate responsibility for its market activities.
The telecoms regulator is also likely to lack the tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers,' Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership position is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, which shows that telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, there is of course no Czech operator in a leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the establishment of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain segment it's necessarily dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum for the NRA to believe that three mobile operators behave in a remarkably similar way.
Meanwhile, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all the operators.
The transfer of responsibility to the CCP is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, which takes the ÚOHS off the case.
We've seen this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act did not allow the extension of the competence of ČTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the U.N. Security Council must know this, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one's watching.
Meanwhile, the operation of some virtual service providers, of which there are already many operating on Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, which are only partially public.
Because these are multi-level marketing companies.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
These companies' price lists usually only get to the chosen few.
The magic is that the company is acting against the service provider like a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a preferred customer, it will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-emption.
'If there were cases of which you are talking, it could be a breach of contract that we would deal with and which could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company in question,' answered Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem.
But it's unlikely that news of such activity would not have reached the people in charge of the mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may have thousands of customers.
Meanwhile, no provider is defending itself against such a procedure.
These companies have a significant profit from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of the potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, yet only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not in their name and therefore they cannot have it fully as a general customer of mobile operators.'
But that's what the CTU should be curious about.
In addition, another question arises for the OHIM.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to this kind of procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual carrier?
It should be added that the OHIM has a relatively strong legal capacity to detect such activity and, if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation by the service providers that they did not suspect such activity and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers have been established, traditional service providers have more or less tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were essentially the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries, it was at this very moment that regulators intervened, not to protect the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
And then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they got the first virtual service provider to follow.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are handing the whole thing over to each other.
In our experience, we cannot shake the impression that they are well-suited to having ambiguous competences in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is indeed coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If one of the providers were to allow the creation of a virtual mobile service, it would be difficult for the OHIM to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be more expensive to call.
There are four new versions of the new Czech anthem.
Choose the Best
Listen to four takes of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Where is my country?" on the occasion of the Czech Republic's National Day.
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female soloists, with vocal arm or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The modification of the hymn was written by Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the website iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has previously told that it has deliberately selected young singers with representative voices, expressive and popular, to sing solo variations.
"From the very beginning, I tried to be clear in my diction, clear in my lyrics, and harmonious in my work with both of them and later with the orchestra", he said.
The Czech national anthem is celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
Where is my homeland? was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's Tyl Fidlovačka, with music by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "New" Anthem?
Prague Transportation Company will deliver for the first time on Wednesday with a chip card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in Prague Transport Company history as the date when the first passenger to board the subways, trams and buses will have an electronic ticket in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to approximately 100,000 Opencard chip card holders.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time deposit it on their chip card at the information centres and booking offices of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Since yesterday, coupons can also be purchased online through the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet for business can forget about the ticket offices in the metro, where they have regularly had to wait in long lines for tickets.
The voucher can be purchased online and the Opencard card can be purchased at one of the thirteen counters of the City Library.
"These places offer passengers a desk with trained waiters who help them shop online and save their purchased vouchers on their card", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, e-vouchers for Opencard will also be available in the self-service machines in some lobbies.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket officers, and passengers may have already noticed them at the Rozyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty", added Opatrný.
The coupon is checked by an automaton instead of the driver
Operating the automata that start tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will automatically be forfeited.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, which mainly travel to the capital by residents of the Central Czech routes.
"On the Prague integrated trains, the drivers were provided with card readers, which also help to determine the zone validity of the coupons", explained Filip Drápal of Ropid, the organisation that compiles the Prague public transport timetable.
On buses around town, card readers are installed at the driver's desk and the cash register.
The driver must therefore not only show the chip card when boarding but also place the Opencard in a specified place on the side of the cash register.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, for example, the easiest way is to ask the driver", Drápal added.
Passengers who travel on non-city buses and do not remember when their coupons expire can go back to the vending machines that save coupons on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Swedes wanted a referendum on the United States.
The Sudeten Germans demanded the annexation of Šumava to the United States in 1945.
This is according to the letter in the collection of the South Czech Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 a group of Sudeten Germans approached the President of the United States with this request.
This is also revealed by a letter from a private archive, now kept in the South Czech Scientific Library.
The Czechs in Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava County" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler had seized under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure in the words that the American troops are not coming to German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter reads, signed "People who bear the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since annexation of Czechoslovakia would supposedly give the Sudeten Germans - despite their knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this territory would be considered a foreign country, which oppresses and exploits the minority and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies", the letter states.
The reason why the authors could not sign was supposedly fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So if the president of the United States supposedly doubted the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in Shumava County on whether its people want to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a bit naive in the light of modern knowledge of postwar history, some historians believe it adequately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czechs had the slightest idea that they would be evicted, few of them recognized the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to grant the Sudetenland a kind of autonomy.
Still others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and sent him to the Holštynsk concentration camp, dozens of other Czechs came to him to teach them Czech.
"They were confident that when they returned home, they would be able to speak the Czech language", said Chalupa.
He said that none of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported under the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The emotional campaign is attacking the leaders
The most expensive road safety operation in Czech history.
This is the description of the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be on television, radio, in theaters, on the Internet, and in the flyers.
You should warn drivers about speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
It is aimed at the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what do they show in the commercials?
Emotional stories, mostly human stories.
This is also reflected in the campaign's "bloody" slogan:
You don't think - you pay!
"Don't think" is in capital letters on the license plate.
And the bloodstain says "you'll pay".
This should signify that a person may pay with his life for a moment's inattention.
The viewers are "terrified" by the commercials until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where dramatic images of accident victims are regularly shown.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The commercials were produced by Euro RSCG.
Pull it, let it go for the drivers
"Drivers are subject to a 'pull and drop' system.
The 'get it' for them is when they go through the red light, for example, saving time.
The 'pull' is the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need a press campaign, especially a negative one, the psychologist argues.
He thinks warning signs are less effective than warning signs.
"If a warning sign is fitted, it is likely to become absorbed in the environment and not be addressed by drivers", warned Kořán.
Olmert would give back almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the Israeli interim government, spoke of returning virtually all the territory occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published Monday by the Jedi daily Achron.
"We have to make a deal with the Palestinians, which means we have to give back almost all, if not all, the (occupied) territories", Olmert told the daily.
"We keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He acknowledged that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and who wants to prevent tractors and bulldozers from crossing over them, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to the July attacks on two cities that killed some people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the "Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" in the Old City.
"Anyone who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work", he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they have to give up to get the Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they must give up the regular support they provide to Hamas, al-Qaeda and jihadist terrorism in Iraq,' the Prime Minister said.
Is it illegal to have escorts on buses?
The law doesn't know them, you can't ride long-distance buses
The tragic bus accident involving the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, raised the question of whether the bus would allow passengers and crew to travel on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the escort is in contradiction with the law on transport activity", says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old passenger last week was probably caused by the driver of a truck crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for her, she was sitting next to the driver in the least safe seat on the bus at the time, although two other seats were available for her.
The bus may crash or brake suddenly even while the attendant is serving coffee or offering a newspaper.
It is important whether the bus has a parking space according to the traffic licence.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency's buses do not have any stops; this was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura, the company's director.
"We tried to find a solution with this ministry, and at first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this was withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can use the toilet during the journey, provided they have their own seat,' he said.
The law doesn't know the passenger
'There is no clear legal framework for the role of escort - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The road traffic law only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define his rights and obligations,' adds Hanzelka's spokesman, less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space on the licence.
And that's it", he says.
Buses can be, by their nature, urban buses with stops and limited maximum speed, and intercity buses with stops and allowed higher speeds, and distance buses without stops and allowed maximum speed, with seatbelts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP's transport safety expert, does not see any fundamental problem with the movement of the passengers on board the bus.
"There is little danger in continuous progress, as in the case of a service on an airplane.
"You're not sure when there's turbulence and the flight attendant might hit his head".
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like city buses and trams.
The safety of passengers must be addressed by the carrier's internal rules", he says, and also believes that the problem is not solved from a legal point of view.
Jančura is ready to shut down services
Student Agency is the only bus operator offering escort services.
It employs 200 escorts.
The director doesn't consider their occupation risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of escort is risky, I'll stop it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
It would also be a cost-saving measure", he says.
The absence of escorts in his vehicles was justified by security concerns by Alexei Litvin, the director of Asiana, which operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We have no escorts, we've been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal injury", he told Týden.cz just over a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy.
A young Plesne passenger who had been working for the company for two years died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the lane without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus.
The bus driver suddenly maneuvered to avoid, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jančura denies that two reserved seats for the rest of the passengers were also sold.
"These seats on long-haul flights are not reserved, they're blocked".
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
In compensating the girl's family, the agency is not waiting for the court's verdict, but is also expecting financial compensation from the perpetrator.
Amendment of the law?
In the distant future
The amendment to the law, which has been under consideration for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"However, the group did not reach any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the points system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the escorts as something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of the passengers", Hanzelka's spokesman concludes, saying that the police and the labour offices are responsible for checking the safety of buses.
The hopes of Dusseldorf are in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB management to the bank's employees is not short of big words.
The merger of the divisions of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Frankfurt Deka-Bank could create a 'central capital market organisation for the savings finance group', says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB will bring a permanently profitable 'competence block' into such a business.
Such a link could provide a decisive impetus for further mergers in the regional banking sector.
That's the reading of a board of directors trying to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertain situation of WestLB continues to be under immense pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalian provincial government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution was short.
However, for savings customers, the relationship between Deka-Bank, which is renowned for its investment funds, and WestLB has been a long-standing topic, including in Frankfurt.
At the end of August, when presenting the half-yearly data, Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, said that he did not see the need to merge the Mainzer Landstraße bank with a regional bank such as Helaba or WestLB.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is composed half of representatives of regional banks and half of representatives of savings banks, has entrusted the Board of Directors with the task of negotiating with WestLB on joint business.
This may involve a capital market transaction or parts thereof.
However, financial sources say that the negotiations have only just begun.
The name Deka-Bank, which is one of the main employers in the Frankfurt financial sector with its 3000 employees, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka-Bank would merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But this triune alliance was nothing.
The plans were not made public until the Hessen provincial government objected to Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks didn't find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a link between Deka-Bank and the regional banks has been repeatedly raised.
However, most recently Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, has spoken out against the plans to merge with the bank.
Nevertheless, it is worth recognising the need to bring the different public sector banks closer together.
The Commission notes that the Bank's shareholders are not the same as the shareholders of the Bank.
That's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to merge further increases, it may run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, it could only be a junior partner, although it has so far been much more affected by the financial crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds 85% of the shares in Helaba, at the beginning of the year.
If you don't, NordLB will stay.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of individual banks fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings and Loan Association had not yet given an answer to the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future of the regional banks.
Finally, a split-up of WestLB is conceivable, but this is not what is naturally desired there.
Thus, the letter from the local administration says that they are definitely working toward a "complete solution".
How this fits in with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank is the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But now Elena is here as his girlfriend, and everything is different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to a five-litre Kaiser barrel, a bearded man with a strong build demonstrates to the 200 or so people traveling to Oktoberfest how deep the sounds he makes come out of his throat.
Elena first makes up Luca's face, then she kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 11:45 p.m. for "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arriving at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, the fourth for Brazilians only.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans were already singing alongside their flags, and the celebration began during the night.
And so loudly that it's not for Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a long fur coat and wide silver-rimmed glasses.
He's been to Oktoberfest five years, and he's organized three trips this year.
There at night, at the Oktoberfest in the middle of the day, home at 10:30.
Marco says that accommodations would be an unnecessary expense.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes Kaiser, a welcome beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Law, accident insurance and a German language tour - Marco took a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already jumping into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
That's fine, they'll need their strength.
They will stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the motorway 8 several Italian buses will also make a short stop before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven, as planned, there are already nearly 50 other buses arriving from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding one last briefing, explaining the battle plan.
First, everyone put on the yellow caps.
On the left side of this one, in broken letters, is written "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the beer hall doors open, run", Marco shouts into the morning.
Running and taking up positions in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, or we'll get stuck, and not all the yellow hats sitting at the same benches, but spread out in the tent!"
"A pint costs eight and a half euros", Marco shouts.
And not to forget the tip.
"Show the security guards you're well behaved.
As you leave your seats, they are taken".
Third, be back here tonight at exactly half past eleven. Do you understand?
And now we're heading for Wiesn.
Along the way, one man ties yellow hats to the trees, signs, and even the election placards of one of Bavaria's major nationalist parties.
We must prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; there are speculations of 50,000 people crossing the Alps and entering the breweries, with 10 percent of all weekend visitors reportedly coming from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police, and Italian volunteers are helping the Bavarian Red Cross, which has the highest national statistics of about 200 medical care cases, ahead of the Austrians (about 80), and the British, who are at the bottom of the list (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer was especially popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for the lenders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and even included in his remarks that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Daxon listed Munich real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies amounted to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only pays interest on the portion that's used.
The money comes in part from private, part from public banks.
In the background, the losses of the subsidiary of Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state-financed Depfa loaned money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for these projects for extremely short terms - which is no longer possible due to the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio decreased moderately, from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net cash receipts decreased to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while receipts from credit claims and defined-interest securities and the liquidation of the loan business decreased by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-post settlement costs of the transformation of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of the interest on the taxable income and the business made to the companies in the group, led to a relatively moderate revenue deficit of 16%.
The former state financier, after the privatisation in 1990, first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later spun off in Aeral Bank.
Since traditional state financing was not profitable, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in public-private partnerships (PPPs) and expanded its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries is now to be described by Hypo Real Estate in a way that has a 'substantial impact' on the group's earnings performance, as stated rather generally.
The fact is, no dividend payments have been made.
The dividend was reduced to one third in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has stalled as banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets per year to refinance part of Depfa's loan portfolio, which amounts to some EUR 50 billion.
Hypo Real Estate stated that the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for a reasonable period of time and the company is protected 'from the influence of the international financial markets which are currently largely non-functional'.
Other sources claim that the money ensures refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of HRE, however, stated that Hypo Real Estate would not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable period.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secured.
This gives the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But because of the dynamics and the immensity of the crisis, some people can't be in it.
It is also inconceivable that the financing should not be fully utilised.
But the opposite is not possible.
After the late-night news on Saturday that the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, even a temporary bailout could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75% to EUR 3,30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing quite well.
While the first-order debt is barely changing, the underlying bond price trends have fallen significantly.
The crisis affects in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and the maturities beyond 2009 in a tangible way.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their stability in value must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the onset of the banking crisis and the near-completion of the crisis by the financial institution's takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are still willing to support the system, the starting point is to pay the premiums on time.
Or what happens is that at the moment almost no one dares hope to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of reports on partial nationalization, the marginal probability has now been reduced to mere legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to divest themselves of their investment can cause sleepless nights.
Short-term investors can nevertheless use the sale to save for taxes due on exchange rate gains in future years.
Sylvana and the Secret of the Tin Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is introduced to Tachibana High School on her first day of classes, the girls start to shout: "The German girl is a total kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - she's writing about Japan in the new exchange blog.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so nervous.
I was on my way to school, and I was so high.
I live in the suburbs of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and it's a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, and I was lucky I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to gather at eight o'clock, until a short conversation with the teacher begins at 8:40 o'clock, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have my school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my hostess, plus a blouse, blue knee socks, and black leather shoes.
So I was standing in front of the chair in this outfit, and I was trying to say everything correctly: "Szajonara, vo ne Sylvana"... My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years earlier.
All 31 girls whispered, cried and waved, and I kept hearing the word "kawai".
I knew that from my manga.
It's a basic Japanese girl's word, and it means "cute, sweet".
Then I quickly fell asleep.
The girl sitting next to me was smiling, and she was honored to be seated next to the exchange student.
The rest of the clock was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran as normal.
Everyone was talking and laughing and asking questions that drilled a hole in my stomach - and it is quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
After the break, everybody unpacked their pants.
My hostess made me one of those lunches - it's a far cry from the boring German ten-pound sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, sausages, a cucumber-and-algae salad, fruit, and a tofu-cured meat.
I don't know what I'm eating in Japan most of the time.
The food looks strange and has a completely new flavor.
In fact, everything is very good.
Well, yeah, except maybe the salted plum, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bentō is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl will give a boy a handmade bentō, which she will make especially artistically - hoping to get to know the boy more intimately during the lunch break.
I read about it in my comic books.
I wonder if I can observe that here.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it just fascinates me".
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture they portray, I started learning Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to come here at some point.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are highly prized here.
Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends - but also strict, disciplined, and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen".
Rats have feelings too.
If a rat or a moth is in danger, it will run away.
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have feelings.
But how can we test whether they feel the same way when they behave in a way that we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing articles by renowned scientists for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE has a series of articles on the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, which I or anyone else has not been able to prove, and it's true that we can't even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, at least, we can hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as we study other species and we examine questions of perception or consciousness in general, we get into difficult terrain because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: It pretends to be dead, flies or attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, which some researchers have concluded is a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits related to human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/management functions).
This vast area is more highly developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other living things.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as our sense of who we are or our ability to plan and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that we are different from even other primates.
Another dramatic feature of man's linguistic nature is that since much of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if language were not a determining factor in consciousness, language would certainly be a determining factor, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's difficult to say what the other animals are conscious of.
If consciousness is not something that can be measured internally and subjectively, and if it is not something that can be analyzed based on our own experience because of the special hardware, then its research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my talk is about the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals could be studied independently of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this hypothesis, also studied by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: They may be the same or not.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the development of visualization.
What does this mean for emotions?
I'm going to trace this back to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the brain, which is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) takes over the working memory.
So, when we look at it, emotions are closely linked to areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
And with language, we have subtle degrees of perception, because with words and with language, we can distinguish and categorize states, and describe them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, argues that emotions come from the simpler activities of the cortex and the body sensory areas of the brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions of species.
I can't dispute that in theory, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can we check that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach fleeing danger, does it feel fear?
I think that just because you have similar behavior doesn't mean you have the same experience.
Although neural comparisons are helpful, rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas cockroaches don't.
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions?
And even if we could prove it in humans, how would we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches, who knows, have feelings.
However, I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm more interested in the emotional behavior of rats than their emotional emotions.
However, there's a lot of progress in this area at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and consciousness in rats, I don't study emotions because I don't know if they exist.
To others, this may seem shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly running into a wall.
I'm a practical emotional guy, you know.
Platini, UEFA President: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashyunik of Ukraine said that the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees in the UEFA Bordeaux decision the confidence in Ukraine and the testimony of their belief that Ukraine is capable of organising the European Championship together with Poland", Vashyunik said.
"But this is not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much to do in both countries".
Both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at a high speed now", said Grigory Surkis, president of the Football Federation of Ukraine.
"UEFA will be watching us constantly".
In Poland, they were going to take a more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN association following a series of scandals, and was replaced by Independent Supervisory Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
'We have written to Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, assuring him that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Championship.'
Only last season, several major league teams were forced to drop to the lower division due to manipulation, and eventually the league start was postponed.
Angry Dennis Quaid is back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, she spoke about her personal life in an interview and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband, and Ryan has described her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid, as an adulterer.
The one who stumbles and then retaliates
The late war of the roses in Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-married couple: Two Hollywood actors fight ugly in public seven years after their divorce.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Ryan first revealed the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, which caused me a lot of pain".
And it wasn't until after the divorce that she found out how many women Dennis had cheated on her.
The psychological strip was created to promote Ryan's new film, "Women", which tells the story of an adulterous marriage.
Dennis Quaid reacted strongly to the claim of an unfaithful husband: "It's horrible", the 54-year-old actor told the "New York Daily News", "that Meg is tirelessly repeating and reworking the story of our relationship".
It is also "unfortunate" that 16-year-old boy Jack is repeatedly "publicly reminded of the pain and change that divorce can cause a child".
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered twins.
So his answer concludes with the following passage: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is perfectly fine".
Airfares and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
A recent study shows that air travel in Germany has become as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Airfares and hotel rooms have again become more affordable, according to a study by American Express, a travel and financial services company.
The company analysed the booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after the first quarter price increase, found a significant price decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, lodging has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 per cent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared with 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6% lower in the period from April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express attributes the decline in the dollar to "a declining travel appetite among American tourists".
The decline in hotel room prices is more pronounced in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent, a European record.
Air ticket prices also showed an increasing trend in the first quarter.
The increase in the price of kerosene meant that passengers had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more in the tourist category than in 2007, and the cost of long-haul flights with high fuel consumption increased by 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the average price of tourist class tickets decreased by 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, but business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11,9%, and in the second quarter, they decreased by 23,6%.
The study found that the cost of domestic flights in Germany has fallen by half.
The reason for the price decrease is, on the one hand, the slowing economic growth, the company claims.
Demand was weak in several segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the USA and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
The tense situation is illustrated by the cancellation of loss-making flights by airlines, and the bankruptcy of a number of airlines in the first half of 2008, involving 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV is beating Gladbach 1-0.
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV topped the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still can't find the operational team.
Kristoffer Klein is broadcasting Deep Flight for the national team, Marko Marin.
Gladbach came in late and his lift bounced off the goal.
His well-worded message left his lips convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered from the hallway leading to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been the physical therapist for HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying more prestige than some of the early players.
His request was therefore heard by the competent authority.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and unanimously raised his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
His order could have been, "Goal two".
The order was not executed.
"Today was not always a good day", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt had a "lower imagination" about it too.
The 1-0 (1:0) goal score is due to the Hamburgers' head Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachs could not cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty win", Martin Jol concluded.
Hamburger SV is 121 years old on Monday.
By Saturday afternoon, the spectators were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the projector sign that showed their team as the championship's top seed.
It's going to be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it", said Marcell Jansen.
You're guessing that the interim certificate on the chart is more indicative of the league's unpredictability than HSV's dominance.
Although the team is slowly recovering from the late acquisitions - Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern - it is not yet brilliant.
"We need more senses and more cuddling", Jol insisted.
After the vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
The first reports of the rescue package's failure have temporarily lowered the Dow Jones to 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day loss in history.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the barometer of the world's most important stock market was down a good 5 percent to 10,579 points.
The tech-dealing paper Nasdaq has dropped more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The biggest loser on the Dow at this point was American Express with a 14 percent loss, followed by Bank of America with a 12 percent loss.
Not a single paper has been consolidated.
The Goldman Sachs bank stock has fallen by almost 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the bank had been bought by Warren Buffett, a major investor.
The rescue is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called 'doubtful mortgages'.
However, the amount is not to be paid at once but gradually.
In return, the State would receive stock option notes from financial institutions which, if the exchange rates were to change, would be redeemable, reducing the burden on the State.
In the decline in European and US and stock prices
The billions in aid to European and American banks do not dispel investors' doubts.
The stock price of Hypo Real Estate, the German big bank, is going down, and Dax is going down with it.
The Dow Jones is falling despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the government.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The value of shares in the Munich real estate financer fell by a quarter, despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax has fallen below the psychological threshold of 6,000 points, and has recorded a minus 3.7 percent score of 5,839.
Stock markets around the world have been brought to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened at a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout will not be enough to stimulate financial markets.
The Dow fell 334 points in the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives has voted on the bailout, and the Senate is scheduled to vote on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges are also on the same track: in London, the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after an initial gain.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index fell by 506.43 points or 3.9 percent to close at 12,595.75 points.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the capital increase.
Sal Oppenheimer Private Bank has listed 23 million new shares.
The Commercial and Tourism Group also announced that it would not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter is affecting the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon that has puzzled scientists for years is dark matter, which affects the speed of space probes during what is known as the swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be completely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew in space for nearly 18 years.
The fuel lines are about to freeze and he's about to freeze to death.
Scientists have been puzzled for years by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational swinging of space probes to gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physics trick.
But what has puzzled researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave exactly as one would expect under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are speed anomalies.
The probes are accelerating or slowing down unexpectedly.
Physicists have yet to find an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was dubbed the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which views the gravitational pull of matter as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, still firmly believes that Einstein was right, and he's trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts have discovered in the universe.
"Dark matter, which may even be found in the vicinity of Earth, may be responsible for the anomaly", writes Adler.
Space scientists only learned about dark matter ten years ago.
It obviously exerts a gravitational force that we can observe affecting other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, meaning that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up about a fifth of the universe's total mass.
Abducted tourists in Egypt freed
After spending 10 days in captivity, tourists who were kidnapped in Egypt are free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers have demanded millions of euros in ransom.
In the shooting that preceded the release of the hostages, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
Five German nationals have been abducted in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is reporting on the most important cases.
European tourists stranded in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arabic TV and the Italian media.
According to the Italian television station Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our compatriots and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently monitoring their health", said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as eight Egyptian accomplices, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostage takers had already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed six of them in a surprise attack.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom", the official said.
"The trial was about taking the hostages, "when suddenly, the surprise happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers and arrested two on Sunday at the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
Al-Mashri al-Jom daily, citing a German media outlet, reported that the hostages' release was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned for their safety.
According to the report, the hostage-takers release the female hostages after the ransom is paid.
The men are being held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
"Suicide" from Stepfather Violence
The court ruled that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been abusing her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, spent six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of attempted aggravated sexual assault.
The Criminal Court in Truro has learned that he regularly bound his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of his confessions, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for his death".
The trial concluded that Randle committed suicide at his home in the Mutley area of Plymouth on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise was bound and blindfolded before intercourse while her mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his home again.
His stepmother moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court hearing it was revealed that Miss Randle, who had spent much of her time as a volunteer with the National Trust, was haunted by the nightmarish images of violence that recurred twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, was described by her friends as "emotionally dead" and "abandoned".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his Plymouth apartment.
He probably choked on a bag.
Mr. Randle had a falling out with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his confession in a letter: "I always tied her up and blindfolded her.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure that was terrible for your victim, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family affair ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more sobering is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have come to trial".
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to what Stephanie's parents believe your crime has done to their daughter over the years.
If that had not happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful, happy young woman".
The official who lost the important data was charged
The BBC reports that a government official has been charged with breach of official secrecy for leaving top-secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on a Department of Defense expert mission when he left two top-secret documents on a train headed to Waterloo.
The documents were delivered to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is a minor violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intent.
Frank Gardner, the BBC's correspondent for the Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal matter", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, was charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which is about the retention of information.
The prosecution has recommended that the Metropolitan Police represent the charges against the officer because of his sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included classified intelligence reports on al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi military.
He was notified of the decision on Monday, and then moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
Housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B bill
UK housing co-operatives can count on a savings of over £80 million following the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent £14 billion protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies using the depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Housing Co-operatives Association (BSA), said it was "annoying" that companies and their members had to pay.
The repayment of the 14 billion euro loan will finally take place after the repayment of the bonds of Bradford & Bingley.
However, the accrued interest is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It's annoying that institutions that have been so cautious... are now having to pay the bills of institutions that have been far less cautious.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 to supplement this Regulation.
We found that each company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit they have, and companies share 18 percent of the cost among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside £81 million to pay the interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the chief executive of the Housing Workers' Union, told the BBC he thought the measure was unfair.
"It is disgusting that these institutions should have to pay the bills of far less prudent institutions that acted prudently during the boom in the housing market".
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since it began operations in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to decide how to protect the housing companies and their members from the significant amount of bill", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, a full year's interest will be payable, which may be as much as double the current rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organisations without shareholders, the members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence a liter.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of milk by another five pence per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-penny increase in February and following a survey by a consulting firm.
Retailers decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladesh MP's request to defend himself in freedom was denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for the release of former MP Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court denied him a free trial on charges that he extorted 50 million takas ($729,700) from a businessman during his time as a member of parliament.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country's military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, the terms of his release do not make it clear whether he will be able to retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he's now going to appeal the Supreme Court's decision to the Court of Appeals.
"The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying it was not necessary as she had been released on bail and was receiving medical treatment abroad", we learned from Rafique-ul Huq's lawyer.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal".
His lawyers argue that he needs the parole defense to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A senior member of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan were left out of the recent polio vaccination program because of Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the UN organized vaccination operations in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesman said this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or interfere with the work of thousands of staff who were vaccinating.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV is dismissed
BskyB's appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission, which ordered it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV, was dismissed.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The Commission has previously concluded that BSkyB's shareholding is a competitive barrier and gives it unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of shares by BSkyB from ITV would jeopardise the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
Virgin's CEO, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's oversight were all opposed to the takeover.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The U.S. Attorney's office is re-examining the case.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 firing of nine U.S. attorneys.
The move followed a report on the case by the Chief Inspector of the Judicial Branch which criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because there was a concern that the prosecutors were being fired for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, special counsel, will now investigate whether the officers interviewed in the investigation attempted to obstruct justice by lying.
"The serious charges of possible criminal activity have not been investigated or cleared", said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. attorneys from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, they said the prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the fired prosecutors received no worse ratings than many of their colleagues, leading many to conclude that political considerations were behind the firings.
Some prosecutors have been involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others have refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are on the government's investigative and prosecutorial staff.
They can be removed at any time, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was the target of attacks over the layoffs and eventually resigned.
Several other officials of the Judicial Branch also resigned.
In his report, the inspector general heavily criticized Gonzales for his role in the case, saying the attorney general "has taken primary responsibility" for the layoffs, "resigned" from his commanding role, and "significantly withdrew" from the process.
He's criticized other officials, including Karl Rove, former aide to Bush Sr., for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf is being celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive a special gold award at the London gala next week, said he was honored to be recognized.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations at this year's awards, with four nominations.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genre, and 'Bat Out Of Hell' is like that".
The song that Jim Steinman got was a very loud voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" was on the charts for almost nine years, and it sold over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, real name Marvin Lee Aday, has been struggling with health issues recently, including having heart failure surgery in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few shows because of acute bronchitis.
It turned out that she had a cyst on her vocal cords.
An unknown city street, often forgotten and perhaps soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, byways, and other byways, some of which are famous, others of which are merely practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents would have difficulty telling where the Extra Place is, mostly because they had never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village, and it runs north from First Street -- without reaching Second Street -- between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, and it's more like a dusty alley than a major transportation route.
There are no street signs.
It's practically impossible to find on a standard map.
But the street has its admirers.
There's, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to re-cover the Extra Place and make sure that the shops and boutiques in the new buildings can be accessed by a cleaner route.
Admirers of the street include longtime neighbors who were struck by the cobblestone alley as the only remnant of the pre-revolutionary past of the neighborhood.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the city's Department of Building Conservation and Development, to insist on it.
This month, at a meeting of the county land board, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the developer would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain under city management and has requested a new plan be submitted by next month, reported Susan Stetzer, district manager of City Council No. 3.
"There's very little land already owned by the city, and we want Extra Place to remain owned by the city", he said.
"There are proposals for its renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public".
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that they were re-paving the street with seating, some of which would be used by a cafe, which the developer is expected to lease a plot of land to.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first announced at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the street, they did not insist on owning it.
"The main focus of Avalon Bay is to renovate this run-down alley and turn it into a pleasant public space", he said, adding that the city had recommended the purchase.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Preservation Office, said the city was really looking to sell the street, and noted that the office's job is to develop the buildings, not to manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place doesn't have much historical significance.
Some say it was named "no man's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's vast estate was divided among his numerous children, and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The punk-rock monument CBGB, which closed in 2006, opened its back door to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most famous for being the location of the cover photo for the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great scene", said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clothes, barrel and poster pieces, and wallpaper and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how he took over the middle-class East Village, are opposed to the sale of the Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York", posted on his blog a portion of the Extra Place story that appeared in the weekly "Warsaw Rumor" column of The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, little alleyway that is dark even in the daytime, bordered by rusty, iron-framed store doors and stained-glass windows, and where weekly newspapers are blown down the drains".
The street, with few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street at the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, now a high-priced clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75-gallon beer bottle was lying next to a discarded, fresh pile of newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think it's worth renovating.
Fields said he thought some people underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, grimy, disgusting places", he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English-speaking environment
In this section, the Education Observer discusses the views of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior researcher in California studies and senior director of education research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is the co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
It's not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
And that includes Barack Obama's education proposals.
The Obama campaign says, "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and that's true.
To address such performance gaps, the Obama Education Plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
But for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes non-English language instruction, outweighs his interest in addressing the wide achievement gap.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the students at the school are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students - many of whom are recent arrivals - are learning English.
Yet, 100% of fourth graders did well on the 2008 state maths exam.
Equally impressive, 93% of fourth graders scored highly in English and literature.
They've achieved this incredible feat by not using the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street emphasizes repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of skills and the rejection of excuses.
And also, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is to "fully immerse" students learning English in the language environment.
The essence of the assimilation method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We have had overwhelming success in not noticing the student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier when he walked into a classroom".
"It works", he said, "It works for us".
Would Obama set an example for the other significant numbers of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students at schools like Sixth Street Prep?
The school's achievements should be clear to answer, but because of his own party's education policies (the National Education Association has long been a supporter of bilingual education) and because he himself is a consistent advocate for bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a slight statement on the issue when he said that people should not worry so much about the "purely English nature" of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should make sure their children speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to get the gap between results down, he should seriously study the models that work, instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Renewed economic concerns have led to a sharp fall in oil prices
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that America's financial-market bailout plan will fail to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell seven percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock market has been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and a few powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before being hit again by the immense uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again worried, even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached a deal over the weekend on the largest economic bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not end for long.
As the latest event in the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire the Wachovia Corporation banking business, the government announced Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts say that after the desperate weekend negotiations, "the bailout appears to have failed to stimulate stock market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities such as oil is expected to decline.
"The future of equity, interest rates, and foreign exchange markets has become uncertain worldwide", wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank to investors.
"We believe that the pandemic will not escape the commodities market.
The biggest question from the point of view of the stock market is the extent to which the US "disease" is infecting the whole world, especially China".
As oil consumption declined due to slowing economic growth, bank analysts cut their forecasts for next year by 20%, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009.
With the team's bravery in the second quarter, they set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets' farm system than anyone else over the past eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
But then he watched the second-quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a no-hitter into a sensation.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals' game was in perfect sync with the towering dark clouds in the sky.
Quarterback Brett Favre threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, setting the stage for an afternoon in which their evolving collaboration would evolve significantly.
Favre also threw two touchdown passes to Coles in this quarter, including one in which two cornerbacks were down in a row 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't feel sorry for the effort", Favre said of all the passes he gave to Coles.
"Damn good player.
We've been able to communicate well so far, regardless of what people think".
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis caught a bad throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety, slipped into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last lap would have been the most impressive move in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds to go and the Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to tie the score at 34:0.
That was the best score the Jets have ever had in a quarter.
When Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When told that both were good - the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter and the Jets didn't score a single point - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short time".
Gebrselassie, who is rested, breaks his own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why he is considered by many to be the greatest middle- and long-distance runner of all time when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first person to run the 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With his victory in a comfortable 2:03:59 on the flat track, Gebrselassie improved his previous record of 2:04:26 set in Berlin last year by 27 seconds.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set the 26th world record of his career in so many different distances that he had won or set world records in almost every event from the 1500 meters to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps an over-cautiousness in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed me up for the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, first at 9 °C and then at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since previously untrained runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have turned to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with a time of 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had a sprained ankle and was unable to train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, he refreshed himself and didn't get rusty.
"I'm so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters, "I'm so happy to be here today".
"Everything was going perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but everything was fine".
He has received some criticism - particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - that he uses too many auxiliary equipment in his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathoners, relies on pace runners as if he were running on a track, and puts world records ahead of the competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie's greatness in the long distance.
Gebrselassie crossed the finish line in 1:02:04 with four Kenyan sprinters on Sunday.
Two leading Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the pace runners were exhausted.
Just over 3 miles (4.8 km) from the finish, Gebrselassie sprinted one last time to knock out Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, 5 minutes better than his personal best.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with her seventh-fastest win of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon by a surprise with a time of 2:24:14.
He was unable to compete in the Beijing Olympics due to a supposed back injury, but recovered quickly and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his individual best by five minutes, the third marathon distance he had run.
He calculated wisely and won the race, first allowing a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain a considerable lead, then following them after running about 20 miles [30 km].
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third with a time of 2:25:01.
A city isolated, black pride and trials
In the Greater Orlando theme park, just a few miles from everything glittering, loud and mighty, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complexity of the African-American experience was born.
Eatonville, the first black city to integrate into the country, and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was in 1935 when she described it as "a town of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas, and two schools, no jail".
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora Festival, the Eatonville celebration series honoring the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet in many ways, the city he described as a tourist attraction - which is also featured in the Florida Travel Guide published by the Crisis Writers' Federation Project - is separate from its surroundings.
As independent, dignified, and self-absorbed as it was in the 1930s, when, Hurston writes, urban blacks in Florida were often reluctant to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing".
Even in the year that black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages open discussion on the issue of race, many here are suspicious of the outsiders' gaze.
"We are very careful about how we tell our story", said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"You have to tell it right".
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
It's both a historic model of black representation and a community of almost 2,400 people with poverty rates that are twice the national average.
Partly a literary hub, partly an example of the American slavery, sometimes disdained, sometimes glorified, of the Southern, urban, black culture that thrives in the shade of oak trees.
Not surprisingly, the people here are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (that's what everyone here calls Hurston).
In books written in a frank, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida Guidebook have transformed the city, which sits along Route 17, from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the most historic sites in black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was as brave in life and literature as a drummer, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then to the more intimate realms.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, on a brown ground with white borders, with carefully kept yards and playgrounds, maintained by Howard Miller, though he can hardly read or write".
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything you might need for temporary accommodations".
So in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It's clear Fodor's travel guide has a different description.
That description really didn't sit well with everyone.
"Zora told things as they were", recalled Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's daughters, whom Hurston immortalized by quoting the silly songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that".
Hurston is still remembered here as the living freak who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a rumble Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and in long pants in a city where people still pride themselves on their dignified dress.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were flattered.
"People were always happy to see Zora", Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair: "I never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer being reprinted.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
There were no major memorials or major public readings at Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, "In the Rainbow".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane highway, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in community life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the interstate highway 4 on the city's western border.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950's, racial strife filled the community with hatred.
"A group of white boys came by and threw oranges and other things at people sitting on the side of the road", Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a melon out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's decision to forcibly integrate, stating that Brown v. Board of Education "offends my race more than it respects it".
Today, residents say that while the school desegregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to being killed - I remember that - by hugging their teachers in the morning and in the evening", reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the nonprofit organization Protect the Eatonville Community.
"This continued until the students and teachers came from the same place", he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because she was a white teacher - I mean, we had cultural differences", Nathiri said.
But human rights helped to lift up many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who stood up to prejudice as he did, with such exhilarating self-confidence and lines as, "How can anyone deprive himself of the pleasure of my company?
It's incomprehensible to me".
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered to Hurston's unmarked grave and began a struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a well-regarded biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared on the bookstore shelves, re-establishing him as one of America's leading figures.
The road project would have started just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was back in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as the savior.
In 1988, the community began organizing a Hurston Festival to show what the county was about to ruin with its mainline.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the celebration every January since.
A few years later, the county dropped the road project.
"The five-lane highway has given the community a new lease of life, a full speed, which is a real civic pride", said Nathiri.
Boyd put it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the road project helped to change the image the city had of itself.
And more and more people from outside the city, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer, who started going to church here in 1993, and the locals started to reassess the past.
Eatonville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened on the re-paved and redecorated Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's quintessential city: less than 10 miles from downtown Orlando, but it sometimes feels like a suburban back street in the summer rains; it's as small as it was when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They're still wary of outsiders coming here looking for something to say about Eatonville's story.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest mural, painted by a white man and depicting black people working the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
In Eatonville, many - including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red - fear that their isolated community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew in scope, so did the pride of the hometown.
Young people in particular are increasingly seeing Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with problems and all, no better or worse, just as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
Sincere civic attachment is silenced by the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to take a job with the local government or the police, which he feels need help.
And it seems that even younger people have learned to properly describe Eatonville, like the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just pass by think that this city is nothing compared to the rest", said Alondra Kenon recently after a Sunday service.
"But if you stop and take a little time to learn about its history, it's a very beautiful city".
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists were not concerned about the newsstands and the giant television sets in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the midst of a storm.
They'd never realize that with their glass-walled, bee-shaped offices overhead, the bankers and hedge fund managers who hold New York City in their power are having their worst days since 1929.
Couriers still roll their metal tea carts along the sidewalks, carrying trays loaded with muffins to morning meetings.
Spanish-speaking men still roam the brick houses, carrying as human mules some 50 or so embroidered shirts hanging on a yoke-like loop across the shoulders.
Office workers are still queuing for their morning sweet pastries at the sidewalk food trucks, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a weekday.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
I had deliberately planned to do it during the afternoon rush at my local branch of J.P. Morgan Chase, but there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cashier's window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's, and new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the banker I was "assigned" - lined up with the same intent as I did.
But unlike me, they've already taken their money out of smaller banks in their home state, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was taken from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and supposedly treat their customers like family members.
In the last year, 15 of these banks went silently bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, has been on the brink of bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a $440 billion savings-saving buyer.
The office and store workers in front of me, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to what seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
The average New Yorker has become an expert in finance over the last few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese department store on the phone talked about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers and its big-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, 50-year-old janitor of my block, switched the subject, not talking about Brad and Angelina or my food delivery, as we usually do.
After I went to the bank, he said to me: "I have invested all my savings in financial market instruments.
I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party attended a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 in which the organization "Variants Against the Islamic Conquest" was introduced.
They marched with signs that mimicked traffic signs, depicting mosques crossed by red lines.
Police believe far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Austrian Muslim cemeteries, which occurred on the same weekend that far-right parties made significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Trauni Cemetery outside Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, police said.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but investigators say they were merely trying to hide their extremist motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if the incident could be connected in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" to hear of the desecration, which took place just before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is holding a conscience test following yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the language of the political balance has shifted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, has expressed displeasure with the campaign against headscarves and burqas, as well as the food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party's final congress in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" as a means to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which resulted in a victory for the far-right, suggest that the change was largely due to a young voter base, who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign trip
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges ruled in favor of Glitter's six-month ban after he notified the authorities controlling him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police have obtained a travel ban until Thursday after they presented evidence to the court regarding Glitter's convictions for child rape.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Magistrates' trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent Police filed a petition with Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd's planned trip to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd has not appeared in person".
Glitter, 64, notified the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he was required to do so by the Sex Offenders' Register Act.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you don't notify the authorities, you could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent P.D. has said they don't want to talk about any specific cases within Glitter County or his possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "The Kent Police Department is doing everything it can to protect children at home and abroad.
'We think it's easier to check someone if they don't leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The Kent Police Department considers it their primary responsibility to protect the people of Kent. "Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of people on the sex offender registry and those living in the county to minimize any potential risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to be transferred to a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he was feeling ill and refused to fly to London.
The authorities in the country refused to let him pass the passport examination, so he ended up flying to Hong Kong.
He was also denied entry by the Chinese authorities, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the territorial police and immigration officials insisted he return to the UK.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, having been placed on the register of sex offenders by a court order at the request of Scotland Yard.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of photographs depicting child rape.
According to a Home Office source, Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, was relieved and pleased that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not taking pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal point of view"
No makeup, no hair or dance shoes.
The great masters of flamenco, close to the body, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the ordinary faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
Ordinary people, on the other hand.
And these two sides are not separated, except in those intimate moments, away from the audience, when we can experience a personal movement, capture the depth of a caught gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the still but expressive hands of an artist who is preparing to perform on stage.
In his photography series Flamenco-people, German Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known, mundane side of the masters.
Through the photographs, he shows the unique iconography of flamenco from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the month of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the growing international significance of flamenco", says the creator, adding that the Flamenco-people "can be played by anyone, because when the viewer sees the images, he is surprised that these images do not represent the artists in a typical way.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
But stage photography is not the way to capture their personalities.
Their personality and character are deep within them.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personalities of the great flamenco artists through the camera".
The Cante de las Minas festival gave Bauer a boost to his long journey in 1997, during which he took portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
This portrait is a classic example of photography, thanks to its camera and choice of subject.
However, the use of various stylistic means breaks with traditional pictorial representation and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's view of flamenco: "It is a music with traditional roots, but it changes day by day and is always fascinating".
It's not the dance, it's not the singing or the music itself, it's the personality of the artist, the character that fascinates the audience.
The main theme of the works that can be seen at El Fotomatá Gallery these days is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
The names of famous flamenco figures, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the hallmarks of this photography collection, which features almost sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in an album of portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the series "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is somewhat different, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
I think the hardest part of photography is portraiture.
You meet people, personalities, who sometimes you don't even know, or who only have a few minutes to take pictures.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my vision come true.
The exhibition, entitled Flamenco-people, selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, will be on view until 16 October at the El Fotomatata Gallery, located at 20 calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "ready-made adventure"
The location and the action are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is working on his new novel, which is about an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has also traveled the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning author admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that his current work is "a bold venture" and "all signs indicate that it should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I hope to finish it one day", he said at the end of his talk at the festival of ideas, ideas and opinions, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors for four days in the town of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literary festival and also changed the hopes attached to him.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival prize voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend".
The audience was greeted by a devoted audience after the greeting of Félix Romeo. The audience was quickly overwhelmed by the hour, during which the Peruvian writer told with astonishing memory and a great deal of humor how his writing career developed from the special adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live life; how he overcomes the lack of inspiration through a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, many corrections and rewrites; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing career, and what memories his stories are based on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show that books change our lives, but he added: "I do not think that literature is mere entertainment or a pure-life experience", since it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to succumb to the temptation of ease and to take responsibility for their vocation.
The weather is so bad that the Pozoblanco farewell is cut short, and the bullfights are cancelled.
The bullfighting event, traditionally held as the closing ceremony of the Pozoblanco festivities, was cancelled yesterday morning after the bullfighters found the arena unsuitable for the event.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfight.
Weather conditions had a severe impact on the festivities, as two of the three events could not be held.
Saturday's second bullfight was canceled because of rain.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought with the bulls of Castilblanco.
So they only had bullfights on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three trophies for his ears, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic fight, he was carried around on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won several awards and trophies with his two bulls, but thanks to the audience rather than his own performance.
But then came El Juli, who did little to make the Los Llanos arena look old.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience was able to pull off the rope.
In Avila, a two-tonne hash truck tried to escape traffic control.
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police is conducting traffic control in the administrative area of Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities stop a van with two passengers trying to escape the order.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not conspicuous.
Investigators pursued the passengers and arrested one of them, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to the Basque government's Department of Internal Affairs.
The man arrested is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred in the Armiñón administrative area, where employees of the Alavai Traffic Control were conducting traffic control on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to comply, suddenly gave off the gas, and then left the checkpoint.
Detectives chased him, and the vehicle stopped a few miles away on a curb, and the passengers fled the highway into a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally caught one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The police transported hashish balls from the rear of the vehicle to undergo more thorough testing and to measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection it was found that the fake vehicle number plate did not match the data in the van's documents, therefore the arrested person is also prosecuted for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing the investigation, which aims to arrest the other suspect, who, as mentioned, fled the highway, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old accused, A. A. J., was taken to the police station for the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
An eyewitness said he tried to make strange maneuvers to leave the parking lot in Montecitto, a spokesman for California's traffic control told People magazine.
According to the witness, at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pushed the gas to the floor, cranked the engine, tried to leave the parking lot back and forth, and went through his sunglasses several times on the way back".
Shortly after, an eyewitness, who may not have recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear pull over on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also alerted the police because he was "concerned for Locklear's life".
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"He seemed confused", so the patrol officers took him to a center that specializes in drug and alcohol testing.
A police spokesman said the actress was cooperative and alcohol was ruled out almost immediately, adding that officers first thought she was under the influence of Locklear.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unidentified substance and taken to the local jail at around 7pm, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear was released two months ago from an Arizona sanatorium where he was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to act on Silva's case
Gaspar Llamazares, the IU's secretary general and representative of the United Left, said today that the union's regional federation will decide on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, the former youth and sports adviser to the Seville municipal government, who resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit his family.
"I am far from a federalist in these matters, and this matter is certainly within the competence of the Andalusian organization", Llamazares pointed out the procedure the party should apply to the former Seville city council member.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that 'transparency' should be taken into account when investigating any irregularities committed by Silva: 'The IU has always been committed to ensuring that cases of this nature are as transparent as possible.'
He added that the training included "a strict code of ethics for civil servants".
"Blood of May", by Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós's National Episodes was inspired by José Luis García, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in Blood of May, which, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros, is the most ambitious work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate the human flow and social analysis that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, all of which Garci told to a crowded audience of actors today in the company of the film's presenters Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two and a half hours of Blood of May will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and later will be shown as a four-hour miniseries in excess of four hours in the Telemadrid.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, realized his childhood dream with this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events of May 2 in Madrid.
The $15 million budget was entirely funded by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci to showcase, with age-old decorations and costumes, "the confused Spaniards who had mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, as the struggle for independence had pushed the country into a huge backwardness under Ferdinand VII", he said.
The director, however, expressed regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's Phantoms, which kicked the blood of May more than twice, and was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which - as on many other occasions - are written together with Horacio Valcarcel.
So the director of "Restart" used his usual method of working, shooting scenes with actors he had already started rehearsals with before filming, and casting was not, because Garci considered it "humiliating", and because, as he said, "part of the art of directing is going to the theater and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in".
Several actors of Blood of May, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not step in front of the camera for the first time.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations and one Oscar, believes that none of the candidates representing Spain in the Hollywood Academy this year, namely Blood of May, the Seven French Billiards tables and the Blind Sundials, who were finally selected, represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented", he said.
Garci doesn't expect any prizes with this film.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that success is all that matters, and then you're happy to have another movie made", says Garci, who has been working professionally for 30 years.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville remembers a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, who is of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
She was a freestyle dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
During her active life, she was a pioneer in the fight for women's equality, whether it was Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against wearing a tie that restricted women's freedom of movement.
She sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in war-torn Europe, and her life fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, she recommended me to Tortola, whose personality really impressed me".
The flamenco dancer stated: "Our goal is not to tell your life story, but to capture your spirit.
The titles of your dances remind me of flamenco styles.
For example, the "butterfly dance" is the guajira, or the "snake dance" is the tango.
"They feel like dancing, and others say that's how I do it", she says.
The show is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, who is now singing again in Isabel's performance after Open Doors; and Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with a former student in this case.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you've accepted my invitation, and I'm honored to have you in my play".
In addition, the production features music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pájaro on drums, Rafa El Viola on percussion, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a constant character that constantly besieges the real diva with his love".
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels through Europe, reaching even lands that were considered distant at the time, including India, the United States, and Italy.
"I wanted to honor him because his personality was so influential in his own time, but today his work is not known and even less appreciated", says Bayón.
The performance begins at 8:30 tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, there's also "The Diary of a Newly Married Poet".
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of the program series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of two of them.
The Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium thus concludes with the re-release of the work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial, and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Bright Summer Tree", which opened in May, visited several Andalusian provinces, and is scheduled to visit New York in time for the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Regional Government of Andalusia has obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the Diary of a Newly Married Poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that".
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman on Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman's death caused in American cinema and across America.
I mean, how hard it was for him to win an Oscar.
He retired in 2007.
And he was known to be sick.
But still, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it is impossible to put our feelings into words, and I have now lost a good friend", said Robert Redford, tearfully, "whose existence has made my life and this country better".
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of cinema and the homeland passed away in a particularly dark time, overshadowed by terrorism and fear of market conditions, American self-respect and a desperate search for dignity.
When times are tough and many people lose their virtues easily and there are so few people left to look up to, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a defender of lost and won causes, from the Anti-Drug Foundation, created in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose, to the creation of his home-made organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had a hard time getting over its suicide-food culture.
A wave of admiration has swept Hollywood, regardless of nationality or origin.
The last James Bond, according to the Englishman Daniel Craig, was not a man, but an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, stated that his collaboration with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He set the bar very high for all of us", said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few today who tries to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: demanding honesty and a serious and uncensored privacy.
That's not always easy, if possible, in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is a role model.
He was divorced once, but for the next fifty years he was faithfully married to Joanne Woodward, although he would certainly have had many occasions for infidelity.
"Why would I eat hamburgers anywhere else when I have fried meat at home?" he joked.
He's proud of his daughters on earth, which is not very common in America.
"In all his roles", says one account, "he was more proud of his roles as a loyal husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted humanitarian".
The road to the Olympics in Madrid
Indeed, many of us dream of the Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 failure, we may have the 2016 Olympics.
But I'm asking, are we really prepared for that?
Because if we're going to start from yesterday's race, I don't think we are.
It was called a perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of the many I've ever been in.
It was characterized by a mass of nonsense, and if it were to be evaluated once, and I were the examiner, it would clearly fail.
But let's go in sequence and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the serial number, which meant you had to arrive early.
That's not a problem in itself, but if you're going to go early, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in the queue later).
That's not what happened.
First, they gave me only the serial number (first nonsense, only so I could get there sooner) and (after the usual line), surprisingly, only an S-shirt (second nonsense, since I have a size XL)!
What kind of world are we living in?
Or did the recession make them decide to save money and just buy cheaper, smaller-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still a lot more than what happened on race day.
Besides the fact that it was awfully early to get the chip, the line lasted 15 minutes from the time we arrived, and even the backpack had to be dropped off.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unfathomable in a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we didn't give up the backpack, and when we did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40-minute wait, which was marred by attempts at rioting and stand-offs, even more pleasant.
I'm guessing that by tomorrow, we'll have 500 confirmed pneumonia cases, and some, including myself, will not be able to get our location in real time, because I'm assuming my chip has miscalculated the start.
If you asked me about the perfect running race, I wouldn't have thought of it, of course.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-equipped Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft unveiled the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence that is not very intelligent, but is capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a vehicle that is traveling on the company's territory) based on information heard from the conversation.
Using a camera and a shape-and-face recognition system, this "receptionist" can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - even what they wear - and hears and understands the key words of their conversations.
It can also group the audience based on the conversations.
In the introduction video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that he is not a member of the company she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if anyone is visiting him and assures him that he will soon come to his aid.
All without the big blue screen.
That is impressive.
But of course, this is the music of the future.
At present, the company has more important tasks to perform, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people have been saying that Microsoft has changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer peripherals.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the programs they needed instead of all the commercial junk, machines would be five times faster -- wow, Steve, that's something.
They invented Spanish breakfast, considering that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to every new version of Windows.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is getting more and more out of hand, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome came online, I joined the theory that Google was taking the first step to compete with Windows.
Many people have correctly understood that a browser is not part of an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, because it's an essential element of the hardware-software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but you have to expect the "death" of the operating system, not in an absolute sense, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
You turn on your computer just to open Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and you spend more and more time browsing than you do in the world of Windows.
So what are most of the applications that come with the system for?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
It's less heavy, less breathing, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services more online and to eventually offer an alternative to Google.
They need Minder badly, and I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken earlier this month at a Microsoft employee chat room in Redmond.
There's a sign on the vending machine that tells them to use the company's browser. "Your browser. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week they announced the release of a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not coming in early 2009, it's coming in the end, in 2010, more like.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
The following is the list of the products covered by the product concerned:
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it's one of the staples of the gay shopping community.
And speaking of the specials, you might recall the peaceful figure of the rat-faced weightlifter from the circus.
It's nothing more than the typically narrow, fingerless male cotton triangle.
I mean, the "tank", as the Angolans call it, but none of the rivals of Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First, because of his elegant name - although among friends he is referred to as "Marcel" - which is due to the sport, as legend has it, he got his name from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel also stands out from its competitors for its excellent cotton, unisex embroidery, its distinctive logo, and the small (but hardly recognizable) Belgian flag, which is worn by the most stylish models hidden in the collar of their shirts.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere scarves, wool trousers, navy t-shirts, sweaters, miniskirts - and more - are all products of the company.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it's unfortunate that you have to wear them as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd like to be a young mother; it doesn't matter who the father is".
He's very much like his brother, but he's also self-actualized.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters are looking to take a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling is about more than just a few pretty girls naming something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris and at the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It is a source of warmth and tenderness.
What are you doing in Paris, anyway?
We're presenting the new fall-winter collection of Mango, which I designed with my sister Penelope, and we're also presenting the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Valentine's Day gala dinner at the Opera House.
It's a busy day, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, so where did you get the inspiration for this new collection?
We both love the music of the '50s and '60s; we've taken a lot from there.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch women dress, and how they vary and choose their clothes -- that's one of my favorite pastimes.
You're a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but ultimately these three things are connected, because they have so much in common.
I was interested in clothes from a very young age, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and look through my aunt's closets.
Well, that was you in Canaan, almost up to an amusement park.
And as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to make up our own style for classes and rehearsals, so we can enjoy looking in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and I have all the respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you fall into a state of lethargy?
Oh, no, not at all.
I feel better than ever. I love the '30s.
I think women are really mature by now, they're more experienced and they make fewer mistakes in life.
And I'm not worried about the biological clock.
Since I was a child, I have done what I feel like doing, and it has given me great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
And as for the father-to-be, whoever it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great, great love.
Let's talk about the cinema, you've made a few movies last year that haven't been shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, wanting everything immediately, but of course I know that it is impossible.
I can't wait for the premiere of The Last Hour and the Search for Christ's Tomb.
I wonder what you'd say to them...
I understand you made your debut on the track a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go to the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she just invited me to a charity fashion show in London that she organized for her organization called Women for a Better World, and I picked out two of my own Mango collections, and the clothes that were on display were auctioned off, and the proceeds were donated to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much stuff going on about him, and I know it, and I can assure you that it's not half true.
On the other hand, I always see the bright side of your business.
You asked me to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if you wanted me to stand up, I would.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I know nothing is impossible.
Recurring drunk drivers will be required to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would require a car to be fitted with a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was drunk or not blowing into the device after three drunk driving violations.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has said that the pilot project will last for one year.
As the project aims to restore traffic, the driver will also have to take a repeat course on traffic education.
In addition to the DG for Transport Safety, the DG for Transport and the Foundation for the Automotive Safety Institute of Technology (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
Statistics show that 30 to 75 percent of repeat drunk drivers get back in their cars.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, because the system linked to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air inhaled.
The cost of the equipment, which is more than 1000 euros, would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 study in the USA showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce the number of infractions by up to 65% in the first year after they are fitted.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: first, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming criminal offences;
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce because the legal reform is implemented at the usual pace, while the necessary criminal reform would require an amendment to the Basic Law.
The instrument is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although it has been installed in some industrial and public vehicles in a pilot mode.
The House of Representatives is voting tomorrow on the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's initiative to install the school bus system in France.
In Mexico, with my shoes on.
At the time of the announcement, at 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force's Asturias Hercegi Party transport plane landed in the Presidential hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already setting, but it was so bright that we could only see the royal couple, using our hands as binoculars, as they stepped out of the plane.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries.
A few hours earlier, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish couple were coming to the city for an official visit.
- Well, then, there won't be an airport transfer for a while... she's from here or something...
No, no, sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press, they know all about the couple of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many wait on the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon formed by 27 Marines who protect the dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a navy blue dress, and then the Princess, with the wind blowing through her long hair, in a restrained dress, but not in her usual high-heeled shoes - perhaps warning that Mexico City is in for a storm.
They pause for a moment and smile for the cameras, then enter the room where the official reception follows.
At the door of their hotel - one of the four largest in the city - a news reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The Most Valuable Fashion Prize
The best place in the world to present a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest of all the fashion designers alive today is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote young fashion talents internationally.
The grand prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own designer clothes at the Mango store at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she almost cried with emotion.
By the way, this is the company's second largest store in Europe and it just opened on 1,335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
Amidst the heated event and the thanksgiving for Valentino for being the jury president, we finally found ourselves at a lavish dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the most exhilarating Chagals, the gala dinner was even more spectacular with the president's table made by Mango.
Nati, who had come with a heavy heart and sadness over the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking jewelry from ELAH, and, with her seven-foot-tall son Luis, accompanied Valentino to the main table of the dinner in her honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests, and they were so chivalrous, along with Baron Rotchil, that they were left without a suit, as they were both given one to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the store in her own designer pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress, and on the night of the opera tour she was so enthralled with Gaya Toledo's company in the ballet hall that she remembered the old days and went over to one of the bars and threw a grand plie party.
Inés Sastre did not attend the visit, but before that she showed some photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning, we were able to admire Oliver Martinez -- he's about six feet tall and he's on a motorcycle -- and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, and he brought his own sheets and towels, and he said in advance that he didn't want any perfume in the room.
Stars under the starry skies of Paris.
Oh, the way it is.
1001, the stressor number
Not a thousand, but a thousand, and there's one way to disconnect from the chaotic and chaotic routine.
The other good news is that we can find it all in one book, which will be arriving in bookstores on September 30th to bring peace of mind.
It's almost torturous to hear the clock ring at 7 a.m., but it's even more torturous to think about the fast-paced life that the world is pushing you into every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is a 21st-century folk disease.
But there are more than one way to cope with daily fatigue and work-related problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massages, and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book to help everyone find the solution that suits their needs and their free time.
The book is called 1001 Relaxation Methods, and the calmness it brings is coming to bookstores from Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you have been convinced that stress is almost impossible to eliminate in the workplace or in personal relationships, this guide will surely shake your faith.
And it also gives you other ideas that help you relax, like tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central issue in your life, it's time to sit back in your chair, relax and focus on reading.
♪ Who talk in their sleep ♪
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean people who wake up and tell what happened to them that day, but people who talk in their sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It's pretty common, especially among children and teenagers.
I'm sure you've heard that he talked at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rhapsodic (such as occurring only once in a high-fever illness) or more regular (once a day, weekly or monthly), and the child usually does not remember anything the next day.
Its appearance cannot be traced to a single cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-time awakenings, nocturnal enuresis, or sleep apnea, but it is not legal.
As mentioned, it can be accompanied by a high fever or even a state of stress or increased excitement.
In any case, it's been little studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be silent, calm, consisting of incoherent words, murmuring, but contrary to all this, it may also take the form of shouting, crying, or prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist.
As mentioned, this is a benign phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure unless it is accompanied by another manageable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
But there are a few things we can do, and here are a few precautions:
Make sure the child is calm before bed.
Choose games that are calming, and avoid letting your child watch TV shows or series that are frightening or more aggressive.
For children who are prone to nervousness or who have difficulty relaxing, we teach them some relaxation techniques to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more soundly.
If he does start talking in his sleep, we try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Practical Advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is unconscious, but it would prevent him from sleeping.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if severe anxiety is repeated, it is advisable to consult a specialist or to find out what triggers the child's severe anxiety.
If he speaks intelligibly (which is a rare case), do not start asking him questions to find out anything.
It would be unnecessary, since he is not conscious enough to concentrate his thoughts while sleeping.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech but not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful about interpreting what you hear and drawing any conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
It's not even a joke.
This caused a great deal of anxiety.
So the most important thing is that you don't worry, because this is just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally straight to Illhaeuser
After a long low-flying, the Illhaeuser team finally got a new lease of life and won again on home soil.
Although there was no match, the Yellow and Black were in a position to win several times.
The pace of the match was not too tense, as the attackers had difficulty finding the right rhythm.
The first shot at the gate was attempted by the captain of the visiting team, Kauffmann, but the away ball only touched the top corner of the gate wall. Then Illhaeuser prevailed and a series of shots followed: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot, then Hirn's shot went over the gate. Romain spiccel and Diebold also tried with a remote attempt to shake the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other side, the players were clustered in a block defending the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in the shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first in position at the side of Dannemarie. Immediately afterwards, the first goal was scored: after Diebold's first shot, the ball was kicked out by Marais of Illhaeuserni with an excellent position and then sent it to the goal (53 minutes).
However, the Illhauser goal scorer did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight in reverse.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of the fact that they did not cause much trouble to the home team, who only pulled back a little to strengthen their defence, only to retain some excitement in the final seconds when, after a great struggle, the ball came very close to the goal.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration by fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports, so the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The visit coincides with the meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by fishermen in Britain to take action against the rise in the price of gas oil, which has exceeded the record average price of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to David Martinon, spokesman for the President of the Republic, the President "will discuss with fishermen how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make sailor working conditions and wages safer".
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic demonstrations were held in the provinces of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 kilometres of traffic jams.
They also paralyzed traffic at the Quiberon marina, but the roads leading to Belle-Île were not blocked.
They've put roadblocks on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by lighting tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest, while demonstrations were also held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports along the Atlantic coast and in the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishermen refused to board, and Le Havre, where some 20 ships obstructed the traffic of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique district have lifted the blockade of the massive Total oil refinery in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the other hand, decided to wait for the next steps to be decided at the meeting of the Ministry on Wednesday.
In Le Guilvinec, the 'crisis committee' is due to decide on Tuesday on its next step and its participation in a meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some fishermen in Brittany do not want their interests represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "the fishermen are not giving in to their demands" and "they are not going to Paris", declared Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay tax on gas oil currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the only way to make a ship profitable is if the price of gas oil falls below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" has died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83 after a battle with cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid their respects to the legendary actor and philanthropist, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its delivery plans for 2008
Despite the threat of a global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, can keep up with plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company's president.
In the first six months, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is highly dependent on the Chinese market, in particular for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers over the past eight years.
More than 15% of AIG's assets to be sold
The American International Group, an insurance company backed by U.S. financial authorities, is willing to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back $85 billion in arrears, reports the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension business, AIG would divest itself of most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
According to the Times, AIG's board of directors met on Sunday night to discuss the possibility of a sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets AIG intends to sell include its aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, no final decision has been made on the sale.
AIG needs to get liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, and by doing so, it risks losing as much as 80% of its capital and its shareholders in proportion.
The Paris Historique study of the historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic drop on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bailout plan, the Dow Jones fell 6.98 percent (an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points), and the Nasdaq fell 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged by 777.68 points to close at 10 365.45 points.
The largest decline in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technology securities, closed down by 199,61 points, down by 1 983,73 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Extended Index declined by 8,81% (or 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points, according to the official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was weak at the opening, and then, when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bailout plan to restore market equilibrium, it went into a deep dive.
The House of Commons voted 228 to 205 to reject the funding requested by Henry Paulson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The plan was voted down by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
"This has filtered out the market for bad signals, as it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan", says Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was expecting this plan", he added, expressing concern that if such a plan was adopted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really doomed . . . , it will be up to the Fed and other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will continue to tighten", warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds, "every day more and more financial institutions fail" in the United States.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated suddenly, necessitating emergency measures to bail out banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the market is "not just in a crisis in the United States, but in a crisis worldwide", adds an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has been significantly revitalized.
The yield on the 10-year government bond fell from 3,827% to 3,632% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old's fell from 4,357% to 4,161% the day before.
Obama won the first televised debate
The first debate between the two American presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would come out of the debate as the winner.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaigners claimed victory in a televised debate watched by a third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen says that although John McCain's actions were respectable, they were not "impressive" enough to stop his declining popularity, as evidenced by polls taken five weeks before the presidential election.
According to Gallup, the Democratic candidate is the strongest contender: the poll results released Saturday show Obama ahead of McCain by five points (44% and 49%).
Among the most prominent, undecided voters, 39 percent of those polled said Obama would win, while 25 percent expected McCain to win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further increase his lead with a promising performance by his running mate, Joseph Biden, on Thursday, in his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned over the weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
She has good instincts".
McCain, now in his seventies, never fails to highlight his own undoubtedly vast foreign policy experience, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were central to their first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... was the slogan repeatedly used in the attack.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", McCain said.
This is the main attack surface used by the Republican TV commercials running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was concise and precise.
He emphasized that he could make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, Obama already does", said the Democratic advert aired over the weekend, which blamed the Republican leader for still failing to measure the impact of the crisis on America's "street people".
"In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you", Obama told 20,000 people gathered in rainy North Carolina for the rally.
The financial turmoil is undoubtedly in favor of Obama, who Americans consider to be the best fit to save the economy from collapse.
"The future may prove to be a seven-point turn", said Senator Charles Schumer, the influential Democrat.
Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat and a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had "the same excellent economic instincts" as Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reiterated that despite the stock market fluctuations, he will be able to reduce the tax burden for 95% of Americans, adding that his primary goals include creating the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank bailout plan, which was passed by Congress last night, and was extremely unpopular.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition protesters marched on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the expected result of the parliamentary elections.
After polling stations closed on Sunday night, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been released, many young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: "Mr. Dictator, resign!"
"Why should I have gone, they're doing whatever they want with my vote!" says one youth.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to present itself in a good light to foreign observers in order to establish relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the election was deemed fair by the observers, the country could be relieved of the sanctions that have denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
The opposition, however, said the election was not clean.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers could not participate in the vote counting", lamented Yuri Potyemkin, spokesman for the highly heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition, which was organized from 12 parties.
"The changes were only nominal", emphasizes Aleksandar Milinkievich, the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive.
If the opposition's delegates get into parliament, it means they've been appointed, not elected.
But getting into parliament allows them to sit on television, sit in the regions of the country and introduce bills.
The opposition must therefore enter political life, because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we are unable to recover, we risk falling under Russian domination.
We want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the election process, will accept the result of the vote.
They stress that the turnout seems too high and that the large-scale organisation of the early voting (in which 26% of voters in Minsk participated) has allowed for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks Social Democratic leader Aleksandar Kozulin, who was released as the second-to-last political prisoner from prison in August.
No one was in the voting booths.
Parliament will be made up of up to five opposition members, those who are most suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night once again covers the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are celebrating their success.
Blood is safe again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary, and President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, as Héma-Québec has now become one of the safest and most efficient blood donation societies in the world.
Most important, he regained the trust of the people, which had been shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
As is well known, the national blood supply treated by the Canadian Red Cross was infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980's.
After the tragedy and the general uproar, the Government of Canada, led by Justice Horace Krever, launched a formal investigation in February 1994 to shed light on the circumstances leading up to the tragedy and to formulate recommendations for avoiding future similar cases.
While Justice Krever was late in submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committees to design a new blood system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Commission has fulfilled this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports have led to the creation of two blood supply services in Canada: one, Héma-Québec, which serves Quebec, and the other, the Canadian Blood Supply Company, which serves all the other provinces and two territories.
"When Héma-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38 percent of the people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years that followed, however, improvements in the safety of blood products and our work in the field helped us to regain people's trust". Décary is proud to report that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the Québec population had trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Héma-Québec has been operating on a precautionary basis since its creation on 28 September 1998.
During this period, several cases of human infection with the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, known as rubella, were discovered in Europe, says the doctor who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was transmitted through blood.
So we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that if we're unsure, and there's a risk of serious disease, we should use exclusionary measures, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain damage and inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was determined beyond a doubt that the disease is also transmitted through the blood.
This case convinced us that the precautionary principle made sense".
In 1999, a technique that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus came onto the market, the nucleic acid assay (NAT), which can detect the virus directly in the blood of donors, rather than the antibodies to the virus that previously used assays were based on.
"The NAT test has shortened the window period from infection to detection in the blood using our technical tools", explains the expert.
This period was reduced to less than a week.
This significantly reduced the risk of blood donors unknowingly contaminating the blood supply and making it undetectable.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
"In other words, we would have to distribute 12 million blood products to someone who is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for one such case to occur and for someone to become infected with the HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, says Héma-Québec's number one executive.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You never know what new pathogens are going to enter your system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the bloodstream through insect bites.
Therefore, we must be on alert at all times", continued Dr Décary, stressing that in addition to the slaughter reserves, Héma-Québec must ensure that there is a sufficient permanent reserve.
"As the population ages, so do the needs.
As cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the blood donor population, with only 3% of the population of Quebec eligible to donate blood.
However, any healthy person at least 18 years of age who is eligible may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On the average, 14 percent of applicants will not accept blood because they have AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is rampant are not eligible to donate for a year.
"This 3 percent is enough to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we run out of supplies.
But we need to increase the number of blood donors as the existing ones get older, because they can't give blood after a while.
But it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, and even more difficult to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's fast-paced world, one hardly has a single hour to go and donate blood".
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only supplies blood products but also human tissues, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively in the treatment of severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen and then deposited at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously treated as medical waste, can be used to produce blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the arrival of our 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample a few weeks ago, and we plan to collect over 1,000 new samples each year.
We will probably start offering these for transplantation early next year", explains Dr. Décary, who says that the umbilical cord blood collection program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are sad that they cannot afford to do this" - indeed, Héma-Québec cannot afford to make this complex and costly program available in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the play-offs
The Montreal Impact defeated the Seattle Sounder 3-1 in the USL-1 qualifier yesterday, and advanced to the quarterfinals with a combined score of 4-3, in their second quarterfinal and the final game of the season, which was played at the Saputo Stadium.
The decisive goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half went goalless, in the second half, the Montreal team's two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also hit the opponent's net.
Only Roger Levesque of the Sounders team has managed to knock out Matt Jordan.
Recall that in their first game on Friday, Impact suffered a 2-1 loss to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact are playing the Vancouver Whitecaps in the playoffs.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder, who lost the first game 3-1, beat the Whitecaps 4-3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the semifinals with a combined score of 5-4.
The Impact are scheduled to play the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the games will be announced later today.
In the second leg - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triad is ready for another season.
The triple-A team of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the way with a great offense, and finally the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers 3-2 in a penalty shootout last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored one goal, Plekanec two, and Kovalev one, which was the fourth victory of the team in six qualifying matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet", warns the Russian player.
"I need one more game to feel really fit".
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first quarter", noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the result of the game.
He got a huge ovation".
Charest's Northern Attempts
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will start this year
Shortly after the Liberal Party's meeting, Jean Charest traveled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is poised to win the midterm elections scheduled for today.
"Strict our last great northern frontier" is the ambitious long-term goal set by Jean Charest at the Liberal Party's rally in Lévis, Quebec, yesterday.
During his lecture, behind his back, they were projecting a series of images similar to "Moulin à images".
The three giant projectors were taking one stunning shot at a time: hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
These spectacular devices are used during election season.
The Prime Minister, however, refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" for the future of Québec, which is embodied in a "new economic area", including a labour agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement and several planned agreements with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49° latitude) has been a frequent feature of speeches by the Prime Minister, but he has never given a lecture on the subject.
The head of state, however, confined himself to explaining why he considers the North "a treasure trove of enormous potential", but did not mention the timing, investment amounts or a specific order of priority for future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: in particular, hydropower, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of the countries in lockdown and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The north is home to "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", says Charest.
This territory, "twice the size of France", is our territory, Quebec.
It is not only with us, but within us", the head of state repeated, stressing that he wants to create a national founding myth.
He stressed that the development of Quebec was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the planning of Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a break from the stage to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed, the premier said at a news conference.
"This is our historic position, reaffirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the Government.'
On the other hand, "in the face of climate change, we must rethink our view of the North", said the prime minister, referring to the Northwest Passage, which opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the Prime Minister's view, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
What about the natives, the Indians, the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister stated that the Québec government is paying special attention to them and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially to young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later a delegate from the Parti Québécois in Unguai), have already started the consultation with some 30 local communities.
An inter-ministerial committee, headed by Benoît Pelletier, also started its work, with Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) playing an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision is created".
The development of the North would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematic and environmentally friendly", the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals of the past, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend which began with a big cocktail party on Friday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power station be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"Politicians in our party, including Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who led the Quiet Revolution and the nationwide expansion of hydroelectric power, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another, true, conservative work, namely John Diefenbaker's programme "Roads to the North", which was the programme of the Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, President Charest stressed that the start-up is planned for 2012.
"Keep it between us, but I plan to be there", he told his followers, and his statement was met with a roar of applause.
The Prime Minister, who in April said that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote in the autumn of this year, which the law allows him to do.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was already full, having taken on duties at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend party convention proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal president to discuss the nationalist resolutions, which were passed almost without thinking, especially the "constitutional aspirations" that the Liberal Party demands, in particular, recognition of "Quebec's peculiar character" in the Constitution.
I also want Quebec to appoint the members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, and I want those members to have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, however, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, re-launched the Northern Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, "we would have been much further ahead today", said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who stood as a candidate in the Jean-Talon vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"We want this to be more than a show", said Sébastien Proulx, the party leader who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his leave today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Vic Toews, Harper's cabinet minister (who happens to be the "Justice" minister) had the audacity last summer to call Louise Arbourt a "disgrace" to Canada.
To insult a woman who has fought tirelessly for the truth and deserves our admiration, says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, which is the only Western country that has not returned its own citizens from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is a government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the alleged crimes.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, has refused to do so and let a child soldier languish in inhumane conditions.
The only government that puppets justice while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also calling for Omar Khadr to be returned to Canada so that he can have a fair trial.
And our government is turning a blind eye to torture: it doesn't care that a young adult is already completely ruined, and that years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we don't realize it yet, our rights, our freedom, and our democracy are being subtly destroyed. "Democracy": Harper repeats this word over and over again, which sounds like a mere empty word from her mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality: any Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned at the discretion of a leader of a government that has been in the minority (and what will happen after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies virtue, law and order, but they fail to see that this government is trampling on the values that have given our country its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, shame is this - don't look elsewhere.
Opinion - Barrick Gold's speech at the Orwell
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter appeared from Patrick J. Garver, the vice president and CEO of Barrick Gold in Canada.
Following Orwell's analysis, Garver states that the world's largest gold mining company has filed a $6 million defamation suit against three authors and a small-time publisher to initiate what he calls a "public dispute".
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions - especially in defamation cases - are based, not on the truth, but on the law.
It's no surprise that Garver was silent about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate, to ruin anyone who disagrees with him?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to defend and fight an unequal battle, with the other side having an army of lawyers backed by the almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal fight, however, the tactic of ruining the defendant and making a friendly agreement is often employed, not only to silence the opponents but also to intimidate those who would try to reenter the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they should have spoken out publicly.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is done differently, in Canada the parties to the dispute do not usually beat each other, but rather express their thoughts.
So all the mine would have done was open up its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the issue.
But it seems Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public and is making a move to erase petitions and letters written to defend the writers of Noir Canada.
Mr. Garver, could you explain how you can initiate a "public" debate while ignoring the opinion of this public?
In the Vice President's mind, that word probably means just the well-paid lawyers, not the entire population of Canada, and that narrows the meaning of the word a lot.
In a democratic state, even those who insult others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public support for the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is primarily because it condemns the mining industry's harsh practices.
The public is willing to hear Barrick and pass judgment, but on the basis of civilized reasoning rather than a lawsuit that many would prefer to silence. (In relation to the term "public debate", by the way, Barrick Gold recently wrote to Noir Canada's authors to refrain from using this term.)
Beyond Garver's surrealist arguments, the Barrick Gold process is an open assault on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, which are the building blocks of any democratic society.
The procedure as a whole denies the right to cite credible sources, to debate some of the facts and their interpretations, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss subjects that are not of interest to the rich corporations of today, with the burden of litigation, who will have the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it should do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada have adopted.
You have the right to answer.
We have long been able to deal with debate, disagreement and conflict in our academic circles.
Barrick Gold's reckless conduct shows that, contrary to what it claims, it is reluctant to engage in open debate.
This is a loss for both the academic world and the Canadian public debate establishment, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
The Wall Street bailout, the Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, Republican and Democrat, finally reached agreement yesterday on an economic bailout, the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main elements of the plan are: more effective control by the representatives of the implementation; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money earmarked; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized for non-payment at a level; access to the salaries of the managers of the companies receiving aid.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the U.S. House Nancy Pelosi, and Judd Gregg, the Republican congressman who was in the hearing yesterday, announced the good news minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon trial ended.
"We've made great strides toward a solution that will work effectively in the markets", said Henry Paulson, a representative in the Bush administration.
"We did it all to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis that is plaguing Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"The most important consideration is that if we don't do this, there will be tremendous shock, chaos and disorder in the daily lives of Americans", said Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.Y.
The negotiations have been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investor sentiment.
They've given you a deadline for the deal until the stock market opens this morning.
Two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed a willingness to agree, but expressed displeasure at the escalation to extremes.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited himself with expanding the agreement with elements such as provisions on homeownership preservation or paying the directors of state-aided companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other people's irresponsibility, it's not a very pleasant thing.
But these steps are necessary", he noted on an American television program.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope so".
"From what I have read in bold, it is clear that this is something we all need to digest and move on from.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan would use taxpayer money to buy the dubious claims of American financial institutions, somewhat risky, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the real estate bubble, which led first to the collapse of risky mortgages (secondary mortgages), then to other debt-bearing (commercial) securities, and finally to the freezing of liquidity and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was defeated by a group of Republican lawmakers last week.
It seems we've managed to get out of this impasse since the Democrats agreed to let the government provide certain "toxic" assets to troubled companies rather than buy them.
To satisfy all members of Congress, the plan included a provision that if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could impose new taxes to recoup its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion installment would be paid first, followed by another $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by a second vote of Congress.
In return for the help, Washington will acquire a stake in the subsidiaries, which will give it a dividend on the profits, which it can sell after the crisis subsides.
The Federal Government will have the option of delaying the foreclosure of the properties used to cover the mortgages covered by the plan and will be able to set the maximum amount of salary and compensation payable to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan's developers want the plan voted on today by the House and Wednesday by the Senate.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still uncertain that the plan will be approved.
Because yesterday, there were repeated statements against the plan from both Republicans and Democrats.
"It's clear that Washington is not going to hear your voice", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But none that would benefit the taxpayers".
Brad Sherman, the Democratic congressman who leads a small congressional group called the "skeptical faction", presents the situation differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred leading economists, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us asking Congress to take it easy and to consider carefully what course it is taking", Sherman declared yesterday.
Europe was at that moment again aware that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux States announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11,2 billion (US$ 16,3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments was necessary after France's BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its near-bankrupt competitor after losing EUR 2 million (US$ 2,9 billion) in the secondary mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurance companies, with 85,000 employees.
"This is not wasted money", said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is precisely what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government appears to be preparing to nationalize another bank, which has been beset by financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of the outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which the mortgage loan is worth 41 billion pounds ($75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they will be acquiring the subsidiaries and client base of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the actor
His beautiful blue eyes were considered by some to be his greatest punching card, by others his greatest weakness.
Did the charming, smiling American actor ever get rid of his narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
Shyness, sensitivity and innate talent also kept him away from the silky style that is the very essence of the great monsters of the art world.
But what a great run he's had!
Paul Newman, one of the last icons of the golden age of American cinema, died of lung cancer at his Connecticut estate on Friday, aged 83.
He was less of a monumental personality than Brando, who had long been a rival to him on the big screen, more reserved in his characters and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also preached freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Blood mixing often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German-Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots have contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only enhanced his merit.
He was the embodiment of a country that was passionate about the ideals of the self-made man and the warrior ideals of the Pacific war. He studied drama at Yale University in the early 1950s, then at the Actor's Studio in New York before exploring the world of theater, television and, soon after, film.
In addition to being a civil rights activist, he was a race car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and was regarded as a sex symbol, despite having been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know what the shadows were of this mysterious, reclusive, self-absorbed actor who hated the glitter of show business.
He was an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman this weekend has shocked movie fans, with his big roles now only on the black screen of memories.
A look at his life's work, and we'll see the seventh American art, cinema, in continuous change for over fifty years.
Our memories are intertwined with the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and the young man who is running away from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in the Tennessee Williams adaptation of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958.
In recent times (1990) he is remembered as the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age when his marriage has not lived up to his expectations.
We've seen a lot of other faces of Paul Newman in his films.
Robert Wise's memorable performance as the stormy-living boxer Rocky Graziano in "Someone Up There" was originally intended for James Dean and was taken over after his death, launching Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant production of "The Big Trouble", which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
He played a bitter, vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's brilliant film The Swindler (1961) and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, for which he received his only Academy Award nomination in 1987 out of nine nominations.
Times change, but the same face: that was him.
It's always been like this.
His career was marked by a change of era.
Younger viewers are most familiar with George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an ice hockey team working with less conventional methods.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Great Leap Forward" in 1994.
The series was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition, in which he last appeared as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the film industry relatively early, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood for its glitz, glamour and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it "a living denial of underplay", saying that his play was too powerful.
But the business has not always been kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time has been a film-maker.
Yet he rarely played young and successful characters: rather, he played figures from the fringes of society - the nervous, the alcoholic, the malicious or the hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he could reproduce with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a man who was deeply sensitive and sensitive.
In the 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (adapted from the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), he portrayed a melancholy woman with his wife, Joanne Woodward.
The 1984 film "Harry and Son", a film of restraint and sadness, is a tribute to his son, Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's countless admirers remembered the actor, with his close friend and longtime comrade Robert Redford (who starred with him in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") mourning, stating, "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor, who we have now lost.
His legendary career is overshadowed by his fight for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking, and his comments criticizing Hollywood's excesses.
We've seen her smile on the wrappers of sauces, sauces, cookies and other foods, and she's got a pretty bad face, even though she thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to the foundation set up for sick children.
Newman never sat on his back: he remained committed to his profession all his life.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father was always and forever incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege to be here".
It's been a privilege to be able to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, after all.
What do you produce at the Zuschlag & Tsai accounting factory?
Soon, on October 8th, the trial of the criminal case against John Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of committing fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, which are particularly harmful, are committed in a continuous and commercial manner in a criminal organization.
The prosecutor's office said that the money won was used for their own purposes, and that the tasks were often completed with false invoices.
The state and municipal money - a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the cash register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of certain individuals.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the tender money won was taken on the basis of cost accounts which did not have actual performance behind them and the associations never fulfilled the undertaking.
The indictment says most of the bills were forged.
The bills were purchased at the market in Johannesburg and the stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And to which companies the account was made, among others, on the Balaton-Regional Tour, where Zuschlag János sent Lados István.
According to his last statement, he had to look at boarding houses and restaurants.
The Commission requested an invoice for its consumption there, which was used to prepare the invoices to be submitted to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Social and Labour Portfolio and the Metropolitan Municipality for applications, among others.
Most of these were written by István Lados with his partner, András Guard, who, according to our information, wrote the reports most needed to obtain the subsidies.
One of the highlights of Lados' "study tour" was a brewery.
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlages in 2003, the catering establishment provided meals for a group of 90 persons belonging to the Segur Pont Association.
However, the manager claimed that this number would not have been able to enter the reception hall at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation for a Better Future - later called Together for the Third Millennium - was rife with errors of form and content.
One Bed-and-breakfast in Badaxnytomaji had only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it for one night, yet the bill was for 130 guests.
But the fancy forms were too much when they marked Pigal Ltd., which also deals in hospitality, whose books, according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office, did not include documents for Better Future and Hoppá.
The company's head, Wolf Victor told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and shown bills, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The stamp had our business name and tax number in the wrong place".
He added that, beyond the formal reasons, it was not true that according to the bill, they had accommodated 100 people, because they have a total of eleven rooms that do not have that much space.
Plus, the bill was for catering, when their restaurant is long out of business.
The enthusiastic account-makers did not even investigate the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked at only organised foreign trips, so they stumbled upon the fact that they marked a trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not in line with the company's account issuance practice.
In addition, as the investigation showed, VAT was included in the document, whereas the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the level of VAT was incorrect in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Better Future, as the company's services were not charged by the indicated 25 percent VAT, but by 15 percent, and the hotel employees only issued a machine bill, while the bill was handmade.
Moreover, the 'exhibitors' have also misled the company by designating road transport as an activity carried out, as revealed by the prosecution, which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on investment advice.
In addition, due to formal differences - incorrect invoice format, not true stamps - the invoices of the Together Third Millennium Foundation, the XXI Century Cultural Association and the Sigur Pont were also false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfeheltó Sport Camp, whose representatives denied that they issued the bills.
The counterfeiters also failed to take into account, for example, that HIB Kft. in Nyregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the Association for Young Towns group dined there, which is why the company's liquidation officer, as far as we know, denied that he had issued the paper.
They were deliberately exposed
The other group of issuers of accounts is those who were aware that they would have to issue a dummy account.
The Budapest Foundation for Opportunity, at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, issued a bill for the Third Millennium Foundation together, for about four million forints.
The head of Collab Ltd. was, according to the indictment, persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue a fictitious bill.
In addition, Zuschlagek cooperated with Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, and which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red-Horn Association with accounts worth roughly HUF 5 million, which were not backed by any real economic activity.
No money was moved because the accounts were then torn down, but the organizations had forgotten to include it in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing invoices are those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Ivan Kubatov was the delivery agent for the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio Ltd, which is based in Budapest but is not located there, and which deals in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company also issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhala, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The company was run by a Romanian man to whom Ivan Kubatov also allegedly passed on the company's documents between 2002 and 2005.
We know that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued a bill on behalf of the company to Atlas, Hope and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, and that he took their counter-bills.
Specifically, at the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
But none of the firms actually worked, which the defendant said was because they had not been employed.
However, he benefited the companies by issuing invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation, at the request of his co-defendant, the lawyer Szente Zsolt, who also prepared the company's founding documents.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov issued a total of 15 accounts to the organizations, worth HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10 percent of the amount on the invoices and the VAT hit the Kubatov mark.
He even used the Si-Beri Bt to display fictitious bills, which were produced for the Segur Pont competition.
Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted a tender to the public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), in January 2006.
They won 500-500 thousand forints, but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To keep this from being revealed, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Ltd were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found during a search of Kemecsei Árpád's office at the education department.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecution, will probably give an account of the proceedings.
The most interesting thing is that you, the prime accused, John Zuschlag, decide to turn the whole thing upside down.
Your testimony is not very detailed, and although you have promised many times to speak comprehensively, you have not done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, perhaps in return for the most of the damage, 50 million forints, the socialists made a deal with him, and Zusi takes the trouble.
By now, he may have been offended, as his requests to ease his detention conditions, that is, to place him under house arrest, have been continuously ignored.
While the perpetrators of far more damaging and irreversible economic crimes can walk free or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he has no choice.
The psychology of over-bid: why are we giving out more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuroeconomic basis for this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been revealed by researchers at New York University, who are neuroscientists and economists.
Their study, published in the journal Science, found that people who don't want to fall behind in a type of competition, such as an eBay auction, are more likely to pay too high a price.
The research was trying to map out the neural patterns of this "play" by experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in a lottery, the other in a playful auction, while the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the other party is the main player, the striatum, a complex of the subclavian artery, is activated when the game is lost.
This brain region, among other functions, is involved in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, the researchers believe that the price increase can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists in the research team also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this case, three groups bid against one partner in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made their bets.
Another group was promised that if they won the game and left, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
The third group, on the other hand, had just received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost that money in a losing auction.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that one group was emphasized on winning and the other on losing.
But proving the neuroscientists' hypothesis, the members of the "against-loss" team were willing to bet higher than the control and the "win" groups.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
They have hitherto only explained the phenomena of auctions with the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging has helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so that we have now come to a third explanation", states Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When Should You See a Doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people are chronically infected with hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
You can count on hundreds of thousands of hepatitis cases here, but you only treat seven thousand, because patients often don't know they're infected.
Hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
They have many similarities in their symptoms, including hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e. g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sputum, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should be vaccinated against A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, usually accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After this, yellowing of the skin and the white of the eye, light faeces, and dark urine may occur, and healing may take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, one million people die each year from the more serious form of the disease, hepatitis B, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected persons receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences, leading to liver failure and liver cancer if left untreated.
Most infected people do not know they have the disease because the virus subtly destroys liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 or 30 years later.
So then it's very important to have early prevention, to have regular screening.
Three groups have much higher rates than the average: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooers.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus worldwide is now estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is advisable to consult your GP if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
If the disease is detected early, it can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, and the infectious process can be stopped and cancer can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first celebrated in 2004 by patient organizations around the world.
It aims to raise awareness of chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection.
Does believing in God hurt less?
A recent study suggests that religious faith acts as a kind of pain reliever, which may have eased the deaths of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to study how belief in God affects people's perception of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and as many atheists were given electric shocks while they were all studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the technology of scanning the human brain, it was also found that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a series of studies involving academics as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a spark device to the left hand of the subject, which provided the electric shock.
The researchers asked participants to look intently at two paintings, the 17th-century Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century painting Lady with Hermeline.
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a religious mood among the faithful, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the others and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive sessions, while either viewing the religious-themed or the general image.
Catholics reported that during the vision of the Virgin Mary they felt "safe", "cared for", and "rested, filled with peace".
When viewing a religious image, they reported 12 percent less pain than when viewing Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who participated in the study, believes that you can achieve a similar effect with any powerful image, even with atheists, just by finding the right photo.
"We should find an image that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should, and in many cases does, change our personality", Wright added.
After all the great results, the question is, if you show people a picture of the Madonna by Leonardo, or by a similar painter, how would that affect their pain management?
Would a quality Virgin Mary view mean even better results?
You are what you share
On your 10th birthday, Google can tell you that you have as much in your pocket as the sky above your head, where you've been on vacation, what you've done, what you're interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top people.
But for those skeptics who see parallels to the Orwellian nightmare, they don't see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's ultimate goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, which is necessary to keep up with the original goal of the founders of Google, which was to "get all the information in the world into a system".
The spokesman for Google said that after 10 years of world-shaking work, the company is still in the early stages of managing all the information.
When asked what happens in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like, "What am I going to do tomorrow?" or "What kind of job would I really be?" But until then, software can't answer these seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about the user.
Not all internet users are aware that search terms are recorded precisely when searching the internet, the IP address from which they were searched and the page from which they left after searching.
For example, Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own browsing history, look back at what they searched for, what they clicked on, and in the long run, generate much more personalized results for them - the same logic that will be used in Recommendations, where the system recommends products and services to us based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if my data is used against me, if they see what I do? ask users who are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, it's the potential power of the company that's the scarecrow, not the guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, even the rebellion against power that triggers the backlash from the netizens.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only recorded but can be transferred to third parties where justified, and that in such legal cases there is no protection of the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most notorious example of this in recent times was the coordinated crackdown on Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with identifying information about pedophiles from its social networking site, Orkut.
Privacy-conscious netizens, however, were able to raise their voices in May when the company, in partnership with the electronic rights group EFF, successfully argued in court against the FBI that Google could no longer be compelled by any provision of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought off some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, which it had won by citing the reauthorization of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but failed to obtain individual user search lists or a complete two-month list of websites and keywords.)
So Google's judgment is quite controversial: it's being lashed out at by those who are afraid to give their personal data because they feel their privacy and privacy is being compromised by starting to use Google services and by rebelling against the multicultural companies that glow in the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its drive to bring together enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users in many countries sees the next generation of big companies as a "growing corporation" as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which is set to take over the world with Windows, no matter how hard it is to fight for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google doesn't ask users for an ID, doesn't charge for their applications, and the open, free, constantly updated source code and software package makes it look much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software giant's practice.
But it could also be that geeks are clearly seeing the very problematic relationship between privacy and the Internet, which is exactly what one of the most talked about keywords of the last few years, Web 2.0, has brought about.
Because Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving a trail behind and using the channels of communication we have, and while the scale of those channels varies from individual to individual, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
The average teenager can have a profile on multiple social media sites, from Facebook to Xangá, linking them to other services like Twitter, or to last.fm, which lists their music habits, and then linking them to tracking systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, or running a blog that automatically shows up their latest photo galleries, which they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While there are many examples of how a girlfriend can easily tell from the morning photo stream of their mutual circle of friends who her cheating boyfriend spent the evening with, or how she can fire an employee just because he writes his honest opinion on top management on her blog, I'm sure the concept of privacy has been completely reevaluated by now.
Living online is about what you show yourself, and that's the basic premise behind the behavior of today's young people.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid the Google monopoly, can do it (starting with, for example, Scroogle, which uses Google's search engine but also intentionally leaves no trace).
For example, there are a lot of people who deliberately don't sign up for social networks so that they can't be found, and Google's online apps, from word processors to image managers to newsreaders, can be replaced by alternative versions that don't connect to huge server parks and don't make us the best profile ever.
The public isn't exactly waiting in the wings for Google to show you the protein in your teeth.
At $156 billion today, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad interfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the accelerating pace of services introduced is causing severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critics, however, find that these have some disturbing counterparts: for example, the top management has flatly rejected the employees' protest after doubling the company's childcare fee, the management has found it too expensive to feed the employees as many times as they like per day, but all this is overshadowed by the fact that Google back in 2006 stood up to the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company filters any findings that offend good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they don't announce a new service in advance until it's ready to go, but it's certain that the problems that are likely to arise in the coming months and years will move the world to a new level: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project has reached the point where the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear the health system, where we can build a complete health profile based on our previous findings, our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database could provide a good foundation for the next generation of science fiction writers, as the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, Scroogled, describes in a point-and-click Orwellian manner a future in which a human can only be approached with alarming accuracy from Google's data.
Two teenagers helped the double murderer from Oz in the manhunt.
Two teenagers were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, and they were assisted in the suppression of the traces of the crime, according to the suspicion, said the spokesman of the Borsod County Police Headquarters on Tuesday.
The youths have confessed to the crime, and are currently charged with conspiracy.
The two teenagers, two girls, according to MTI, are on the loose.
A plea deal can carry a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder in Odz, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
You're suspected of premeditated, profit-driven, multiple homicide.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so he tricked his creditor into a former facility last Wednesday, where he killed her and his 9-year-old daughter.
MTI has information that the young man was prepared to commit the crime, and that is indicated by the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to acquire the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million, or about CZK 5 billion, for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from the list of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
The Polish State holds 99% of the shares, which intends to sell more than 60% of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 has learned that the Polish bid represents the highest amount ever offered by the interested parties for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech press, the bids have so far been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts at 5 to 10 billion crowns.
The shareholders' agreement would allow the sale of around 90% of the shares.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of around 25%, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis from the European press
In Tuesday's comments on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already referring to "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster is the fault of the American president, La Repubblica of Rome blames, who was not even able to list his own party behind the recently drafted bill aimed at remedying the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett has mentioned, it's more appropriate to talk about the second September 11.
Some of the Madrid press is also seeing the guilt in Washington.
El Mundo believes that the lack of political leadership there has brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the entire world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but the congressional vote has threatened the possibility that Washington will not offer a political tool to manage the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still provide bailouts to failing financial institutions, and they can use taxpayers' money to save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither funds nor more surprises will be enough.
In the long term, the EU Member States need to overcome their national egoism and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
More than 100 billion euros were given to failing financial institutions on Monday alone, warns Vienna's Der Standard, which says that concerns are growing that European taxpayers, like Americans, will have to go deep in their pockets to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" don't have to be throwing in hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be nice to record which cases it makes sense to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The intelligent car mimics the flight of a dune
What better way to develop collision avoidance technology than by mimicking the obstacle sensors found in the natural world?
Like the bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C bio-replicated car robot control system, a robotic mini car that has been endowed with bee-like properties, with the ultimate goal of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
Each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space while flying, which is actually very similar to our safety casing", explained Kazuhhiro Doi, brand director of technology PR and research development at the exhibition.
It is important for the complex eye of the bee, which can see in all directions at angles of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate the complex function of the eye, engineers came up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
This detects obstacles within 2 metres of the 180-degree field of view in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
In a split second, the robot detects the obstacle and, by mimicking the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels as far as necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this evasive maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"Without this, the car-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It should react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shields, a layer within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot be upward, downward or transverse, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the invertibility of the wheels.
Instead of the infinite opportunity for bees to avoid other bees, the robot was used to rotate and accelerate and slow down.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh says that what's important is the instinctive intelligent response, not the ability to process data, much less to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
You don't need to store them, and you react with intuitive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so you're only using a few dozen kilobytes of memory all the time.
You don't need gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be available in series production cars within 10 years.
Further applications may include the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the car to its intended destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
The child with the poison has a name
A draft version of the $700 billion economic bailout bill to buy bad loans from banks has been prepared.
They'll spend half the money in the first round.
In further talks that lasted until Saturday after midnight Eastern time, congressional leaders reached a compromise in the days-long debate over a $700 billion bailout, Reuters reported.
We've made some serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said that all that's left is to get the deal on paper.
The compromise resulting from the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done, and Pelosi said it's not about saving Wall Street, it's about turning the wheel of the economy.
The package was released in writing before the Asian markets opened at 8 p.m. on Sunday (i.e. 2 a.m. on Monday, Central European time), but it did not cause a spectacular upturn on the stock market.
The bill, which is called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, will be voted on Monday in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, by the way, is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was that the $700 billion would be spent on one of the poor quality, credit-receivable securities.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent by using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes on the issue, which is expected to be on Monday, with the Treasury buying badly rated, credit-backed securities, and the fate of the next $100 billion hanging on the president's decision.
The program will be overseen by a special committee, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is still up for another vote by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can use a combination of tactics: it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, and other types of "poison" loans at the same time.
The purchase can be done through auctions and directly, the ministry officials said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the assets of concern, for which the companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the means to get up to $700 billion into the immediate needs of the American financial system, whether it's buying bad assets on a large scale, insuring them, or avoiding the systemic risk of one large financial institution collapsing.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law once it is signed, he added.
The heads of failing banks, on the other hand, can expect their exit money - simply called a golden parachute in overseas slang - to be limited by the government.
The limitation of payments is only applied in certain cases, and the limitations depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the department buys at auction, they'll put a surcharge on the gold parachute unless they send the levied bank manager to retirement.
When bad loans are purchased directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money is not overspent.
The picture is further enhanced by the fact that the existing gold parachute contracts are not changed, the restriction is only applied to new ones, in order to encourage participation in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that a law has restricted the compensation of CEOs", said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
In addition, the State acquires the right to acquire a stake in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, who can ultimately benefit from the transaction once the economy and the bailed-out bank are restored.
The bill provides that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress that provides for how to reimburse taxpayers for the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American people have asked us to do, which is not to protect taxpayer dollars", said Representative Darrell Issa of California.
Her Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, believed the measures were being pushed by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0,1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12,9% compared to August 2007, reports KSH.
Industrial export sales prices were 1,1% higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% compared to the same period a year earlier.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, the industrial producer prices were 0,7% higher than in the previous year and 3,2% higher than in the year prior.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only marginally, by 0,1% compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0,1% compared to July.
The highest price increase was recorded in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sectors (2,8%) mainly due to the monthly price increases of bags and leather goods production of 4,6% and footwear production of 2,5%.
The higher price level of plastics and chemicals has resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical, product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
The price decrease was recorded in the petroleum processing (1,4%) and electrical machinery and instrumentation manufacturing (0.9%) sectors, and to a minimal extent in the wood processing sector (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we recorded price increases of between 0,2% and 0,9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors, which account for a significant share of the domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0,3% in August, mainly as a result of the spillover effect of the official increase in gas prices implemented from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison, the oil processing sector recorded the largest increase in prices (32.4%) in terms of domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors.
The production of metal products increased by 13,2% and the food, beverage and tobacco production, which was the main sector, by 11%.
The decrease in prices was observed in the textile and textile manufacturing sectors (2,5%) and in the electrical machinery and instrument manufacturing sector (0,3%).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase ranged between 0,6% and 9,1%.
In the manufacturing sector as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors were 18.7% higher than a year earlier.
In August, domestic sales in the capital goods sectors showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) among the target groups of sectors.
The consumption goods sectors increased by 0,3%, while the energy and re-use sectors remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increases were observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16,8%) compared to the same month of the previous year.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 6.8%, while in the capital goods sector prices fell by 1.4%.
The export sales prices in the form of industrial forints increased by 1,1% in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3,9% in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro and 7.1% against the dollar in one month, and strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar in August 2007.
You don't need a visa to come to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement will come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before local Hungarian leaders.
He believes that "much now depends on the timely deployment of the electronic entry and control system overseas".
However, he pointed out that the new system would not include an entry permit, but tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomatic service is in Washington for talks.
He meets with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is presented with the Star by the Hungarian Republic's Central Cross of the Order of Merit, and holds discussions with Barack Obama's Democratic Party and Republican presidential candidate John McCain's foreign policy advisers.
The bailout is backed by Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both major US presidential candidates, pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are some politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon negotiations, congressional and administration officials announced at dawn Sunday that they had reached a deal in principle on a bailout package.
The Wall Street crash and the financial package to dissolve the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are both showing themselves to be better equipped than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls show that the economic issues have given Obama a slight edge, erasing the McCain lead he had after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's nomination for vice president.
Obama, at a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, expressed his hope that the $700 billion package would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection passages that he had supported.
"We must act now, responsibly . . . your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are in danger", he told the crowd of 35,000.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic ideas obsolete.
McCain told ABC that "we're all going to have a hard time swallowing this . . . but doing nothing is simply not the way to go".
The Republican senator said the bill included the creation of a committee to oversee the Treasury and limit the severance pay for top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no significant role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House is expected to vote on the bill by Monday.
The German-speaking area's memory
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp voters have become more self-conscious - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haider are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, in his article "Bavaria Revolution Eats Its Parents", he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The change of era is also a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was almost exactly ten years ago was likely to end: the end of the unquestioned hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU fell to 47.7%, the first time since the 1950s that it was below the 50% level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so in the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
This is due to the consistent modernization carried out by CSU in the province, which is eating up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in their pace, but it could not have been without consequences for voters' loyalty to the CSU, secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by increased opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp, voters have become more self-aware, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in recent weeks it is the classical bourgeois groups that have moved away from CSU the most: the self-employed, the industrialists, the graduates and the higher-educated.
The CSU's approval rating has dropped below 40 percent.
The French authorities have not yet been able to confirm the existence of the alleged infringement.
The article "Who, with whom? Party leaders on the backward coalition issue" in the conservative Vienna daily deals with the turbulent domestic political situation after the Austrian elections.
The PLO wishes to negotiate with the OPCW.
The PSC shall prohibit the SPO from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to all negotiations, the Greens are not ready to negotiate a coalition.
The election is over, everything now revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, party leaders barely let their cards through.
President Werner Faymann of the SPÖ confirmed his intention to negotiate with the PSE.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to have cooperation between the two parties - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current President of the ÖVP as well as Vice-Chancellor - was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer rate was voted down in any event.
This trend is not to be repeated.
Molterer was cautious about red offers.
As you said, it will certainly not be fruitful cooperation if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the OPCW.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party, the issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider of the BZÖ has repeatedly shown an open mind.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility", Haider said.
We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
The European Equal Opportunities Summit, which is being hosted by France, the EU's next presidency, has opened in Paris today.
In her message to the plenary, Járóka Lívia, MEP from Fides, as one of the key speakers at the conference, called for education segregation as one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low education, according to the press release of the Fidesz EP group.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality primary education, only a negligible proportion of them can obtain a higher education".
Járóka also stressed that as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
The MEPs also stressed the need to raise awareness of these links at the broadest level, including among Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; he contributes to the national budget through taxes paid on income and consumption.
"The Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education on the basis of their EU citizenship and the elimination of low-quality and segregated education", said Járóka Lívia.
The MEPs also called for the EU to take action to ensure that the EU's policies are implemented in a way that is consistent with the EU's policies.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunities offered by democracy to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", he said.
The European Equality Summit, which has been held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, in the context of the 'European Year for Equal Opportunities for All', aims to provide a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination set at European and Member State level.
CSU: Temporary clemency
At the end of October, they'll decide the fate of the disbanded Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the disgraceful election defeat, heads are not falling, the Bavarian CSU summit has postponed the discussion of personal issues for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party chairman and Günther Beckstein, provincial governor, may still remain in office, but the question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss, will be decided at an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized couple, however, felt that they were not clinging to their chairs with all their might.
This was done to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami", demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career, the Christian Social Union had 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has lost 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was "autonomous" in Bavaria, which contributed 18% of German GDP.
While the Conservatives continue to hold high in the key southern region for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced into a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a reorganization within the party, Horst Seehofer, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is also a possible successor to Huber, is also given a place in the narrow reconnaissance team that is starting to negotiate with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters, who are organized along the lines of right-wing values, about a possible government coalition in Munich.
It's a strange twist of fate that the list of Free Voters includes Gabriele Pauli, whose opposition to Stoiber was used as a coup by Huber-Beckstein, and then the ambitious local politician was treated with ruthlessness.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on trying to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will also be marked by the presence of Stoiber, who has been making headlines in the past, calling September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
Huber made some heated comments to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the Brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the country's 2005 success, is somehow re-established by a joint effort.
Merkel, who is hard pressed to hide her disappointment at the fiasco, says the CSU's loss of ground will not negatively impact the Berlin grand coalition.
Of course, this is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to manage, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD's 18.6 percent result was the weakest in Bavaria since 1946.
The score is 110-0.
No opposition lawmakers have entered the Belarusian parliament since the election on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country under the leadership of Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 10 million-strong country's legislative body has been without opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, united as the United Democratic Forces (UDF), had been hoping that the constitutional amendment would allow Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for a fourth time in the disputed 2006 election, to "allow" some opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODSO thus abandoned the boycott it had considered in advance.
The opposition's expectations were that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has taken a loan to reduce the ever-costly Russian natural gas imports and helped to transfer Beltransgaz, which owns the pipelines through the country, to Russia - would improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not allowed to travel because of the anti-democratic Belarusian political establishment.
He prefaced by indicating that the OSCE had eased its stance by focusing on positive developments rather than shortcomings, such as the fact that a third of opposition candidates were barred from running.
However, the OSCE's short report on Monday already criticised the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
However, the opposition says there is a marked improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia - which makes Belarus a federal state on paper - has been considering the two territories independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
The opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election said it was desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "the government was afraid of allowing even one opposition member into the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protests in light of the results, but is trying to get its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have many problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles in the way of their distribution, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly", Milinkevics said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as the main achievement, is not considered adequate even by the most officially supported pensioners.
- Due to the country's indebtedness, the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security system breaks down, which is "a grave silence", Milinkevics said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers described the election as democratic.
Sergey Lebegev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that "people believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work".
In a unique way in the history of Chigi Palace, revolving doors were installed to allow workers to enter and exit.
Starting today, this new measure is going into effect against the craftsmen, to screen out those who block and then go out for a coffee during business hours.
The anti-diary news was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The revolving doors", said Brunetta, "are about better and more efficient work, reducing the number of missing people and increasing the number of services".
"A new era of accountability and transparency is upon us.
This is the real reform", Brunetta stressed.
The Chigi Palace will complete the furnishing of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "the installation of the revolving gates is also symbolically important".
The Secretary-General confirmed that there was no resistance from the employees: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated".
So, no more breakfast during office hours, no more coffee and no more brioche.
Brunetta smiles and advises, "A good cappuccino at seven in the morning can do wonders".
The College of Public Administration in Rome
In a meeting held in Brussels, the Minister stated that "in three months, the number of sickness absences in the public sector has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people coming into work in one year".
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more efficient
"which, according to the minister, has had a wage dynamic twice as high as the private sector over the last eight to 10 years and has far exceeded the rate of inflation".
At the same time, thousands of public officials gathered to join a petition sponsored by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Associations to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the minister of public administration boasts of data supporting the reduction of disease deficiencies, the 'tireless diarists' population keeps growing", says the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hardworking civil servants from all over Italy have gathered to declare war on the unlawful provisions of the decree".
The regional administrative court is challenging, inter alia, the abolition of supplementary allowances for sickness due to service reasons, the extension of the period of stay at home for workers on sick leave, which means the period within which the patient visitor can appear, and several other aspects contained in the new provisions provided for by the minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
In Italy, there are 2,500 work-related accidents every day, resulting in 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities.
According to the National Insurance Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, there were nearly 1,200 deaths at work in 2007.
The figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the leading causes of death, claiming nearly twice as many victims as homicide.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is organising a Day of Victims of Work Accidents in all the Italian counties, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the mass media to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, together with the tragic events of recent days, confirm the crucial role of prevention in workplace accidents", said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workplace Accidents Victims.
The President sincerely appreciated the association's "persistent commitment to workplace prevention, protecting the interests of workers who have suffered accidents, helping the families of victims and making public opinion receptive".
"It is natural and sincere to share the outrage of such tragedies, which are of such magnitude that they arouse the interest of the media and the public, but in reality we have to face dramatic incidents that are repeated over and over again every day".
Napolitano admits openly: 'We are certainly struggling with a lack of resources, and funding for education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within schools aimed at directing young people on the verge of entering the world of work are particularly important.
We have a duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, to ensure that the attention is not diverted from the social importance of the issue, and to ensure that more effective legislation is put in place.
The President of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "the serious social significance of fatal accidents at work, which we all bear in mind, and the need for the institutions to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"The figures for workplace accidents are slightly improving, but the number of such deaths is still staggeringly high", noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want this declining trend to be coupled with a declining attention span, because it's when attention is lost that the greatest tragedies happen".
"We believe that at the general level we are still not doing everything to combat the phenomenon that could be solved by a complex action programme.
"We believe that more control and controls are needed", Mercandelli stressed, "and more intervention in the field of labour market training, starting with schooling".
"Further efforts are also needed to inform and engage the public", he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon which is a problem at the societal level".
Mercandelli then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation protection net for victims of accidents at work" and the "direction in which the system has been drifting in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the security of insurance to workers, because the fate of accident victims cannot depend on arbitrary or even divisive measures by the legislature".
MP3 Players Can Harm Your Hearing
Long-term and high-volume listening to portable players such as MP3 players may cause permanent hearing loss.
The European Commission, in its report published in Brussels, referred to the opinion published today by the EU Scientific Committee on New and Recently Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"It is estimated that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player at a high volume for more than an hour a day for five years may suffer permanent hearing loss", says the explanation.
"It is alarming that young people who use portable loudspeakers and mobile phones in large numbers and frequently are unaware of the irreversible damage they can cause to their hearing", says Meglena Kuneva.
'Scientific studies indicate an undeniable risk to which we must respond urgently,' he added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate this information widely.
In the light of that opinion, it is also necessary to review existing control systems so that they can operate with adequate efficiency and keep pace with the latest technologies.'
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to investigate the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern and the European Commission is ready to explore, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, what possible measures could be put in place to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices", the committee member concluded.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise level for portable music players at 100 dB, however, there is growing concern about the data on hearing loss from the excessive use of such sound sources.
However, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise, which can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
The EU Scientific Committee's expert opinion states that users of portable players who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week have a noise level above the current maximum level for occupational noise.
If a person listens to music for a long time under similar conditions, he or she is at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects around 5 to 10 per cent of people who use portable devices, which could be 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno is setting up a committee for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs through March, results are due in June.
This is the timetable set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the work of the committee called "The Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work on the Rome guidelines.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated at the municipal assembly and the municipal committee, in order to submit the capital's strategic plan, which was officially approved by the municipal government and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
'It is a completely independent committee, with representation from all political, social and cultural perspectives,' emphasises Alemanno, 'and it is its task to develop proposals for the development of Rome, which can be relied upon by the political decision-makers, i.e. the Assembly and the Municipal Commission.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where big plans for the benefit of Rome could be born.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be dissolved, as it has a mandate for a limited period.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Commission "The Future of the Capital of Rome", the Mayor-General stated.
To those who dismiss the Commission's work as unnecessary, referring to the fact that the expert opinion it has drawn up is not binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the standard is right, as in France with the Attali Commission, which I am sure is true in Rome, the contribution it makes will play an important role.
The power of politics is often dispersed in the handling of daily affairs and in dealing with the emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, look further, taking into account the long-term perspective, and we plan for the longer term, and we are committed to the development and future of Rome".
The mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that 'this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'water-man', since it is completely free of charge, and will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, but rather serves as a stimulus and aims to attract the best minds of the capital'.
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to make the leap of quality it so badly needs, with a unified mindset about its future".
The future, which the mayor of Rome emphasizes "will be not limited to the current municipal framework but will look much further ahead", is not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also "the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. We'll show you why.
A well-known American politician who called himself an independent wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
Jimmy Carter was the first to ruin the American economy by his decisions and to cultivate close ties (as he does today as a private individual) with hostile Islam".
As the election approaches, the attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A Miami woman posted online: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama is shamelessly convinced that he can win the highest civil dignity of a nation that has had two governors and five senators of color".
These attacks are actually nothing -- they're racist, of course, but they don't answer the voters' question of whether he's going to be a good president.
In this case, there's someone who listens to his emotions and not his mind.
In the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in a headline: "We know well who the true American patriot is voting for in the voting booth.
It's a side of American thinking that's been hidden until the last moment.
"Just say what you want, and we'll know where to put the twins, Obama or McCain".
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
Never before have such words been uttered until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
Yet, despite all the trickery, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush.
When you ask 1,500 people what were the mistakes they made during Bush's time in office, 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they were so wrapped up in shit they flew home.
4,500 soldiers died in Iraq, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
The majority still thinks that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
It's a huge task for the man who will replace George W.
USA: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, it's time for restrictions in the publishing industry, and many people blame the Internet for the "death" of print.
The Pew Research Center asked 500 American journalists what they thought about the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost every journalist is pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not explicitly state that their concerns with regard to authenticity would have been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
They say the 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
The other serious problem is the newsroom, which is restricted to newspaper publishing houses.
If we do not want traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, to be reduced to a minimum, this problem must be solved, say the journalists interviewed.
Today, there is a distinct and complex pessimism in American journalism.
Sixty percent of the journalists and senior executives working in the print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
It's no problem for the press to see where the web is going.
The largest publishers are making their way to what many consider to be the "killer" of print.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has risen to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they were putting their voice behind technology, in the hope that it might be good for journalism.
Today, the American press is torn between the editors, or executives, and the reporters who work for them.
Nationally, 56 percent of executives are confident that their reporters will share their information with others, while locally, that figure is only 23 percent.
Some people associate this with a secure job.
Nationally, 47 percent of executives fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, that's 30 percent of the time.
In America, the issue of "safe work" at the team level (in our editors' case, ed.) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In a large nation like the United States of America, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet services, employers usually offer as many as they want, so the system is a must-have.
CEOs are usually paid high salaries, and editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, in addition to their pension and health insurance premiums.
However, the principle of leave is rather complex: x days in the first year, and the same in the third year, until after a certain period of time the maximum is reached at 15 days.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all about the weather.
The UNIPOL is in the GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the second criminal division of the Rome Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent, who wanted to move from his home in Grottaferrata to a flat in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the investigation into the Unipol-BNL share swap.
Last week, in the proceedings against him, his house arrest was lifted and changed to a restraining order for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate expert be allowed to move from a small rural town to a capital apartment.
However, the Court held that these moves (for which the prosecutor had proposed a negative decision) would allow the company to influence its business and to have access to the evidence brought against it.
The elite are in danger
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote on the $700 billion bailout package put forward by the White House: a significant number of Americans were more interested, and still are, in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is corroborated by yesterday's New York Times reporting that the current crisis has led to a split within the Republican Party, which is showing a growing divide between the traditional, restrained East Coast stance in favor of federal institutions and business circles and the new, increasingly anti-Washington and anti-global financial stance in the central and southern states.
This line of thinking was critically expressed in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
But this is only one of many significant changes that the economic reorganization that is still taking place is anticipating or allowing to be foreseen, not only in the United States but throughout the Western world and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, in the United States and in Europe, is only accelerating the phenomena that have been lurking for some time, that are consolidating in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the re-actualization, the reintroduction of the dual category of state sovereignty in the public consciousness, in a sort of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects banking and financial institutions which, while maintaining close links with foreign countries, are primarily, and quite broadly, dragging people and families who live in one country, one state.
This, however, presents a direct political challenge for those in power: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
So while the crisis may seem global in an economic sense, it is almost exclusively national in a political sense.
Political internationalism seems to have essentially been stranded: the European Union, which is lagging behind in its inability to define a single political direction, is a striking example of this.
So everyone is waiting for the national governments to intervene, the bailout, the recovery and the new rules, but most of all the opening up of the monetary funds: because in a crisis, only individual states have the economic resources, the financial stockpile that can make things right.
They have the means and the authority to use them: in the given circumstances, they have two resources of inestimable value, which probably no other market and no international organisation will ever have to such an extent.
The new emphasis on nation-states, which has been created by the crisis, is also in full accord with the fact that recent economic growth has given increasing importance to a factor closely linked to this element: territorial character.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the abstract world of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that are not the least abstract, like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, but they can be completely confined to a confined place, a confined area.
So whoever dominates the field has a lot more cards than whoever was unfortunately born in a place where there is no crops, no oil, no water.
And so I'm going to move on to the second innovation, which is a kind of fault line.
When you say territory, state, government, you're necessarily saying politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two overlapping phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition that we need authentic leadership, people who can take control of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, have been completely unfit and have shown that there is still much to be done.
The two together have even deeper implications and are in some ways more disturbing: the feelings of indebtedness, impatience, incompetence and isolation that are affecting the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that there is a growing belief among the population that the time of the social elite that has been at the top is over, before they have taken their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, and they are becoming more and more alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, in its enveloped form, is fuelling a wide-ranging but powerful delegitimization movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system, manifested in unexpected "riots" by voters or in recent sudden changes in public sentiment, such as the rise of the Conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, or the Bush rebellion against US congressmen (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with their parties and programs, and even if you could say their habits and their media and their prestigious intellectuals, are less and less understanding and therefore less and less able to represent what has been happening in the deepest layers of Western society for some time.
Yet, to speak of "the impending revolt of the masses" would be frankly an exaggeration.
But there's no harm in keeping your eyes open.
We can walk on the wall with super-glue.
With super-powered glue, you can overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several American research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to finding a solution.
With a mere two-and-a-half square centimeters of glue, the researchers were able to attach a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and hold it there.
THE American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team was the result of a further development of special materials with a pre-existing structure, known as carbon nanotubes.
"We need to think of the glue as a package of spaghetti-like glue", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew on the gecko's microscopic folded legs, which provide perfect grip.
Tests with materials such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of these reptiles, while "peeling off the walls", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's engineering department.
"This material may be useful as a temporary glue", adds Liming Dai.
Could we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe we can, but researchers are thinking about a less impressive use of it than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are very conductive of heat and electricity.
It can find further application in the field of space exploration.
The superheroes can wait.
MACHINE RESEARCH - The University of California, Berkeley, is also experimenting with a new glue.
According to an article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, scientists in California have demonstrated a glue made of a hairlike, microfilament material that self-cleans as it moves across a surface, always providing perfect adhesion.
No, not with the juice.
You have to be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high-vitamin soft drinks, especially popular in the summer, when ingested with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effects, depending on the case, and can have serious health consequences.
The risks of combining canned or fresh fruit juices with certain medications were highlighted by David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who announced at the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange, or apple could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medications, preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient's health.
Grapefruit juice has been used in the past by the defendants when it was found to increase the effects of certain antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiolytics, pacemakers and neurotrophs to levels considered toxic.
COMPLETE RISKS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official bulletin, warning doctors and patients to take the risks of such concomitant use seriously and to be careful about what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NO GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers say that oranges and apples also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that are inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices is available.
Michele Carruba, professor of the Department of Pharmacy at the State University of Milan, points out: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, which, if necessary, arrange for changes to be made to the information contained in the package leaflet.
Therefore, always read the package insert of the medicine you are going to buy, and if you do not understand something, do not let it influence you, but ask your doctor or pharmacist", emphasizes the expert of the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics.
Paul Krugman, an American economist, won the Nobel Prize in economics for his analysis of the spatial relationships between trade patterns and economic activity.
Krugman, 55, a neo-Keynesian, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a New York Times op-ed that the latter event would have even more fatal consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This prediction has been controversial, and has been challenged by economists on several occasions, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I am surprised and a little shocked at how quickly the public interest has gone beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "very valuable economist" but also "a rather aggressive critic of the Bush administration's excessive liberalism".
Open Office, the third edition was also worth the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open source application suite that enhances personal productivity as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, reaching a wider range of users, from home users to office users, from freelancers to government departments.
After almost a year of work overseen by SUN Microsystems and volunteer developers, the new Open Office comes with a number of new features, including a welcome screen and a redesigned, less Spartan user interface, as well as new features such as compatibility with Apple's Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO-compliant ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so that Open Office can open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
There are also some interesting module-specific features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphics module, while maintaining the page layout.
On the same interface, you can also create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or word processor elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports sharing workbooks but prevents overwriting each other's work. Each employee's comments are marked in a different color, which helps to make them easier to recognize during the checking phase.
Some companies are already working on making some of the OpenOffice features available on the web (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after being available on Mirror, has been available since Friday alongside the English version, available for download at: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The software package is available for Linux, in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
You can also request an installation CD at home or at work.
Free is probably the biggest attraction for home use, but the Open Office suite is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can also count on a number of government and school projects.
There is also no shortage of ideal education, consultancy and service services for SMEs, which can open up new business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a word processor equivalent to Word; Calc, a spreadsheet manager intended to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, the most well-known, similar to Access database manager; and finally Draw, the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but considering that we're already at 3.6 million by the time the new version comes out, that number is probably higher than expected.
Kohl's test came back positive, this is his fourth doping case.
The final stage of the Tour de France again produced a positive pattern, with one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl of Austria, racing in the Gerolsteiner team colours, who won the bronze medal and the best alpine skiing jersey.
The news was published on the Equipe Internetes newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider to test positive for Cera, the third generation version of EPO, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol of Italy and Stefan Schumacher of Germany, also a Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests we've been running for the last few weeks, was tested at the labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabrie.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from racing for two years according to the regulations.
The news of a positive result for Kohl's third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, who told the Associated Press that he had reported the positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to place behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and won the best alpine skiing jersey.
The New York Times is answering the question, "Is it racist?"
Italy has only recently turned from a country of immigrants to a favorite destination for reluctant immigrants.
This is the question posed by the New York Times, which, drawing on the case of a young Burkinabe man, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of cookies, devotes a long article to the debate over racism in Italy.
The case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "Northern paradox": the northern regions have the "highest levels of integration and employment" but also the "strongest levels of anti-immigration and Northern League support" in the country.
To support the growing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times cites incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
I mean, actually.
New laws demanded by the League to tighten the barrier on immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants were also highlighted as examples of the mood shift in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism".
Students suffer from expensive rent, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The market for university student accommodation is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by the Sunia, the Tenants' Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples, and 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has reached such an astonishing level that, due to the high costs for families, it excludes large sections of students from the opportunity to study", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price increase has been triggered for local residents".
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts without a rental limit, linked leases.
Sunia argued that an exceptional measure would be necessary to maximise prices by means of a review of the taxation system.
The survey details show that in Milan, in the Brianza area, a bed costs 450 euros; the average price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (Bande Nere area) to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) and can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most students live in close proximity to the university, a bed costs €250/280 for a double bed and €370-500 for a single bed.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they charge about 600 euros for a single bed and 450 euros for a double bed.
Prices are somewhat cheaper (€550 per single room) in the vicinity of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In suburban areas, there are some savings: a bed costs €300 and a single room costs €450 in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
In Naples, beds cost between 300 and 450 euros, and rooms cost between 400 and 600 euros, with the highest rates in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, a bed costs €250/350 and a single room costs at least €350.
In smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms but they have a greater impact on the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are also often looking for accommodation, there is another anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, the cities have sacrificed the time of the old cinemas
Traditional theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without a cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
The images, made by Giuseppe Tornatore, show what is happening in the Italian cities and in the rural areas.
The suppression of the cinema - the emergence of large, multi-screen cinemas in the suburbs and the consequent decline of single-screen cinemas in the city centres - is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When places of history and memory disappear, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences, were gone", says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which won the Academy Award and the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival for Tornado 20 years ago, tells the story of a small-town movie theater, the longing for a movie experience that may have been lost forever.
The figures reported by the largest association of operators, Anec, are clear: 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years. e biggest losses were recorded in cinemas in the major cities: 10 cinemas in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 one-screen cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that the expansion of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance is best demonstrated by the fact that Italy has the highest number of new multi-screen cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of cinemas has increased by 195 in Lombardy, by 81 in Tuscany and by the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of theatres in Italy has increased in an irrational way", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "It's okay to build new facilities, but we also have to ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all the tenants are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the unfunded financial support for operators: the State's outstanding debt amounts to approximately EUR 10 million.
It is a shame, both ethically and morally, that the government does not comply with the existing laws.
The market would require EUR 16-18 million per year to maintain.'
Bologna is particularly noteworthy, being the first Italian city to address the issue of closures by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and improve the outdoor and downtown single-screen cinemas.
The provisions would include tax concessions for operators and benefits for the public to promote accessibility: spectators could enter restricted areas and park in certain parking lots at a discounted rate.
"I like this initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example, perhaps by introducing other measures.
But it's also clear that traditional cinema, in order to be able to take on the battle of multiplex dominance, needs to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audiences are much more demanding.
Preserving the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me, and the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheri, where I spent my childhood and adolescence, gave me the spark that eventually led me to make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale, to the closed Rialto or the Quirinale, so I don't see the posters blackened by dust, I turn my head.
In a tight wedge between politics and the 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in the municipal elections".
The judges of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate have issued serious charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external participation in a criminal conspiracy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and the lawyer's nephew, whose name is the same as the boss, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like criminal organization, were also handed a €10 million fine.
"The disregard for all legal and moral rules, and even for good taste", the prosecutors write.
"The clan would have had official access to the town hall, "which would have given it additional control and control over the administration, "which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabria regional assembly, makes no secret that there are "many collisions between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: in some areas, where the mafia is more prevalent than elsewhere, collusion is almost inevitable.
But many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean".
This morning's arrests are a continuation of the events of July, when the police announced that they had succeeded in exterminating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their duties in the administration of the municipality.The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro had already been dissolved in 1991 because of alleged collusion between organized crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor who served at the break-up, was elected in the 2006 second round to lead the centre-right coalition.
He called a scandal when the county board ordered the municipal board to be dissolved.
He summoned the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minnini to court, accusing him of plotting a political plot, but the court in its arrest warrant signed this morning stated that the Piromalli clan had gone so far as to demand that the A3 project be changed.
The prosecutors wrote that the interception ordered against Dal Torrione revealed that he was "willing to comply with the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs known to be close to the Piromalli family, subordinating the decisions of the municipal government to the interests of the clan".
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible source of energy that covers 70 percent of the planet's surface and is just being discovered by the big international energy companies
Waves, tides, tides, all renewable energy sources that have been the eyes of giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on it.
For over a century, research has been exploring the possibility of extracting energy from the movement of the sea, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research intensified.
The idea of using offshore energy was abandoned around 1980 when the price of oil fell, but today the demands of environmental protection and the renewed rise in the price of oil give the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by installations that harness the tides of the seas.
That's twice as much as what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
And then there'd be the currents and the tides.
The giants are in a frenzy.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy and signed an agreement in 2005 for a power plant to be built in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed, and more and more companies are starting to speak out for offshore energy, including some that have been committed supporters of conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies that harness the energy of the oceans and is considering working with us", a spokesman for one of the oil giant's subsidiaries told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the issue of obtaining the permits required by the US Energy Commission for the start-up of the offshore power project in Alaska.
This is not insignificant, especially considering that the United States is currently drilling for oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan to drill further.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also pursuing offshore energy, and the amounts invested so far, as far as details are known, are evidence of growing interest.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
Experts say that this is still a very early technology, partly because the environmental impact of energy from the sea is not being addressed.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small and therefore do not pose too much of an ecosystem problem.
However, to produce energy on a larger scale, facilities with a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The thrust of the waves that move the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by the plugs and cylinders inside.
The pressure turns a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to land by cables that run under the sea.
There are currently four similar facilities in the planning stages, pending federal approval, and some of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started to generate power for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six underwater turbines in the East River estuary of New York.
When the current is moving, the water moves the turbines' blades, and this rotational motion feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that it has a long list of partners waiting only for the necessary permits to use the energy.
Waves after waves.
At present, there is a need to pay special attention to the opportunities that can be exploited by the tidal wave.
Although a periodic phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus are a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine, Alaska, and other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 to harness the tidal power, and that's projected to grow to $35 million by 2009.
