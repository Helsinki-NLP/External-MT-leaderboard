Tom knows all about them.
Did you get any sleep?
Tom is a crazy kid.
That's the way it is.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're taking for the test.
I think two languages are not enough.
I wonder if I could borrow your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I drive to church.
You're much smarter than me.
Who 's left ?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write it all down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's gonna be home by 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm out of work.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.

Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom. He's got a gun.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?

Sit down, please.
Do you have any ?

Is that okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me ?
Could I know where you work?
Can someone please explain this to me?
Who is she?

I wanted to die.
It doesn't matter to me whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about the money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like people.
I learned a lot.
We can't trust the outsiders.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me make my position clear.
I never stopped loving Mary.

Tom is no hero.
I'm glad I could help.

You sure you're not imagining things?
Don't make excuses.
He walks slowly.
Come with us.
Nobody wants to take the blame.

Are you sure you pressed that last button ?

Tom said he thought I looked impressed.
I get drunk at least once a month.

You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog".
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's a beautiful theory indeed, but the only flaw I think it has is that it's probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.

It's too noisy in here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.

Where did you find the key?
Could this not be right?

Please, tell me what you think.
Tom's waiting for you.
He 's Italian , isn 't he ?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.

We suffered.
Tom was impressive.
Mary is wary of strangers.
We'll fire.

Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who is Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door open.
I live here.
I hope you call back.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Speak more slowly.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how are you?
Tom married a Canadian.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.

This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before dark.
Are you drunk ?
He tried to write a novel.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going ?

I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made a few mistakes on the test.

I was so angry.
I got it.
I don't like it, honestly.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.

It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one is coming.
If you're busy, I can help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend is here.
I'm thirty years old.

I'll buy one.
I can see that.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.

It's pointless.
Tell them it's important.
The party's on Sunday.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to the snoring.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How do you pronounce that word?
He saved me.
I have an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get yourself drunk.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it ?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has dark circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.

Look what I did!
Tom is a Harvard graduate.
You have 30 days.

Russian is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother tongue in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and widely used, though without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm older than she is.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to reach Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three".
Boil some water.
I wish I was Canadian.
Are you sure you pressed the last button ?
We got a positive ID.

She's almost 20 years old.
You have to stay.

Are you angry with Tom?
My parents live a carefree life in the country.
He lost all his money in the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good look.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Thomas called me names.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your command the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use that?
They killed her.
My car is dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.
Who's in charge now?
I'm with child.
Can you teach me some French?
I'll show you how it works.
What did you tell them about us ?
These are our children.

What's Tom bringing?
The novel has been translated into many languages.
Tom must be over thirty.
Help me get him up.
Tell them I'm ready.
Are you ready for tonight?
It seems to me you should be able to do this yourself.
Count your change.

I think they go to Australia just for fun.
Tom's cheeks turned red.
This is Richard.
What did you use to open it ?
Would you like to make a reservation for a trip to Australia?

Tom will understand.
Where did he kiss you ?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
