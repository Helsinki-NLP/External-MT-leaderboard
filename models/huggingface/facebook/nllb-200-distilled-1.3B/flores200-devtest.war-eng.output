While an experimental vaccine is emerging that has reduced Ebola mortality, so far no drugs have been shown to be adequate to treat the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggest that it has little benefit against the intended mortality reduction.
In the PALM trial, the ZMapp vaccine served as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline vaccine and compared three other treatments against it.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is spreading, but it provides details that the fossil record does not usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional shapes.
Scientists say that the animal's skin is chestnut-brown on the surface with a scaly or carotenoid coloration on the underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-formed shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics  barbs and barbels  researchers have concluded that the rachis was a late evolutionary advance against these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or vision. Researchers suggest that, although this was the tail of a baby dinosaur, the specimen showed adult hair and not a kitten skin.
Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a baby dinosaur, the specimen shows adult hair and not a kitten skin.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic inversions.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to mimic observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team sought is caused by the forces of gravity between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull on the earth causes clouds, so the Milky Way exerts its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists say that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way to regular matter.
This theory holds that the dark matter around a galaxy appears in a galaxy in a sort of halo, and it is made up of many tiny particles.

They are more likely to be exposed to the surrounding air during the day and to be hot at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not like that of the Earth's large continuous caverns and sinkholes that maintain a relatively uniform temperature, but it is consistent with the deepest craters in the earth", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is a traditional low-tech experience: the voter stands alone in a booth, a pre-printed piece of paper informing their chosen candidate is placed in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.

Adekoya was present at Edinburgh Sheriff Court when she was charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody while awaiting trial and trial, but any evidence found may be unclean because his image has been exposed to the public.
This practice is common elsewhere in the UK but the justice system operates differently in Scotland and the court sees the publication of the photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists often walk a dangerous line when publishing photos and other information about suspects".
The Crown Office, which handles the cases, informed the press that no further comment would be released even until the trial.
The document, according to the publisher, refers to border fighting, which Palestine wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed were the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel mandated a continuous military presence in the mountains for ten years at the time of the signing of an agreement while the PA agreed to withdraw from such a presence in just five years.
The shooters in additional pest control trials should be screened by the authorities, since the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation receive comprehensive rescue and training instruction.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the early removal of the CEP as part of a move to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's solution to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Some 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overuse were reported, resulting in a total of six fires that left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says that it is aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had 34 more overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's lack of an immediate report "extremely transient"
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said that no landslides had been reported.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer abducted Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A few hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead on the spot.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Soon, the photographers switched places with the elderly woman because she had to use a sink. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began investigating premature labor during her off-hours.
His research shows that when the hormone is maintained, it can accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had seized two black box recorders from the flight on Wednesday.
Luna is still revered by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the happiest Queen of Extreme. My happiest manager. Luna died on the night of the moon two. She was just as different as she was. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels comments that "Luna has a sense of humor just like me...maybe even more...I love her and miss her...she's in great shape".
Out of 1,400 people who polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled held the same view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should soon become a republic, while 31 percent thought that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but her health was under suspicion due to her complaints.
He was unable to take the medicines needed to help relieve the pain because they were forbidden from the Mulays.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using multilingual hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have originated by bringing water to earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have struck the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the talkers as "political talkers and fools".
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system promoted by the FAA that allows aircraft to fly short distances and save millions of gallons of fuel a year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology that allows traffic on the surface to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional cars will be placed and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will no longer be used below.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the mules would be forced to hide behind locked doors without support from the group.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to be much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be wrapped in thin wire, which can be twisted and sewn together, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made too thin, and it can be glued to other metals, or it can be made too thin, which is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make a marker with the red juice of cabbage.
Cabbage juice varies in color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (H at pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons held together by their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Sprinkle two dry powders and then, with clean, clean hands, rub them into a ball.
The skin on your hands reacts to the outer layers, which become sensitive to sound and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the urinal system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were still common in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared in a communal company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then immediately sends it back down.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of our light and light.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet high is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing it has done for us is to provide us with easier and faster transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below this are just the right size of fangs that eat just the right size of prey from rabbits to antelopes and one.
Finally, many small chicks (including uncastrated female chicks) eat smaller prey such as insects, grasshoppers, cockroaches, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of localization, a special function of each thigh that prevents competition from others.
Lions are the most social of all the cubs, living in large groups called pride.
The prides were completed by one to three male companions of appropriate age, along with up to thirty women and children.
Women were usually close to one another, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave like pack wolves or dogs, animals that behave like lions (but not like big cats), and they even kill their prey.
A fearless athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit poorly), swim, jump long distances, and jump five times as fast as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not the same as the full sound of the lion's roar, but it is more like a sound of violent, shouting words.
The ocelots prey on small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds - almost all of which are smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and seek out prey (victims) by their sense of smell, which is a natural response to their location.
They can see well even in the dark with night vision, and they act in secret. The ocelots grab their prey by moving around and then jump on their victim.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the dominant population from which it came (as when it moves to mountains or rivers, or when it moves to a new island to avoid re-movement) it often finds itself in a different environment from where it lived before.
This new environment has a variety of resources and a variety of competitors, so the new population will need a variety of qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor against what they previously needed.
The original population remained largely unchanged, still requiring the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to appear to be shrinking like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be different in appearance and will no longer be considered the same creature.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable destination and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they also take in carbon dioxide that humans emit (namely, respiration).
Plants obtain their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our houses from plants and our clothes from plants. We eat mostly plants, without which animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the most advanced of its time, so it was not to be feared, except by other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is lined with 70 sharp teeth, including an extra set of canines, meaning that it can not bite anything that crosses its path.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a sharp tongue, which fed on whales, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even became cannibals.
He also attacks anything that can get into the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex.
While the taste of their food may be familiar, the Romans also had a number of unusual festival items, including wild boar, peacocks, breasts, and a species of worm called the dormouse
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their meals while sitting on the benches, the rich preferred to eat where they sat on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include the foods brought to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primeval temple for each of their gods, whom they believed to be the dwelling place of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home is not important.
The rest of the Hebrew family life takes place outside.
Women are cooking in the fields; shops are open as a street canvas; houses are built with stone.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated, and Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey farther west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even before his discovery, the area was inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have many differences in people, kings, customs, and history.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think of a map of wealth written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a message on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text below the document appears reversed.
While no one can be sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was folded up for preservation.
Thus, the notation may have been added simply as a label.
The approaches of D-Day and the ensuing fighting liberated northern France, but not just the south.
It was ruled by "Vichy" French, French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them rather than fight against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied southern France, the occupation being called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had cleared southern France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture sustained by that vast mass of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and similarly describes the size of society.
The city-states are the origin of nations. A culture of civilization describes the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a continuous cultural cycle and an equal distribution.
A host of smaller cultures disappear without leaving historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with Congress composing it under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks any power to enforce taxes, and, with no executive or judicial branch, it relies on state authorities, often non-cooperative, to carry out all its functions.
They still had no authority to impose tax laws and tariffs between the states.
Articles require full consent from all states before they can be amended and states ignore the central government only insofar as their representatives are absent.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international championships and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that comprise Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipel"
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when passing European explorers recorded the name of the island as Formosa Island, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a shift away from native rice production and toward employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it transferred control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
The ruins of the buildings along the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they really looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired, and the work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio is more important than that of digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit of a mess, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by the dose to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The law of extremes and moderates is the simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining a smooth scale in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main story is where the lines that divide the third image vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states behind linguistic and cultural differences.
Its universal power extended to everyone from kings to common people.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and that church funds should be used for that very purpose.
The center of church authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years and that concentration of power and money raises many questions about whether this belief holds.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched an offensive against German waters.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this disruption violated some of the generally accepted international laws created by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire stretch of the sea, making even neutral shipping dangerous.
With a limited answer to this tactic, Germany was waiting for a similar answer for its relentless submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing habits of the indigenous peoples and nations were pacifism and separatism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations hoped to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time points; each Chinese state or ruling family was a different dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times fierce battles took place between the many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, the Three Kingdoms saw thousands of people die fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xian.
There were many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, jobs were still open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, where the ranks are now based on rank rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other poor working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave that became known as Hira on the hill of Noor (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knew it existed, it is not easy to find it.
Nothing but a beautiful sky above and many mountains surrounding it could be seen or heard from the depths of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid was one of many large pyramidal structures erected in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up bow mark is V-shaped and the down bow mark is staple-shaped or square-shaped without its bottom.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and wrap the bow.
The up-bow is more gentle, while the down-bow is louder and more powerful.
Feel free to cover your own bows, but remember that printed bows are for musical purposes, and they should be respected.
The feared King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return on 6 October 1789 from Versailles by a tumultuous group of women in the marketplace.
In a carriage, they journey back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open wide the window of their carriage.
On one occasion a member of the rioters flagged the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in the presence of the frightened queen.
The costs of U.S. imperialism's war of occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will make up for the major gains made by U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that propelled the creation of the order.
The age in which the events occurred is generally called the High Middle Ages the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that takes a broad range of ideas of action, from the need-technology or the necessary technology to the strict sense that human destiny is pushed under the logic that involves the law of sensation and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism follow two general ideas: that technological progress itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has effects on social phenomena, rather than social conditioning.
For example, someone might argue that a motorized car must lead to improved roads.
However, a nationwide network would not be economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
The possession of a mass of cars brings a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new treatments for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged, and these, united in a social space, were better opposed to the established imposed laws.
This is how Paris became known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of pride began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
His status was shattered in the twelfth century by the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices more expensive than those offered in Byzantine markets.
Asia was at that time that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Byzantine culture began to exert a strong influence on clothing in the east.
However, with slow communication, western style lags some 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to create their own style. One of the greatest achievements of the time as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to sew their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is produced for the production of food that is just enough to provide for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, highly organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion interspersed with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel disconnected from society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that characterize a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and idioms.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of social contact is to take some sad cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were cut off from adult contact as they grew up.
Some violent children are imprisoned by humans (their own parents' abuses); in some cases this is abandonment of children because of the parent's denial of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Violent children may have experienced severe abuse as children or trauma when abandoned or on the run.
Some were raised in a stable by animals; others were thought to live alone in the forest.
When raised naked by nonhuman animals, a violent child displays behaviors (including physical limitations) that are almost identical to that particular caregiver, such as his fear or disdain for humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an aid that provides support to individuals who are immersed in a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, that is, the teacher is a form of scaffold but also a small paperclip human being in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in software and are intended to ask questions, reason, explain techniques that might tempt the student to do alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to bullying.
No child should grow up in an environment that is uncaring, uncaring, and uneducating, but they are.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, reliable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home where they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the internet has led to an additional dimension in the use and strategy of giving pleasure.
For example, knowledge and communication have been suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuing relationships were also identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the user response to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of tiny facial expressions, facial expressions that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell when a person is lying by correctly interpreting small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, explains how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still understand sincerity correctly.
He even suggests that such a capacity to interpret human behavior may have been given to animals such as the dog.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, which selection removes from the cluster of manifested variation.
Separation and re-union account for the variation over and over between the two groups in each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest sources of plant protein are proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seeds, seeds, and seeds) not only digest easily but also provide high levels of protein that contains all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to what chimpanzees do today in the forest.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleeping time and falling asleep only briefly (1060 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a seemingly silent alarm clock to alert you to the fact that you are not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your clock in your sleep, it may be placed somewhere else in the room, forcing you to work to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing one to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress a person has on his body and spirit.
The less stress there is, the more positive life forces there are. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only obstacle to this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is supplemented by the glorious path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, combining Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of activating Kundalini energy (light energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of God. Through visualization of various gods the pathways of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the realization of light is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, a disruption of the system, processes and culture led to the collapse of the nations.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies now clashed and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years of real, proxy warfare, in the trenches from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were dashed overnight, however, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army marched into and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is today the most efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your nation maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the Americans tried to bring people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Britain, like the rest of Europe, might have been taken over by Germany.
Goats were apparently first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to slaughter them for quick access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Goats were usually kept in flocks that grazed on hillsides or other pastures, often under the care of young shepherds, similar to the more well-known shepherd.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although the carriages were made of the same wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve faster speeds and to haul larger loads against the slightly more difficult road of the early era.
Crossties were introduced earlier to hold the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be better if they had a metal surface.
This became common, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, which began standing two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, could not walk upright as they had been used to.
Bipedal specialization can be seen in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can support environmental causes, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering in some areas.
However, if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has been greatly changed by human advances in science and technology, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known surviving copies of the document, and the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today - the birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that seem to be similar to dinosaurs.
They have arched legs and claws, they bark, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information in the encoded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, should be so general that a short-term diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Look at the label for specific instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug has been used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the familiar Sudlot, insects that are known to be parasitic on humans.
Both Assassin-bug and Sudlot are nidicolous, adapted to live in a host's nest or house.
Across the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disorder in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
Such a couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the adoptive parents take over their parental rights for the other couple to become the child's parents.
The primary purpose of science is to understand how the universe works in a scientific way, a method that has actually guided most scientific research.
Although not a stand-alone, experimentation, and experiment is an experiment used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations and still guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all spheres of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West saw itself as being lost to its philosophical and scientific origins.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue during the free-running cycle, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germ-line cells.
Mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Environment-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of recreating the sights, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and ecosystems.
One example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the orphanages in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work, and some find that the destination of work is the place they left behind.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everything seems to be connected, and supportive, of a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of the stable states that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone participated in society and used transportation systems. Almost everyone complained about transportation systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or did something happen earlier?
Traffic behavior is the study of the behavior of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic patterns is challenging because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers are likely to operate within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic movements are likely to have some reasonable similarity and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key indicators: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of street facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be transported by air, and their ability to fly enabled them to avoid predators more quickly and to find food and mates more easily.
Insects usually have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back onto their bodies.
This gives them a wider area in a smaller area to hide from their predators.
At present, the only insects that do not flap their wings are the dragonfly and the fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people believe that he is right but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth does not appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is still the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles [six km] in width.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The largest is the 6,387-kilometer-long (3,980-mile) Amazon River, which collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical quality of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians was impressed by its earlier monuments, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian remains the everyday language of most state employees while Latin is the predominant language used in religious ceremonies.
Almost all the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in native form and can be mined relatively easily with modern equipment.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed that the universe was composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he still theorized that these change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can still make alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of these words.
Thus, the pencil is a good companion for many when it comes out.
Sadly, as new writing techniques advanced, the pencil was moved to a lower state and use.
People now type messages on a computer screen, not sitting in front of a screen.
One can only wonder what the keyboard would be like if something newer came along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to split a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
The reassembly of the nucleus releases some of that energy, much like rolling a chariot over a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they degrade with little or no thrust.
The Moon's surface is made of rocky and muddy material, and the outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is nearly 70 km thick at the nearest point and 100 km thick at the farthest point.
It is thinner below the surface and thicker below the mountains.
There may still be a nearby sea because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what will entice people or what will attract them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that are applied while they are at the right age or maturity.
These theories look at what makes certain people like what they do and what factors in their environment influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In the overall story, both sides may emerge as managers begin to take the lead over their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and retaining people.
At the far end of the spectrum, one may be an unknown individual who feels the need to change everything the group does and do it on their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the contact point for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy over familiar team members because their team may be grouped around different time zones that their local manager may not understand.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a distinctive feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the governing group to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization be willing to go through the time-consuming process of building an organization for study? One goal for training in organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the productive department of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can occur.
As a result, an organization's process of helping to overcome a difficulty may lead to a new adaptive process to meet the customer's need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as share knowledge and wisdom with the organization.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive investigation, thus reducing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
It provides us with a wealth of information to build simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI forms a major branch of computer science, involving behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation to a machine.
AI research includes the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as represented by some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom, and a teacher often wants to take his students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to demonstrate a trip and experiences to future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, the website is updated annually, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of a global audience changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to work on his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more intelligent about the world around them". The need to keep an audience interested inspires students to be intelligent and interesting. - Toto, 2004.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend what they learn beyond a traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can make sense of their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the far south of Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders consider a true Canadian.
The large northern areas are sparsely populated and some are almost entirely forested.
To the surprise of many, for a comparison of populations: More African Americans live in the U.S. than in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or belong to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs continued to bring Islam to the mainland, and it was adopted in large measure in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the east and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wife: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It can still be helpful to wear a ring (not just the expensive one).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and unusual pursuits, hugs, and so forth.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand up (cultural differences or not, that will not be okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was demolished by the Portuguese and rebuilt under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and renamed it Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina are more easily found places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the full spectrum of geegaw, but all for tourists.
Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a tourist city in the easternmost part of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered the city streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is still a safe area, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbukti" has been used as a metaphor for a strange, remote land.
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling town, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to threats from desert sand dunes.
It was one of the main stops during the special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic versus African wisdom.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and lies along the border with Mozambique to the north, with the northern border being the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a diverse wildlife.
It is a major attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee for the park.
It may still be useful for someone to buy a Wild Card, which gives entry to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and the place that tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a sparkling bar chart seen through the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The highly developed province of Hong Kong Island is a corner of reclaimed land along the northern coast.
It is the area that the British colonists took as their own and if you are looking for evidence of colonial past the territory, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal plain, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands from the coast.
The Sundarbans is declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However the forests are not only a jungle  they include some of the last remaining standing of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbands cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 wild geese in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are usually full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers rise to a height of 83 meters (279 feet), are 1,378 feet (378 meters) long, and have two lanes each 12 feet (3.50 m) wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic invaders still trained to make a living in agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained many of its indigenous customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most violent polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year took place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and rivalries can still be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklan pound (FKP) with a fixed value equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be transferred to the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and on Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are still commonly accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with holders of more advanced ones to see what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures can normally rise to as high as +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but air and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rain" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
While many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wildlife is also wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
According to park officials, a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears or wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife should be maintained!
No matter how friendly they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they cannot maintain proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of the most important leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is connected to two ports.
North Shore beach (in the North Harbour district) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beach is almost completely clear and provides plenty of shade from the lush trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
It is a typical family beach with many shops lining the beach.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but is delicious and refreshing.
Many French wines are drinkable, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available when you are in a panic.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign - the short black is espresso, the cappuccino is full of cream (not froth), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and damage from any cause to the reef is rare.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety reminders.
Box jellyfish show up near the shores and near the estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The Saltwater Crocodile is not active in the oceans, their main habitat being in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have deals with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages with breakfast included, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They can still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should get in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Note that even after the main parts of the party have finished, there may be parts of the party where music continues to play until midnight.
Some festivals have a special campground for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, consider the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice will cause a terrible noise for those most affected.
Trips to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the required visas (see terms).
Casinos often go to great lengths to save time and money for visitors, often without windows and clocks, and the windows are hard to find.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in the area.
Likewise, drunkenness can impair judgment, and all who enjoy good drinking know the importance of staying in a good frame of mind.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or beyond on mountain trails must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy, snowbound roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if you were on tarmac.
During a blizzard, the right amount of snow to keep you warm can fall in a matter of hours.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on the windows of the car.
On the other hand, freezing conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a land trip to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are usually near cars and standard equipment will allow good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, which can be done over a period of hours or days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the first games in 1964.
If you booked your flights for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not come into effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing close to ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a plank and ironing board that can be used to wash clothes even when no one is in the room.
If you do not have a plunger, or if you do not want to wear a plunger, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to become too hot (which can cause burns, or in extreme cases, heat).
There are a variety of methods of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, a one-minute boil is sufficient, in others a few minutes are needed.
Filters work in different ways, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as intoxicating liquors and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont shows the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: Steep gradients, narrow roads, and steep curves remain.
The posted speed limits are noticeably shorter against the preceding and following sections -- usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) -- and strict adherence to them is more important against anything else.
Surprisingly, though, mobile phone service is stronger here compared with many other long-distance routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather spicy, and in Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and varied, as in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry, with apples baked in pastry throughout the year, and cherries and plums that show during the summer are common.
Many German baked goods still offer almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you prefer a small but tasty pastry, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a vegetable- and spice-based dish, accompanied by any meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "soft" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is the common ingredient in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, cucumber neck is the common ingredient.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualification, the term can mean that the food originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely used throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features simple dishes, the primary ingredients known to the Javanese are peanuts, beans, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of spices.
The posts provide support for the rider's foot while sitting under or on the side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to press against them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one leg is caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged off the horse by the distance it travels.
First, most riders wear riding boots that are tight and smooth, with relatively short heels.
Next, some saddles, particularly the English saddle, have safety bars that give way to a leather seat that falls onto the saddle when pulled back by a fallen rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its varied granite walls and cliffs.
The summits include the breathtaking views from above, and climbers from all over the world continue to make new routes through the infinite potential of the walls.
Low-snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered ground with a ski or snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many people involved, sometimes known as "ski bumpers", who plan an entire holiday around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Low-skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
These are related to but generally exclude alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on sloping terrain and requiring heavier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a parallel to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover longer distances versus walking -- but you rarely get the thrill of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on good roads.
Europe is a relatively small continent but one with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means going through many visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen zone, however, seems to be a country worthy of it.
As long as you live in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you do not have to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiquity, and some tax authorities classify items older than 100 years as antiques.
The explanation has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America versus Europe.
Handicraft products are classified as antiques, even though they are younger compared with similar products made by most merchants.
Reindeer herding was an important part of the Sami's livelihood, and the culture surrounding trade is still important to many other professions.
Although traditionally, as well, not all Sámi are involved in large numbers of reindeer herding, but live from fishing, hunting and the like, having reindeer are often used as working animals.
