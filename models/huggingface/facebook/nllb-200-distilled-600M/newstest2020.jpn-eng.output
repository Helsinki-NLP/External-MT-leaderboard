Driving on high heels is dangerous!
There have been many accidents involving pedal-stepping by young people. - Yahoo! News
 Violations of the traffic laws of the road
While there has been a growing body of reports of accidents caused by mismanagement, such as pedal footsteps, it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem for older drivers only.
According to 2015 Police Service data, the highest number of pedestrian-stepping accident incidents per year was 1,080 under the age of 24, which resulted in 1,032 over the age of 75.
It is important to draw the same attention to younger people, not to the elderly who never make mistakes.
Would you like to take a footstool?
Are you taking security?
While this data does not describe the ratio of males to females, it also considers the reasons for the discrepancy between older people, who are often thought to be the result of physical decline, such as driving skills or reflex nerves, and the reasons for the complete error of footsteps, such as the lack of attention to music, conversation, and other things in the youth.
Women, especially, are often forced to choose between high heels, pumps, sandals, mules and the various shoes they wear for the day.
While some find it difficult to change shoes, knowing that they are not suitable for driving, many are driving with little thought or malice about the potential for danger.
However, driving on high-heels and sandals violates the road traffic laws.
One is "the safe handling of the handle, brake and other operations"; and "the breach of the duty to drive safely" of Article 70, which states "you must not drive in a manner that would cause harm to the person causing the accident".
And another, Section 71 of the Public Safety Commission's Compliance Act, which requires drivers to comply with the requirements set by the Metropolitan Municipality Public Safety Committee, for example, the regulations for the implementation of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Act, section 12 states that "you shall not drive vehicles except light vehicles, wearing shoes that are suitable for riding, slippers, heels, or other means of obstructing driving operations, or wearing shoes that hinder driving operations".
The same is true for all Metropolitan Municipalities and High Heels, which even if not specified, consider driving in "shoes that may impede driving".
So why is it so dangerous to drive on high heels?
This is obvious when you consider the basics of pedal handling safely.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first, you must fasten the heel to the bed, place the foot upright against the brake pedal, and tilt the heel to the right as a pedal when stepping on the axle pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not break, regardless of the vehicle's behavior.
But on a high heel, the floor area of the foot is small, always crouched with grills, the heel height is angled at the entire foot, the pedal footprint is smaller and less able to fit tightly, and fine adjustment is more difficult.
This is thought to lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor mats, but this material can easily pull the heel when the heel is tight, brake when the heel is tight, or when the heel is tight, the heel is unstable and the heel is unstable.
In addition, there are instances where the heel is pulled backwards when the pedal is pushed backwards, and the axle pedal is no longer able to return.
Toyota, Svalbard and its subsidiaries are now in the process of accelerating joint development, including new AWD vehicles and 86/BRZ next-generation models.
Toyota Motor and SUBARU (Sbar) agreed on a new business capital partnership on September 27.
Toyota acquired additional Subar shares and became a subsidiary of the holding company under the applicable law.
Since the two companies agreed on a business partnership in 2005, they have been working together on the production of Toyota vehicles by Subar, the supply of vehicles from Toyota to Subar, the joint development of the FR sports car '86' and 'BRZ'.
Also in June this year, we agreed to work on developing EV-specific platforms and EV vehicles that leverage Subar's AWD and Toyota's electrification technology.
In the business capital partnership agreed this time, Toyota will acquire additional Subar shares.
The Subar shares currently held by Toyota are 16.83 percent, but they are being acquired by a further 20% until they reach the voting rate.
Sbal will become a subsidiary of Toyota's holding law application.
Subal, meanwhile, will acquire Toyota shares worth the amount Toyota required to acquire Subal shares, equivalent to the amount of up to 80 billion yen.
The two companies have developed and strengthened cooperation through a business capital partnership.
We will continue to develop the AWD model and the 86/BRZ secondary model together, expand the THS to suburban vehicles, coordinate in the connected area, and coordinate technology in the autonomous driving area.
For 18,000 years in a row, the minimum refugee reception limit has been reached.

The land industry on the island of Harajuku, near the end of the "Taylor waste" production process, is in the process of filing for bankruptcy with a debt of about 2 billion yen.

Our company is a manufacturer of watches founded in June 1895 and incorporated in April 1961.
Initially, he started his business as a real estate industry in the area of the island of Teru in the city of West Teru in the state of Teruang, under the trade name of "Koshishite".
In October 86 it acquired the business of the merger of the cooperative and industrial companies, and at the same time, changed its name to the current company and moved its headquarters to its current location.
Later, it opened its business base in Fukushima, Hiroshima, Daizuke, and Miyagi, becoming the current system, whereas it had previously been mainly based on grapevine, and due to changing consumer needs, it now produces 70% of the world's production of flat-panel water, 70% of the world's production of grapevine and 30% of the world's production of water.
It has built a broad business base in the heart of West Japan, including big-hand house makers, building materials companies, roofing operators, and in December 2004 had annual sales of about 316 million yen.
It had a reputation as the top watermaker on the island.
However, the demand for residential housing has been increasing as the downturn in the housing market since the Lehman shock, the greater damage caused by the earthquake in East Japan, the Kumbon earthquake, and the further deterioration of the roofs of consumers have caused the demand to grow, and the annual turnover in December 2018 has fallen to about 1.345 billion yen.
In terms of revenue, in addition to the lower interest rates associated with fuel prices rising, the company was forced to undergo severe capital spending and continued deficits with excessive profitable debt associated with inventory burdens and equipment investments.
As a result, although the financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business, such as demanding that borrowing be relaxed, there was no sign of recovery, and the financing was gradually forced to shrink.
Having come here and not been able to support the continuation of the business, this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

How can I get a drink at the Rinpoche School of Art team?
The first day of the teamwork event is a stage welcome (Movie Walker) - Yahoo! News
The first day of the first stage of the filming of the Kinomi Academy, which is a film adaptation of the popular novel Kinomi, was held on September 27 at TOHOshinemaz-sinjuku, and stars Shioshima秀俊, Shinomi-sama, Itou史, 中尾, and 木村ひさし.
As a special guest, the original cast was filled with love and said, "I love this movie! (played by West Island) 日村 is cool no matter what cut, whatever scene, whatever the ending".
 Seeing the photo makes the drinking party of 西島秀俊 so obvious!
The first day of the first stage of the 'Rengman School' was a welcome.
This is a painful story of a Yakuza, a leader of a group of non-profits who take over the rebuilding of a near-bankrupt university, solving a number of problems in a humble way.
The strong but unfeeling leader, Sita, and the number two day village of the Agibe-kun, who are always surrounded by family, are played by Sima.
West Island was "held in a state of tension until today" and had a very positive first day.
"Not only during the filming, but also after the filming, this team was so close together that they often met and talked about things", he says.
Ito also laughed, "There was a simple drink called a meditation session, with no reflection at all", and revealed that he spent precious time creating such a time, which was also a positive for the scene. Teamwork improved, motivation increased. It continued regularly afterwards, and there were many good memories".
In the conversation about the drinking party, the unexpected face of the West Island was revealed.
West Island admits that "they have been meditating with this member, drinking too much, and often don't remember half of it".
She cut off the "looking like a silly, unknown person" and, wondering, "Looks like a silly, but drunk? Is he really a good drunk?" and made the audience laugh.
It became a work that developed a good teamwork, with Sitama showing a willingness to "be a good name, maybe a series, with your help, we would like to work towards a series", with Itou saying "we are also eager to be a series", and the middle ending saying "I regretted watching the movie, Sitama was singing, but when it was a series, this time I wanted to sing".

Following the first nuclear accident in Fukushima, it became a matter of course to make the discussion about the continued pilot operation of the fishing industry off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, and the discussion on free operation by region, etc. more concrete.
During the 27th meeting of the Federation of Prefectural Fisheries Co-operatives (FCC) held at the Prefectural Water Workshop in Central Taipei, with the heads of the prefectures attending, Chairman Yuen Zhen said, "As prefectural fisheries unions, we believe there needs to be a movement towards free trade. We want each representative to be brought together and to start a discussion".
At the union's meeting, it was also approved to officially add the species of fish to the test fisheries, including the casagou, sakramas, and murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where the shipment restriction instructions were lifted.
The remaining fish products outside the scope of this section have been converted into two species of fish, the binosgai and the common cassava.
After the end, Chairman Yan Yan emphasized, in response to a press interview, that the start of the free-flowing operation was not yet known.
He said of the treated water after the purification of the contaminated water from the Fukushima I nuclear power plant, "The controversial debate is a problem. I am not opposed to ocean releases". He echoed the comments of former Minister of Environment and Mayor of Osaka City, Matsui Iharu.
In a discussion of the actual operation, the chairman of the Jiang Ka Chapter of the Yiching City Fisheries Co-operative noted that "the opinion needs to be drawn from below", and that he respected the wishes of the union members.
The local branch convenes a council of the local fisheries council, resolves each of the issues and reaches conclusions as a municipal fisheries council.
The head of the Samma Tbilisi Fisheries Association's Delta Management Association says that "in addition to fishermen, buyers need to be discussed".
The Somali Bipa fishing association, with the support of the country and the arrival of seven new vessels next year, said that "it is important to restore the catch first", and that it would work in parallel with the discussion of the full operation and the development of the environment.
Driving and smoking manners Street activities in downtown and tobacco sales associations uptown and downtown topics in the news
A union member who calls on the driver to drive safely = the morning field in the eastern city of Dongjin City
In conjunction with the "Autumn Prefectural People's Movement for Traffic Safety", the Association of Tobacco Sales in Dongzhin organized a street event on the 26th of July in the city square in front of the high street in the city of Ririnada, in the eastern city of Dongzhin.

"Beauty and ugliness" is a piece of paper?
The image of "snake" that is repeatedly portrayed by beautiful girls in the work is magnum opus.
What do mystical beauty and shadowy expressions have in common?
The '図ずお美少女コレクション' (玄光社) was launched in August 2019 and focuses on the beautiful girls portrayed by Mr. 図ずお, who has been known to have released a number of works since the 1950s and is the first person to be featured in the "horror manga".
As you take it in hand and look at it, you will notice the correlation between the "beauty" and "horror" of the work you are re-drawing.
Is it attractive because there is a "shadow"?
The five beautiful girls in the work.
The preface to the collection of "Beautiful Girls" included a line that said, "The shocking scenes and developments of the horror and ugliness of the story are distinguished by their contrasting beauty", but perhaps the more "horrible" is the contrast between the beautiful faces and the distorted, resentful, and hateful expressions.
Although the word "snake" is a keyword in many of the works of art, the way in which snakes are perceived by viewers as "unpleasant creatures" or as "beautiful" is different from the way in which they are perceived by those who feel "beautiful".
Some say the world likes reptiles, others say they are really bad.
Thus, the senses of the viewer can make "beauty" and "ugliness" appear to be "snake" in the face of a creature.
It is also revered as a spirit being with more spiritual powers than ever before, and the house where the "white serpent" lived is also a friendly place.
Among the sketches featuring the "snake" are the "Hypsies" and the "Two Girls" from the 1965 series "Mama's Hot!"
Usually, becoming a "white woman" is the stage where a beautiful woman with shadows is seen.
In a foolish way, can you say "cool beauty" type ... ... that feels like something that the beautiful girls in the sketches have in common?
In any case, while the main character of the "Fox" series, which has been serialized in Weekly Young Sunday since 1969, is a beautiful girl character, a symbol of the art of drawing, she is a symbol of the "Snakes" - a group of people who are often referred to as "Snakes" - who are often referred to as "Snakes" because they sleep deeply every hundred years to maintain their eternal life and youth.
Seven foreign students of Saviel High were honoured by the mayor of the city by the daily newspaper of the Ministry of Information, Media and Web.

The students, talking about what they want to do during their stay, and others, were encouraged by Mayor Fujita to lead meaningful school lives.

A circle of "children's dining rooms" that provide free or cheap meals to children across the country.
According to surveys by NGOs and corporations, this year there are about 3,700 businesses operating nationwide.
In the same period, there were 24 houses in Fukuoka Prefecture, which were up by 1.6 times from 2018 and up by 9 houses last year.
Why is there no children's dining room now?
The social activist and chairman of the board of directors of NPO, Mr. Tussauds, spoke about the background and meaning of the lecture in the city of Sakai.
The aging of children has made communities miss, and the shopping street has been in decline.
People no longer had a place to meet.
"There was a need for a local exchange point where people and people could interact".
▼ The children's dining room is a "multigenerational exchange point" where older people also participate.
Not only will it eliminate malnutrition, but it will also lead to child support and better health for the elderly.
Breaking the poverty chain, rebuilding the community.
The key is "not to create children who start from there".
From the 1st of January to the one where the daily meals are served varies.
The size varies from a few to hundreds of people, and the venue varies widely from private homes to temples.
There is a growing atmosphere where people can do what they want.
The low level of such a plot is charming.
It's just difficult to ensure the management and staffing of the business.
Sometimes you hear about issues such as a secure management system.
▼ However, "Connecting with many people changes values" and "connecting with society becomes a safety net in the event of disasters and other disasters", says Ms. Tussauds.
It seems to be a beacon of hope in a closed society.

The "real prisoner" who drones attacked a Saudi oil facility (FRIDAY) - Yahoo! news
"The Iranian-made drone Ababir, used in this bombing, has improved its performance dramatically in recent years by analyzing the crashed U.S. military drone.
It is possible to produce cheaply, and the range is about 1,000 km.
It's also a powerful tool to fly low in the air, enough to be captured by radar". (Yokadachi, press photographer)
On September 14, the oil facility of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudia Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after, the Yemeni opposition organization "Houthi" issued a statement.
"The Houthis are undoubtedly behind Iran, led by President Rouhani.Iran, in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil, cannot allow the rival Saudi Arabia to stockpile crude oil.The goal is to inform the international community that if Iran continues to impose a ban on crude oil, there will be pain in response". (International Political Analyst, Dr. H.R.H.E.U.)
Following the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production stopped, and crude oil prices skyrocketed by 15 percent.
Still, there are rumors that the oil shock will return.
"Whether Trump is promising a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's election, he wants to avoid military intervention in any way. Once that is realized, Iran will continue to bomb the Houthis undercover with drones.
The "proxy war" between the United States and Iran is in a crisis of one-shot.
The reason a super-personal YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Ask the hired president about the business.
9/27 (金) 8:47 delivery
YouTuber, now a hugely popular youth-focused YouTuber, is now a huge hit.
While it is not uncommon for companies to use the term to advertise their products, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber Recruitment" that employs regular employees in their own companies.
The company's direct marketing mix, which is the main business of corporate CRM (Customer Relationship Management), is the company's direct marketing mix (hereinafter: DMMiX).
What does "hire a YouTuber" really mean?
I interviewed Mr. Sholin Yuuki, who is the Managing Director of DmMiX and, this time, is actually the representative of the subsidiary and first staff of YouTuber hired.
I want to support young people who are working hard to get YouTuber recruitment.
― What is the first step in "YouTuber adoption"?
小林祐樹: Now the career of YouTuber is the dream of many young people.
Junior students are also ranked in the top position in the career rankings they want to pursue, and more and more young people will be pursuing their career in the future.
So far, our company has been hiring and supporting young people who are pursuing their dreams, such as band members and comedians.
Similarly, "YouTuber adoption" is about hiring and supporting young people who are pursuing their dream of becoming YouTubers.
- YouTuber has an image of an individual posting videos on their own, but why did you think of "adopting" him?
Jon: While many young people are passionate about the career of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers are not making the income they thought they would.
There are few creators who work and post videos while working, or their families who refuse to acknowledge the existence of being a YouTuber.
In this effort, the hired creators are paid and provided an environment for content creation.
We hope to support the activity by supporting the demerit of the career of YouTuber, which at first becomes unstable.
Environmental girl "fighting for a safe future" protested around the world for two weeks straight.
On 27th, Greta Tunbury took part in a protest in Montreal, Canada's east coast.
A Swedish girl who is campaigning against global warming, Greta Tunbury, took part in a protest in Montreal on the 27th, emphasizing that she "will continue to fight for a safe future".
The youth protest of this day has spread to Asian countries and to the rest of the world, including Europe and the United States.
A massive protest, in response to Ms. Greta's call, continued for two weeks straight for 20 days.
Greta met with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau on the 27th.
Mr. Trudo, who has always appealed for a strong stance on climate change, also took part in the march.
But after the meeting, Greta was bitter about Mr. Toldo, saying "obviously there is a lack of action".
"South Korea wishes to return to GSAMIA". - Yahoo! news
Nipper, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Korean-Japanese Affairs, said in a separate interview with the Japan News at the U.S. Ambassador's official residence in Seoul on Jan. 27, that "We hope that Korea will reconsider and return its decision to dissolve the military information in South Korea, including the protection agreement (GSOMIA) that expires on Nov. 23".
It is unusual for a senior US official to mention a GSOMIA bankruptcy review.
GSOMIA is the basis for the agreements signed by Japan, Japan, and Korea to share missile launch information.
If South Korea breaks the agreement with Japan in August, the notification of its termination would break the framework for protecting military information in South Korea.
Napper argues that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis".
"There is time until the ban is lifted", he urged the return of South Korea.
The Joint Flight Training conducted by 中露 in July over the Japanese Sea also showed a "first-in-history" recognition of the threat and stressed that "it is essential that the US-South Korea, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, continue to work together in alliance relations".
He noted that today's deteriorating relations between South Korea and the United States "harm the national interests of the United States".
"There is no intention of mediation", he said, "and South Korea will play a positive role in filling the gap".

The critical accident at Tohoku Village, 30 days and 20 years ago, nuclear power plant problems3 hundred items: Hokkaido News
In the first time in Japanese nuclear history, the deaths from the outbreak occurred in the critical incident in the village of Tōhikai, Tatsui Prefecture, in the year 2000 to the year 18 after the critical incident, there were 336 reports of accidents and malfunctions at nuclear-related facilities nationwide, according to an interview with the Nuclear Regulatory Agency on 28 July.
It's been 20 years since the critical accident that sounded the alarm to the nuclear industry's safety myth, 30 days after the crash.
Although the international assessment scale for depth (INES) is not of safety importance) and the non-evaluated cases account for about 90 percent, the report is continually called for to raise awareness of safety, taking the lesson from the same accident and the Fukushima nuclear accident of Tokyo Electric Power in 2011.
He is completing the story and original drawings of the picture book and collecting donations for publication.
In a local artistic collaboration in the city of Watashi Prefecture, 福井 Prefecture, artist Zongda Light started a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds online to publish creative artwork inspired by the legend of the prefecture.
Originally from Hokkaido, who started working as a team member in April of this year, Ms. Zongada is determined to "convey the kindness of the people of Fukutai through picture books based on a deeply held belief".
 Donations are here to convey the heart of 福井.
While she is active as an artist working on mathematical-motivated contemporary art, she has also been a collaborator since the turn of the century.
After working on the development of the Naga, Kumbang, and Kyu, he took over the city of Watanabe in April this year.
The aim of the project is to create a picture book in the name of the same city where the Kaguri-ku, or Yatsuma, created the first such artworks.
Living in the city, Mr. Zongda said he was "amazed at the depth of compassion around him that I first saw".
One of the highlights of the city's legendary "face of the bride's ghost" is the legend.
The story of a kind wife who, against her demon-possessed mother-in-law, continues to chant the fasting to help her daughter-in-law without worrying about being surprised on the face.
"Forget the hatred, return it with kindness and kindness. I felt the depth of faith and kindness of the people of Fukui".
Taking a hint, Ms. Zongada turned to the original picture book, began interviewing early on, including attending the Gizaki Shrine in Owaru City, and completed the story "Oru no Ghost" featuring a kindly ghostly couple and a boy.
From June onwards, he used his current job to paint 10 scenes in warm watercolor and to prepare the material for the book.
In addition, using the traditional craftsmanship and paper that has been inhabited by the city, the cover of the picture book will be made from paper.
Reading, reading, etc. gives parents the opportunity to enjoy the paper handshake.
The goal of donating 600 copies of the book is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is until October 25th.
Ms. Zongada said, "The spirit of Fukuda, who grew up in a historic Buddhist culture, is a pride of the whole country.
I want to convey to children through picture books what is the real kindness, compassion, and heart that is passed down through the heart".
福井 prefecture has identified 11 regional revitalization projects selected by cooperatives and operators in the prefecture, and is one of the projects that 福井 prefecture is supporting using the tax credits.

Increased consumption, increased taxation, frequent visitors to retail stores in Osaka Prefecture, and sales of merchandise:
Sales of large appliances before taxes were good at the store in front of the Big Camera Okama Station.
On the 28th day of the last weekend before the 8% to 10% excise tax increase, family members rushed to shops in shops and supermarkets in Osaka Prefecture.
There are home centers that develop specialty retail outlets primarily for purchases, and there are also clothing stores that sell winter clothing in advance, each with a strong push to sell.
At Bickamera Okama Station, a sale was launched that posted a price cap for a period of 30 days.
A man from the same city who worked in the store looking for a refrigerator said, "It's not easy to ignore the fact that 2% is expensive".
According to the same store, the number of large appliances such as TVs, washing machines, refrigerators and other appliances that have grown since September has nearly doubled in sales from the previous year.
"The rush is more than imagined. Late in the day, customers who are looking for high-end goods will show up".
The sale, which is labelled as "tax-increased direct-to-tax disposal", is being conducted by the suit sales department.
Coats have been sold since early September, a month earlier than usual, and sales this month are up 10% year-on-year.
A businessman who visited the store to buy adult-style suits is quoted as saying, "The ceremony is still early, but I want to buy it before taxes go up".
The tax increase will be reduced to a tax-reduced tax system that will allow for taxation of drinks and food items, and will be limited to everyday items and alcohol in home centers and supermarkets.
At the Time High House store in Home Center, a special corner with large-capacity laundry and tissue containers will be developed near the entrance.
Sales of everyday consumer goods increased by 1.6 times the monthly average from the previous year, "unless you replenish them several times a day, they will be cut off" (Chinsheng Shi)
The man, a city official, who came to the store, was "purchasing some kitchen paper for this occasion, so I'm sure it's something to buy".
The Tianmenhoha Happytown, Osaka-nan, will also have a carriage packed with detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, and other items.
A man from the same city who worked in the same company (35) had said that "if you get a cashless payment point refunded, the burden will change almost nothing, and you won't rush to buy everyday goods".

After the award ceremony for 'The Best', the German commander and I assert that "I never imagined anything so wonderful. I am very satisfied and proud to have won this award. It was a wonderful few days for me. I was able to win thanks to my players. The most important thing is the team".
"What can we say about him? he has won many titles. his team's style of play is extraordinary. he is the best manager I have ever faced, and it is an honor to be nominated and to be able to compete with him".
It also mentions the director Pochettino and Tottenham.
"His last year was incredibly amazing. In many cases, people won't remember him unless he won a title. He built a team little by little and played in a great style".
Klopp is not missing out on the best moment of 2019: " (CL) is the turning point in Barcelona. (CL) Many professionals and myself would not have bet a cent on us. (CL) with a 3-0 win against a team with Messi and Sures. . . it's like a death sentence. . . We could have taken a small chance and made it happen. . . . I couldn't believe it. Looking back, you might say we beat CL in this game. . . . this game will be remembered by all".
Finally, Cropp, who was asked a more personal question, concludes: "When I congratulated the Bundesliga champions, I woke up on a bench, not even knowing where I was. This time, that never happened. I don't like to get drunk because I'm a person who is plagued by the compulsive notion of self-management.
LexusLC and IS have a special specification car that has been put into the hands of artisans to cutting-edge technology.
It is finished with a special one that enhances the style and taste even more.
Lexus has set up a special specification for the luxury coupé "LC" and sports sedan "IS" and will launch on October 1.
 Photography Interior of the Lexus LLC which stands out for its high quality
The special-purpose vehicle was developed on the basis of the idea of "CRAFTED".
CRAFTED is a Japanese sense of beauty, cultivated in rich nature and history, and a sense of unspoken searching for the vague, which embodies the desire to drive the mind, to use all methods, from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology, to create a new, mind-blowing experience.
The LC's special-purpose Patina Elegance is based on the LC500/LC500h and uses a leather steering system using Lexus's highest-end LeatherL-ANILINE sheet, which combines durability with soft and natural winds while delivering a smooth and natural feel.
She finished as a model that further elevated style and taste.
L-ANILINE selects only the highest quality raw leather, achieving softness with a color coat aimed at a thin coating using a long-term flexibility engineering and unique technology.
The body is surrounded by a seated position and a feeling of fitness while walking upwards.
Steering also uses premium lasers, and insists on making the skin feel good.
Other items were specially equipped such as a metalworking with an arc-encrusted ceiling, laser etching, scarf plates with L-shaped motifs, and colored head-up displays.
The interior uses a combination of bright brown patina and special-purpose car colors, combined with a door trim, leather sheet, seat belt.
Also, the color of the stitch uses two colors of light brown and dark brown of varying brightness, matching the stiff texture, and represents a space of superior quality and depth.
The body color is a three-color setup of special specification vehicle-only settings, including railway car mechanics, sonic titanium, graphite black glass frames.
I'd like to use a sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina will also be available in mid-October.
The exact date is not disclosed, but it may be delivered on October 4th.
 View the full pictureCan macOS Catalina be released on October 4?
The above image is from the Apple website in Denmark, which has been updated.
The image certainly has the words "From October 4th to October 4th") on it.
The official website also has a high accuracy of information.
By the way, personally, the most I'd like to try out of macOS Catalina is the Sidecar sidecar.
This is a feature that deals with the iPad as a Mac sub-display, a feature that was previously realized in a third-party app.
And since Sidecar is a pure Apple feature, it is expected to be superior in completeness and responsiveness.
There are also rumors of a sequel, MacBook Pro, with a 16-inch display, but first, I would like to experience this next generation of macOS on storage.
The growth process of Sakraebi, the city of Shikoku, etc., PT, water depths of 290 meters, was photographed by Shikoku News at the Atse.
This year's born Sakraebi, who was successful in shooting in the deep sea of the Bay of Pigs, is born in the shore of the shark-infested area of Shikoku City (provided by the Sakraebi Project).
The "Project by Biasakrabi" of the Council of the Marine Industry Cluster of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, including the city of Shimizu, thus succeeded in capturing the Sackrabi, which is believed to have been born during the spring-summer fertility period this year, at a depth of 290 meters in the waters of the Bay of Pigs.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the researchers want to link it to an ecological explanation of the mystery of the sacraea.
The filming was done near the seabed about 1.5 kilometers off the coast of the same city's freshwater zone.
In 17 minutes, we confirmed about 300 of them.
The traditional view that the deep-sea sacraevi "form a certain herd under the sea" during the day was reaffirmed.
The adult was about 40 millimeters long, the reflected individual about 23 millimeters long.
The water-fried sakrabi identified a period of fertilization by comparing it with seasonal data.
Detailed analysis is requested from the team's foxtoon software technologies and shikoyama industrial technology specialist school.
The project leader of Hiro野恵介 says that he "wants to capture a vivid picture of the individual's growth process, including the infant".

The first half of the Bad Five-Wheel Race is a step forward for world champion Tereshida Shengyu, who is in good shape!
<Men's singles>(Bad×Spy!
The Japanese team, which won six medals at the Big Event in Badminton in August, the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, will compete in the Chinese Open (OOP) starting on 17 September, after completing their reinforced residency in early September.
Here, looking back at the first half of the race, which began in May and ran from August to the start of the Tokyo Five-Age next year, we look forward to the men's singles for the mid-table race (September to December).
The Badminton Five-Around Race, which began in May, eliminated the top four events in which the top players would compete at the end of the World Championships.
The only ones who kept up the good run in the first half were the two Taiwanese wrestlers (Teng Chen Chow) and Tenshiyu Tenshi, who won two of the four tournaments.
桃田 won the World Championship, which ended on Sunday with the Indonesia OP ((S1000) and the "World Ranking Points" which are directly linked to the five-wheel race.
桃田 also makes Japan OP (S750) as well.
The tournament, which has been contested since May, is the fourth edition of the Sudirman Cup (May/China) tournament, Indonesia (July/results) 16 strong (July) Japan (July) World Championship (August).
Although fewer than other top players, the schedule has been a reduction in body weight.
Just because it was only the first World Championship in August, there would be no greater fatigue than during the war.
The top conference will be looking for a good result in a series of mid-season games from September onwards.
Taiwanese ace who is also a fierce fighter.
Pay attention to the young Thai players!
Similarly, the winner of the top-level Indonesia OP and TaiOP ((S500) tournaments, Sandee Jang, has already competed in seven tournaments.
He also competed in the local Taipei OP ((S300) in September and won the event as a judge.
Originally a physically strong, non-aggressive athlete who doesn't struggle.
As long as the conference continues, there is no major problem with the game's performance.
Rather, having scored high points in the first half would have made it easier to adjust the schedule of future games.
The team had the impression that until last year it lacked explosive power, but this year, with the increased sense of stability on the pitch, it was able to maintain solid performance.
For the world's No. 1 cherry, he will be a more difficult opponent than ever.
Apart from these two players, the first half results were left behind by Thai youth Ace Cantaphone and Indian Cy Pranice B.
And three players from Anders Antonesen who are fighting alone as a European force.
Although Cantaphone did not advance to the final in the top competition, they are still trying to win the top spot, including the best four in the second competition this season.
There is still a rough side to it: a 20-year-old who can now ride on top of the top players (age 21 on the 18th) is said to have great potential to make a leap in the five-wheeler race.
Cy Pranice B. also took a step forward in India, where singles have been a great success.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and the injured backward Srikanthi Kidambi will not only keep up, but also the Indian movement after the Mid-Autumn War will need to be taken seriously.
New mobile phone prices - lower prices in fair competition: Hokkaido News
A new mobile phone company's fare plan has been introduced, which will be implemented with the amendment of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
But generally, it has become a high-stakes one.
The head of the Housing Authority, Zhao Wei, said last summer that "there is room for a 40% drop", but despite the growing expectations of a price cut, there was no price competition.
The intrinsic entry of the company has been delayed, and the monopoly of the big three companies has continued to be a major factor.
Fair competition would make it desirable for consumers to have an easy-to-use pricing system.
I would like to call on the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits the discounting of sets of end-generation and communications fees.
Because instead of selling the end-generation for a low price, the communication fee was set to be cut higher.
Softbank and KDDI have announced plans to increase the maximum and half price of their phones.
But both companies will be unable to connect for 100 days, so SIM-Lock will be able to access the terminal.
NTTDKOMO will only offer up to one third of its end-generation to subscribers of its own wireless services.
All three companies appear to be continuing a "surge" to prevent them from switching to other companies.
The Prime Minister's Office has stated that the SIM lock will be immediately removed.
The corporate side needs to respond quickly.
The extension of the Sky is due to the fact that the maintenance of communications networks such as the base station did not go as planned.
The dress is a shoulder-length, but it was only expected to be a competitive trigger for price reduction.
Was there any sweetness in the sight of the world?
The start date and fee for the full service has not been disclosed.
As a company with social infrastructure, I want you to do business responsibly.
This change in the rate was prompted by the statement of the Director of the Office of the Registrar.
Mr. Liu expressed dissatisfaction with the new tariffs of the three companies, saying that "I think the competition will start from now on. I have no intention of staying that way".
But I don't think "official price cuts" will distort the market, promote healthy competition.
Businesses should be competing at the customer level before they are outrun by the government.
The pricing systems of companies are very complex, not easy to compare.
While the end-user advertises "the maximum half price" and there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half the price, the Consumer Agency has drawn attention.
Businesses themselves must focus on providing a polite and easy-to-understand explanation so as not to create misunderstandings among users.
The cash limit for the three credit cards in the three provinces has been lowered to 500,000 yen.
Three credit bonds in the Three Prefectures (Sansum Triple Credit Bank, North Ise Up Credit Bank, and North Kyushu Credit Bank) announced on 26th that they have decided to reduce the cash card limit to avoid special fraud.
For depositors over the age of 70, who have a triple-name, a northern Isobel, a northern Yibun, a cash card holder at each credit card bank in the North, and have not made any withdrawal transactions with ATMs (cash ATMs) for the past three years, the maximum amount of cash withdrawal per day with a cash card is 500,000 yen.
The three-tiered credit union of San and North Izzo will take effect on October 1, and the credit union of North Korea will take effect on November 1.
In the province, there are a number of special cases of ATM fraud involving fraud involving cash card and security numbers, including financial institutions and police, and credit card bank officials say they "want to protect your valuable deposits as much as possible".
The transfer to the back room of the family was followed by the sudden death of the parents.
Japan Sumo Association announced on 27 July that it had approved the transfer of three male gymnasts from the Yukon Tōronkai Sumo Room, one male bedshan, to the back room following the death of their father.
The ground floor is the same as the cellar room.
The Master's first cousin, who was from the Shiloh Chamber, was the brother of the deceased.
The family passed away on the 16th, and the dragons were a temporary specimen of the same mirrored room, and further treatment was being discussed.
In the back room, there are 12 male moles as of the autumn location, with 10 moles from Mongolia, as well as the dragons.
The overseas wave of "insulting and degrading play" has drawn on the "face-to-face risk tactics" of American players.
The USFL's Raffleplay, former England representative, "can't be called a tackle".
The World Cup was held in Japan on 26 June, and the United States, which made its last appearance in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England.
Black Star has been advancing, but the late NFL's John Quill-starring roughplay is calling for a wave.
He was forced to withdraw in a way that would add a shoulder to his face.
The overseas media have released live footage of the actual scene, and the former England international has also made the complaint that "the game is insulting and disgraceful" and "is not a tackle".
 Videos  "Offensive and despicable play" and overseas ripples!
In a back-and-forth, a riot of military players... the actual moment of "facial hazard tactics" played by U.S. Representative Quill.
The fierce fighters have crossed a line.
It's the 29th minute of the second half, 0-38 down.
The deeply antagonistic and English-language general Farrell was somewhat out of balance as he caught his side pass.
It was Quill who went to tackle this.
He simply raised his upper body rather than lower than upper, and hit his upper half hard.
The result is a head-and-head contact, a head-pumping effect.
Farrell was hit hard and fell.
An Englishman protested vigorously against a player trying to push a quill into a game that was clearly unjustified.
The two athletes of the military gathered together, and the air became instantaneous.
As a result, Quill was able to return to the field with a red card.
The pitch was left with a bad face, but some of the audience asking for fair play also asked for a bowing.
Rugby's strongholds in New Zealand's local media "staff" are featured with the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players withdrawing with a low play, England win fast".
"Kill made a humble shoulder charge on the face of England's star player Farrell and retired", reports The Daily Mail. "It was almost a brawl between players from both armies".
In the article, the former England international commentator and commentator Ugo Monea made a comment.
"It's insulting, mean, it's not what you call a tackle, it's a mean play".
The United States, who were one game short of the other, narrowly missed out on a knockout loss in the 81st minute of the home-and-away tie.
But Quill's play left a bad taste behind.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health and Labour published for the first time the names of the 424 hospitals judged to be "poor in clinical performance" among 1,455 public hospitals and public hospitals across the country, such as Sun Red.
In 福井 Prefecture, the Ministry of Labour and Social Work reviewed the treatment performance of 14 public hospitals in 福井, and four facilities in 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井, 福井
⇒ Four hospitals to be reorganized are "not up to par".
To curb the expanding medical costs of aging, and to promote the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing regions, we have taken exceptional action.
In October, the hospital was asked to review the restructuring and integration in detail and to draw a conclusion by September of the following year.
No force of law is in place, but the concern that nearby hospitals will be lost will lead to a reaction from local chiefs and residents.
It was made public at the same meeting.
The targeted hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, with relatively few beds.
Other than the prefectures of the same city, the percentage was higher in the order of: 新
The number of targets was 54 on the Hokkaido Highway, the highest, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from 2017, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs surveyed 1,455 hospitals in public and private hospitals that could accommodate "highly acute periods" for patients with severe conditions, "highly acute periods" for general surgery.
Analyzing clinical outcomes in nine areas, including cancer and emergency care, and whether competing hospitals are "less than 20 minutes away by car", the researchers determined the need to publish hospital names.
The hospitals to be targeted will be asked to consider discontinuing or moving some clinical departments to other hospitals.
Healthcare costs will increase sharply in the next 25 years, when the entire generation of the block is over the age of 75.
The Ministry of Labour therefore sets a target of reducing the number of hospital beds with 1246 thousand beds across the country to 1191 thousand beds.
Today, while nurses are well-equipped and have a high number of "high-rehabilitation" and "acute-care" beds, the high-needs rehabilitation of the elderly is inadequate.
To cope with ageing, not only should the number of beds be reduced, but more beds for rehabilitation are needed.
In the field of hospital reorganization and integration, the Metropolitan Municipality has developed a "regional health plan" that sets out the number of beds needed in 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 regions and is being discussed by municipalities and healthcare professionals, many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and the debate is difficult to navigate.
The Ministry of Labour and Employment is trying to stimulate the debate by publishing the names of hospitals that are not doing well.

A hundred thousand students are protesting against climate change demonstrations in Vancouver, with school holidays and students appealing for warming measures.
Around 100,000 students, centered around fellow student Greta Tumbery, a 16-year-old environmental activist, marched in Vancouver City on September 27 to call for climate action.
A look at the climate demonstration in Vancouver.
The march was held from Vancouver City Hall, across Cambridgeshire Bridge, to the downtown library.
People with signs began to gather in front of the town hall where the meeting was held, hours before the start, so many people that at 1 p.m. the start time filled the road a few blocks from the town hall.
Since then, the number of participants has continued to grow, eventually reaching more than 100,000.
On the road, police also enforced road regulations, cooperating and guarding for several hours until everyone was finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, Vancouver has hosted a number of events focusing on warming since last weekend.
On the last 27 days of the school strike, the school held a strike called "Fridays for Future".
Students who took time off from school on this day appealed to adults to "save the planet even when we take time off from school", and many adults who took time off from work were seen responding, "We will also do our best for the future of children who are serious about learning".
Pig cholera vaccine recommended region9 prefecture  farm water province (www.gifnews.com) - Yahoo! news
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on 27th published a draft of the Epidemic Guidelines, which would allow for the prevention of vaccination against currently unauthorized farmed pigs, to prevent the spread of the infection of the animal diseases "pig (cholera) ".
The policy will select the target area, nine provinces, including the province of Aichi, where the infection in pigs and wild boars has been confirmed.
The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the territory, but allows the movement of refined meat and processed products outside the territory.
We aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible, by public comment to the public.
By allowing the use of vaccines and the extra-territorial circulation of pork, such as pork, it could affect pork exports rather than the "clean country" recognized by international organizations.
Since the September attacks, Japan has been temporarily suspended from the status of a clean country.
In the proposed amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water, based on expert opinion, set up "recommended vaccination areas" for areas with a high risk of infection from wild boar to pig.
The respective Metropolitan Municipality will create a "vaccination program" that includes the scope, period, number, and procedure of vaccination, and will be approved by the same province and allowed to be used by the governor.
The other seven provinces listed as recommended for vaccination are 玉, Fu山, Shiikawa, Fugai, Nagano, Triple, Shiga.
When guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and make a decision.
The movement of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, waste materials, etc. is, in principle, restricted within the territory.
For the sake of refined meat and processed products, the flow restrictions are not subject to the costs or impact on farmers, but are actually allowed to flow outside the territory.
To prevent the spread of the virus, we thoroughly process food waste.
It will also appeal to the safety of vaccinated pigs and to work to prevent damage to reputation.
The proposed amendments to the guidelines were drafted at a conference of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Epidemic Control Office.
The city will continue to monitor and comment publicly on the prefecture until October 7, and will implement new guidelines for the prevention of the epidemic.
No one belongs to the Honda Guyu, open approach to MANU!
"Please make an offer. No money needed" (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (土) 2:57 delivery
Withdrawing from the Australian A-League's Melbourne Victory last season, MF Benda Guyuyu, a former Japanese player who is now without a club, has taken an amazing turn.
视频本田圭佑, was he actually in the game?
The truth of heaven will be revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account late on Sunday, July 27, has taken a public approach to a club, saying, "Please offer.
The one who sent the "counter-offer" was Manchester United, the world famous team.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the Premier League's strongest club?
The motivation is in an article in the Australian edition of FOX Sports, which was published on the 24th.
In an article titled "Five FWs Manchester United are likely to catch in the crisis of injury continuation", five non-affiliated players were picked up who are currently available.
Among players like Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, Wilfred Bonny, and others, Honda's name was also mentioned.
United are currently facing injuries from MF Paul Pogba, DFLuke Show, DFERIC BYLY, FW Anthony Marshall, FW Marcus Rushford and are in a state of emergency.
The Red Devils, led by manager Ole Gunner-Sulshar, are facing a challenge to their front-line quality, having to face a two-win, 22-loss and difficult skating streak in the league.
It was then that Honda was named by the Haohsiung Media as a candidate for the new battle force for the Teco-Too.
The article analyzed that "Bonda's contract as a player on the creative side, not the strikers, can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling".
While 18 games and 9 points at the Melbourne Victory were "a solid record", it was also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to move away from his hobby of managing the Cambodian national team, to get full attention".
Does Honda's approach work?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for the veterans who will be making the Tokyo Five-Around announcement next year as a goal and a public statement.
500 portable translators have been installed, the stores have been loansed free of charge, and the stores are available at the Shikoku News and Entertainment Center.
A portable translation machine, "PocketTalk", is lending free of charge to 500 locations, including stores in the city of 浜松.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced on 26th that it has completed the installation of 500 of these machines in stores in the city of Hamamatsu, among others, in a project to loan free portable translation machines "PocketTalk" to member businesses.
It is noted that the concentration of the same translator in the same region will lead to an increase in the responsiveness of the first-in-the-nation, inbound travellers.
The loans and the previous versions contained 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
The city centre is 60% of the city.
The map app also began showing loans to Google Maps, making it possible to locate "foreign language stores" on smartphones.
It can be accessed from the website of the tourist area of Lake Hamana.
The free loan of 74 languages, which is available in the city, was launched in April as part of a nine-member initiative by nine local organizations that received the proclamation "Hama松, Japan's best inbound support city".
The Chamber will lend the 500 units to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of 500 units, hospitality certification, cashless settlement, and other requirements for two years.
A spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce said that "it is important to attract new foreign customers in a difficult business environment".
And right-handed celebrity  Now池村寛世 does not need a tip?
Today's best shot by Miss Cady.
A 1W shot is not necessarily a tipping shot.
There is also the so-called "right-down" technique of hitting the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance with the second stroke of Par 5, etc.
The latest 1W also carries a high head volume and the risk of scattering the ball, but there are players who practice this frequently on the field.
The first tour victory awaits池村寛世.
The 24-year-old, a professional 7th, is currently 7th in the Driving Distance category with a height of 166cm and a small handle.
While the long shot was a must, one of the challenges was fairwaywood accuracy.
"Spoon 3W shot was bad at the beginning of the spring, so I thought we'd try straight drawing".
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of the Tiarea with pottery, and the ball is also rotated at 1W.
While the big carries are often used in cases where the tip is required, both sides make good use of the straight draw on narrow holes and so on.
"It can be used in a hallway where the eyelids are slanted downwards".
The ballistic meter recorded 270yd280yd on a carrier.
"So you don't need 3W. I'm sure Caddy can be more comfortable with a straight-through than 3W".
From the June "Japan Tour Championship", wood in a carriage bag has only 1W.
The second longest club is the 17 degree UT loft.
The tactics, which even the touring bandmates are surprised by, are the joy of the admiration that leaks from the gallery they have seen.
This is "to move the club to a level (level) level".
"I don't fly straight, downblown, up, or down, but I'm going to the right as a cutter. I was originally playing straight-dressing to correct the swing of a 1W shot at tip-off.
While the ball is not caught, there is a risk of slicing, "so the left side can be removed (not curved to the left) ".
I'm going to tell Canton but... I don't think it's a professional skill.

Greta Tunbery asked on Twitter why adults mock and threaten children.

While the speech is being watched, there are rumors that insult Ms. Greta.
 Tweet集 Gretha Tunbery: "Why do adults laugh at and threaten children?"
The television station, which was quoted by a political commentator as saying that Greta was "mentally ill" on an American television show, and was being used by her parents and international left-wingers, apologized.
Even in Japan, there are many online publications about Greta that criticize parts of her speech that are not in the content of the statement, such as "used and cute".
Meanwhile, Greta posted on her Twitter account on September 26th, "Why do adults spend time mocking and threatening teenagers and children?"
"I'm coming up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as I can think of".
"Look, it's starting again", Greta began posting, "as you can see, people who hate me are always active. They chase me around for my looks, my clothes, my attitude, and where I'm different from people. They come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as they can think of".
And he pointed out that adults seem to be making a fuss about the topic because they don't want to deal with the climate or environmental crisis, and he continued:
Why adults spend time mocking and threatening teenagers and children, I honestly don't understand.
I'm sure you can do another good thing at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But, no longer waste your time paying attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Change is coming.
Whether or not adults like the change, they will.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday, the 20th of last week, strikes against climate change were held in New York and around the world.

A wedge shot of Galicia.
I thought I could go at that pace in the second half, but I was disappointed that the pattern didn't work out well.
- Did you see the winner in Eagle 6 and Burdy 7?
Even after hitting a bogie on the 4th, there was still a par5 left, so if I was doing it with a sense of return, the Chip-In-Eagle on the 6th came to me.
In the seventh, Bardi was given a chance to win, but I regretted not being able to extend in the second half.
- What did you get at this conference?
The recent shots were not as good, so it was good that the Fairway was able to keep a tight track.
I had little experience, so I studied quite a bit, as the race was a course that changed in order and in reverse, with a beat and distance.
- What's the difference from the usual convention?
It was possible to take a camera (such as a mobile phone) somewhere.
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was pretty much video-making.
Not much changed except that, as the tournament was co-hosted with few Japanese players, I came to the game feeling "you can't beat foreign players".
The second half will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you shouldn't be aiming for the gold medal, but I would like to win another one, as soon as there is a ZOZO championship, so I will try to get to the top of the conference and qualify for the competition.
What is the best way to prevent developing dementia and keep it to the point of "forgetting"?
取材・文/渡辺陽(わたなべ・よう) 
Drugs for dementia are thwarting major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals by challenging research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is being explored, and it has been discovered that it is possible to keep it to a very mild, forgetful level.
Recently I heard a conversation from Professor D Junov of the University Hospital Stroke Center.
 Dementia is not going away 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
From mild to severe, no matter the degree of severity, everyone can develop dementia as they age.
But it is thought that developing a new drug for dementia will take more than 20 years.
Even the drug, commonly used in Japan, known as Donepezil, which is already out of coverage in some countries overseas, cannot be expected to have a significant cure.
On the other hand, while the number of deaths from infections and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased with the dramatic advances in cancer treatments, such as anti-cancer drugs, people have been able to live longer.
This is also the reason why there is a growing number of people with dementia.
We need to create an environment in which people can live in peace and security in the region, not just for themselves or their families, but for society as a whole.
How to keep things "forgotten"

Although the development of dementia is inevitable, it is possible to reduce symptoms as much as possible and keep them to a "forgetfulness" level.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle disorder and tends to be more prone to it.
First, people with metabolism are more likely to develop dementia.
Dementia is considered one of the most common lifestyle disorders.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It will have a significant impact on economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where food stamps are distributed to the poor, but food stamps are preserved frozen burgers, pizza, and chicken.
It can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot use gas or electricity, and who cannot cook in the first place.
Then we become a vegetarian and protein-poor diet, a lifestyle of fat and sugar.
Eventually, poverty and obesity will lead to a lot of television watching and a lack of physical freedom.
A similar situation may occur in Japan.
And those who don't think, work, or do other things are more likely to develop dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, we need to read books every day, not be a metaphor, but think about things.
