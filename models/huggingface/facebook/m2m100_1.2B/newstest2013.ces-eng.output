The Republican Party's Strategy Against Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders have justified their policy with the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, describes such fraud as a myth with the fact that electoral fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after a lightning strike.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the U.S. over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the United States, federal elections are held by states.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that make the process of election or listing difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican deputies in 26 states were added.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote were submitted in 41 states in 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the voter list on the day of the elections, and deprive citizens of the right to vote in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Indian Act was ratified by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, 34 states have supported proposals for such laws to force voters to submit photo ID cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not possess a photo ID issued by their state government agency.
Moreover, about five million new voters did not have such a passport in 2012.
Purchasing the required ID card in addition often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions unreasonably affect young people, members of minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that is not all.
Students who are known as voters for their inclination toward democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID card issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose rather Republican candidates to use cards issued by those clubs in the election.
Until 2004, no country required a citizenship certificate for elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have passed laws that require voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 endorsed laws in eight states that disregard voter registration on election day.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million people.
Measures taken after 2009, however, caused a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, Afro-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, despite only 13% of African-American voters in that state.
It was the same with the Spaniards.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters were very strongly opposed to passing laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even intervened.
The damage was partially reduced.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID card.
However, the new rules will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the bias of the passed laws and see them as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states where these laws were passed accounted for 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is already certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo examination or not?
The PSA test yielded sometimes false results, which were false negative or even false positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this even increased the hesitation of men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the U.S. have shown high levels of contamination among individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who did not go to the examination had a 30-40% higher risk of developing metastases.
So I recommend testing from age 50 or from age 40 if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are indifferent.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which has no long-term impact on life, and focus in these cases on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Instead, we will offer them active surveillance and offer treatment in case of disease progression.
More and more accurately we set criteria to help you decide which type to treat and which not.
However, I recommend taking the examination.
It is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the for and against in connection with the PSA examination.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the best way to reduce the risk of disease seems to be to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Society for Research on Cancer.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
A certain percentage remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, fighting smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for Quebec.
An encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight
Physical fitness and obesity are, according to SCC, another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report adds.
Nutrition
It also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid those for which the same applies.
Conserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although according to one of them there will be a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been proven.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
“Being examined doesn’t mean you have cancer.”
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a justified uproar last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model – our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, physicists are still not 100% sure that this is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle available, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
New data released this week during the major physics congress in Kyoto rather confirms this, but we still lack all the data to be absolutely sure.
However, let’s assume that this is the Higgs boson, as the risk of error seems small, and let’s look at what it is.
In this world, there is a completely undeniable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be bypassed – and don’t try to do it too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a similar law: Pauli’s exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state” – this “state” roughly creates some of their properties.
He also divides particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow the Pauli principle.
And at the other end are the bosons, the anarchists who do not value anything at all – not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons, which we will leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles", by which great natural forces are spread and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow associated.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it’s because of a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or a “light particle”, which is the “bearer” of an electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this “interference” an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing but a photon – and therefore one of the bosons, the “bearers of force.”
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that it is necessary to "disturb" another field, the Higgs field, in order for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; very high energy values must be achieved to excite it, similar to the freezing level of a pond, where only a very large balloon is shrinking.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of the part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory – a large hadron accelerator with a circle of 27 km! – in order to produce such energy.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again useful for us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or materials react with electromagnetic fields.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on its own on the refrigerator.
And it’s also true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (like a photon, let’s look at it) don’t have it.
And Ms. Nováková asks why all these researches are what “we’ll bring”?
From a scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to investigate any discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of SM.
Not a few physicists literally wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open up space for “new physics” and close up some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to state that the model has so far huge shortcomings, it does not bring any explanation of gravity (angle!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic matter (angle!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Reactions
The responses of these researches in the everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. Novakov can only be predicted very hard, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no one.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would bring about.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle – who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who created the first constant laser beam (the previous beams were pulsating) in 1962, I have already said – the laser was initially considered such a “labor toy”.
Just imagine it...
In addition, the application can also result from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not initially plan it at all, now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC must necessarily change our lives, but it means that one really never knows...
Palliative Care – The Best Way to Get Away from Life
Through its Commission for Dignely Dying, Quebec has recently engaged in the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate is expected to continue in the near future and the draft law is also being prepared.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this important area.
The Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
“They gave me five years of life and it’s already seven,” he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care House in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“It’s still a shock, you can’t prepare for this,” he adds.
The sickness has done its job: an enormous weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
Resignedly, he looks at a tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is bold and even smiles, speaks to strangers who stop at him, brings him medicines, offers a bath.
The courage to die.
“My greatest desire is to get rid of that diarrhea, it humiliates me,” he confesses.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"A lifetime one learns that men urinate standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the childhood stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of that person" whether he accepts that return, the psychologist says.
In the opinion of a number of people involved in palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is up to three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation at full consciousness".
But my illness allowed me to discover my children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any wishes in my life anymore,” she says, and then she agrees that we put a breathing apparatus on her.
However, he is still looking forward to his son’s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
The Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, provides nutritional care for the body.
This is how palliative care appears when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if we realize that we will all die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it’s a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can give him, for example, a bunch of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night they brought a beer to Mr. X, who later in the night died.
This morning, his son drank a beer in honor of his deceased father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, the days go one by one, but they don’t resemble each other.
Alongside a ninety-three-year-old man who rejoices at the last meeting with his family thoroughly underpinned on his pillows while drinking him in his honour, a tragic thirty-six-year-old man dies surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying out all options to survive.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the sick person reaches the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal Area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, a manifesto has been signed in circulation by leaders in palliative treatment such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure access to high-quality palliative care before it can be agreed to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days at the emergency in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They fear that patients will not ask for killing because they are not receiving proper care.
At the same time, a number of oncologists take care of their patients until the last moment, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she abandoned the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative pique team relieved their pain.
However, palliative care is not all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Grand Montréal area, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that sleep the patient until the moment of death, either shock or let sedatives be given permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
Patients who do not get rid of pain will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to grant me euthanasia” but rather “I want you to relieve me of my pain.”
The report was produced with a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, political party lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” in which the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unions and mafia are mixed.
This "industry" came Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has crumbled since we took fundamental measures,” says, ironically, Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police.
He sparked a scandal in 2011 following a thorough investigation aimed at the bribery of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which then-liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of government officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he says, “only the Department of Transportation has saved $1 billion on contracts,” when some people have kept their instincts on the lookout to get a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already resigned two mayors,” he adds, hoping to “disclose some people’s deception.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the “Marteau Company” police officers, who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal “money-manager cartel” significantly alleviated the inflating of contracts.
In recent weeks, a number of municipal councillors, including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality, have been investigated and charged with fraud and corruption.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribery in exchange for public procurement.
Transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have also received formal charges.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the “system” of public procurement.
During those years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was a candidate.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with funds whose prices exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him very detailedly before the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey matches and pocket fees worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for money chain contracts for which he exceeded the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector have admitted that they have been remunerated for overvaluing their bills by 30% to 40% through false multi-jobs.
The party’s mayor’s organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of blurring his eyes without embarrassment over a parallel budget that brought dirty money to his box office.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, thus plunging Montreal into a widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been fighting against the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for ... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a thriving real estate business.
70% of Election Campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says, “it is pulling behind the ropes in an attempt to understand how the system that is overrun by ants works to stop the gangrene and pick up the culprits.”
The process is “painful but positive.”
We are in the stage of cleaning the wound, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure oversight so that these questionable practices cannot return.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly .
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is especially concerned about the role of "members informed of this scam" if they do not immerse themselves in these cracks!
He estimates that 70% of financing of Quebec’s election campaigns comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, “I’ve heard it’s just a weak decoction of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to the parties to $100, but it does not solve the situation: "Until electoral spending is strictly restricted, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
He proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer fall; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can rebuild on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has defiled the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that everyone who mocks him take a look at his own courtyard.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season, PSG has taken a new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or by an entirely new dimension of PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day I get next to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
In matches it is easier.
In football everything goes so fast.
I am not losing my head.
From my beginnings at the preparation team at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I’ve always been moving on to each stage.
You are taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s reinforcements are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is important.
And that means that a player like me has more appetite for the game and wants to do the most.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Does Ancelotti have the right word at the right time?
of course .
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
He is now one of the best coaches in the world and one of the best coaches in the world.
He has enormous experience and has won many titles with top teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I had a lot of injuries.
The confidence he gives me is another reason for my performance.
What do you think of the first half of the PSG season?
In the first league, Lyon took the lead.
We remain in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we went to the eight-finals very easily.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
We want to be a strong competitor for European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first in front of the Port so we can play in retaliation for the eight-finals at home.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget is already...
In order for Paris to become a great European club, it must win titles and enter history.
It is not so today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to this intention.
Would it be a big failure not to win in the first league like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win the title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
They collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master.
But another club, Montpellier, had an even better season.
I think this year will succeed.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are striving for the title, I think we have the weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It’s not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept it.
It’s a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there’s still something we’re being accused of in the newspapers, it’s not as pleasant.
You ask yourself what more people can want from you.
You can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We try to create a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we showed that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn’t fought to the eight-finals for the second season, and they’ve also invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you can expect to be ahead of the other 15 points!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
The clubs Lyon and Marseille, which failed too much last season, moved into the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how great the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties we managed to win.
PSG seems to have relied on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is good that it is said that there is a “dependence on Zlatan”.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and that he gives a lot of goals.
That’s why he came here and proves he’s the star of the first league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
We respect the team and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This led others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How do you feel about the Euro 2012?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of my injury, I couldn’t play as I imagined.
But I experienced it and came out stronger.
I also play good matches today.
I have hoped for this since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first years at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good position in the qualification.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I do not want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the 1 : 1 draw on 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (conversible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows file exchange between partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
Around a thousand websites are already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it moves to the threshold of about $10 (an overview of rates is given on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world’s exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin is referred to as “the most successful virtual money”, “competing with the dollar and the euro” and “the period of current money”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like a “credit” used for progress in a video game that a person gains through a game or can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are current account book depositaries, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
This way, the network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public book of current accounts, which is distributed across the network.
The key phase is the recording of this new transaction in this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the phase of cutting a file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, and only then "cut off" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific footprint (nearly zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly connected to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would change the footprint.
If a user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes) for the purpose of fraud, the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different footprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundred million, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the assigned task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stored bitcoins stolen.
“The scale used is not related to the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
This also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, huge discounts were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged in converting bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the educational book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to authenticate transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the user manages his/her identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up with traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, Pierre Noizat says, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
“Bitcoin will take a while before it gets established, but 2013 could be crucial,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB in its report anticipates a re-evaluation of various risks, which are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what next?
French troops have left their areas of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghan people to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside suffered the greatest damage, and we punished them because we considered them terrorists.
And we too, since we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what all those wounded and crushed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but they are often villagers who reject the presence of foreign armies as they did in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek, and Tajik have joined them.
Now they experience tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains planted by mandlions thanks to French loans, went well.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by a helicopter.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress in 1994-1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time and the land was in blood and fire as a result of battles between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of control over the land was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, whom al-Qaeda completely controlled, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are working together to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main officials of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became shoppers, seized state land, sold it as land for construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited each other; most of them were never even in battle.
According to what I’ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won’t be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave like those who have taken advantage of American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are already tired of war and the ideology associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they learned about the modern world and its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
Schools are full, boys and girls attend.
These young people will have to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series showing the modern world, they watch everywhere.
The army is already there.
Will the authorities that stand in its leadership be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already re-establishing provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a degree of decentralization following the model of Western states, but the U.S. wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, the country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has succeeded in recovering, no fence is working, no essential irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiatives.
In a country devastated by three decades of wars, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors have spread that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the Western states were here only to seize it.
Without energy for processing iron ore or copper on site and without means for transporting raw materials across the mountains, no mineral mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine and have given international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist campus to preserve their role as the most prominent employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of their imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement presupposes the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys lyceums, departments of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative “Get Your Heart and Soul” has been working on the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, in which the Civil-Army Action Service (CIMIC) of the Ministry of Defence, which was abolished in 2012, has achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages thanks to the countless French NGO.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to suppress the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of cultivable areas.
What memories will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the rebellion led by foreign groups, these farmers, according to their words, wish to obtain a slight civil aid in their favor, which would be properly controlled and touched them directly.
Difficult Work on Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi is playing poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has used the provisional text, which has been repeatedly amended, undermining the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the fragmentation of the country.
From the opposition’s point of view, the president persists in his “autocratic delusion”, continues to “violate his word” and “trap the law”.
His supporters, however, assure that this is a means to tackle the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of clarifying the text to the Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while protests are stirring up across the country.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi appears to be convinced that Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: “Either you approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers,” which would otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this particular atmosphere yesterday, 85 deputies of the aforementioned constituent assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
The majority of liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the constitution, they knocked their doors with no opportunity to make their views public.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have taken their steps.
In order to reach the resolution capacity, 11 people from the ranks of substitutes were rushed up yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators also commented on the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... the hour for prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately the same as the version of the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the principles of Sharia law are the primary source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", allowing for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the rest of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the liberals argue, who see it as a speech problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular in matters of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen in the beginnings of theocracy.”
Liberals are even more concerned about the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the current one.
So far, no specific religious consequences have been shown.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civilian state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text were not ulamians, but university staff, many of whom graduated from French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to “fiqh” [Islamic Legal Science].
And in the future, the question may arise to what extent civil judges are competent to comment on this."
The text approved yesterday is heavily criticized in addition to the religious pages due to the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there have been significant restrictions against the former regime.
Another controversial place: powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military officials, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, proceedings against civilians will not be prohibited in military courts, as the human rights association has demanded.
These associations speak of their doubts in connection with the text which they consider to be against freedom.
The crime of blasphemy isined and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture laid down in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak in a television address last night, protests are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaited by holy places, the world’s navel and the sea of saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the untouchability of nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Praying for Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God’s mercy will descend on all who enter this “bathroom.”
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the net.
Here Jesus also appeared to His disciples and after His resurrection.
Most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
It is called the Via Dolorosa, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus.
It begins at the fort of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Grave of God on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew from which a cross was made for Jesus’ crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Lamentation, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes here, which are then fulfilled.
Path to the Vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountain climbing can get to it on their own.
They will be transported to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
This skiing paradise is transported by a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can’t visit them all on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts or rolls from the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Jewish desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Visit the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition, his canvases are widely represented by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which presents visitors to several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of bath users and spa caregivers from that time.
In Caesarei, it is worth a visit to the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenirs.
Entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Yad Vashem Museum in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built to commemorate 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and find yourself in total darkness.
The stars glow.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main resorts of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinaries and oceanaries.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can swim even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people swim in it all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet's mainland - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
Azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who do not know how to swim.
The surroundings are unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment using saltwater – saltwater, and medicinal mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your nerve problems.
Touch the mysterious past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city can be found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love to walk through narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press onto the walls in the street of “your” sign, luck will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may encounter newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors including Pilate Pontius.
The carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists in a word
If you’re going to Israel, you don’t have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian in this country.
On the trip it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mainly by bus, but a high-speed tram runs in Jerusalem, and Haifa is the only six-station metro line in the country that connects the lower city with the upper.
This is basically an underground railway.
Traveling by all kinds of public transportation costs 6 shekels, for which you can ride with a transit for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, work is stopped on marketplaces, in shops and in public transportation.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes containing combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of meals made of lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus, various types of sauces, balls of melted garlic - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are a lot of cats that are gracefully “going around according to their taste.”
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The leading cats love populated places and with taste they will go into every goodness.
Renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day, depending on the car brand.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And borrowing a bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To explore the country and to rest came the most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating a law on compulsory language tests, scammers have already appeared in the country selling “falsified” certificates.
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law came into force, which requires all working migrants to pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipality, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to people who succeeded in obtaining an attestation and obtaining an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times the question: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for visitors themselves?
So above all - respond representatives of the Migration Service - this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
Their rights should be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise among emigrants without occupation, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language – says Sebelev with conviction – the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will secure a “pass” to monstrous, narrow dormitories, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
“They are promised one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive, they are cheated, their passports are seized, they do not pay the promised wages,” said Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajik Labour Migration Administration.
Do not stumble!
Moreover, many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia acknowledge that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the given job.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
Their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they must prepare for work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
It is true that with regard to the Language Testing Act, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don’t have it, they won’t take exams or get any other official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers are living illegally in Russia as before.
“Welcome, not forbidden entry”
Many of the incoming workers argue that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic barriers and all those language difficulties.
Legalization in addition costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we have essentially fake documents, without registration, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists about his experience citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
“Don’t be lazy, buy a painting.”
On the first day of the language law, it was discovered that not only migrants’ registration documents are fake.
FMS employees have already seized several fake certificates of passing the language test.
The counterfeit documents are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the problem of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more than passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task in the near future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government agencies can promise foreign workers who failed to pass the tests for the first time the necessary time to take a course on the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low.
The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has proposed to tighten the law on owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of government agencies to recent events: the trigger was the cases of shootings at weddings, which went without casualties, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which weapons can be licensed - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that amendments to the weapons law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "stricken the screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of "unreasonable tightening" of the law.
The percentage of bullying with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist, said in an interview with the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012 142 crimes from the use of firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior were committed, while in the same period a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the laws on civilian weapons will not force the perpetrators to move to the "black" market.
According to them, at present any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs says the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" weapons market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshots of sites that accept orders of weapons
The first of them - "army or military route", that is, a weapon that was stolen during combat in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranec said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces officials.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "mainly" are sold from military warehouses.
There are often explosions in military warehouses.
"It's proven that some fires were intentionally set up - to cover up the flaw," says the former soldier.
Barance and weapons manufacturers also make their contribution.
"At present, private weapons companies are emerging that are not competitive in the international market and are discarding the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There’s their production, sometimes weapons are manufactured here in the retail industry, and a mafia has emerged that organized their smooth production,” explains the former soldier.
Where did the gun come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Analysis of Problems and Planning of Public Administration.
The researchers examined reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and data from public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and executive agencies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "by the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their manufacture, 5% are "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked us not to name him, is convinced that the weapons found in excavations by black "archaeologists" have long been not purchased - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the batalion officer, the interested party purchases a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it for 900 euros for a piece with two tanks," he says.
“The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever they start to burn a plan to clarify crimes, they will make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers,” adds the adviser.
Like in a luxury store.
The seller and the buyer often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy appeared who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Test" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the "point" where we would deal together.
I found out the price there.
Military Rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the seller-advisor.- I have such a friend, but I do not trust him completely.
The sellers in the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to arrange that my daughter had a tooth."
And now I’ll get there through a man I’m sure of.
He will only give them to me, because he knows that I will not give him away.
Beginners search for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he worked out a publication on the subject.
The scheme has not changed, he said.
They gave him a photo album with “everything you’ve thought of.”
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the soldier remembers.
The buyer, according to the words of Aries, does not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential customer, just don’t buy – we go with the seller into the woods and set a target for it.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the gun is shooting well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Rescue on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups on "Vkontaktu", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are needed.
"It is enough to have a specified amount of money," they write in the ad heading on the website "Buy a combat gun or a machine machine".
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
Selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently decided on a huge network of scratched websites, and people wishing to buy a military weapon can scratch with a scratch.
People rush like hungry fish to catch a catch and then catch coal in Siberia.
Military Speaker and Higher Military Officer Viktor Baraněc
I have heard about such schemes:websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Weapon.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay without weapons and find yourself behind grids.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the non-governmental organization "Right to Arms", you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
Weapons are shipped from warehouses for long-term storage through medium-range warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and blackmail of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the United States
A quarter of all teenagers in the U.S. will work at McDonald’s.
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen in America against low wages in Walmart’s hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as “McDonald”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
So far no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
This action is supported by trade unions and a number of leftist social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that regular workers in Walmart and fast food systems receive, the organizers of the protests aim to creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade union movement.
40 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when an orgia of cheap sales hit America, captured millions of people and in some cases was accompanied by fighting.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and leftist activists of multinational business chain companies whose goods are aimed at people from the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at work.
The availability and range of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or manual scanners.
Demonstrators on Black Friday demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the amount of spending, employees say.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase entirely on consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest was held only in nine countries and the company should not cause practically any damage.
The "Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday evening until midnight the following day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Overall, its cash registers carried out almost 100 million transactions on the "Black Friday".
A spokesman for the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the leftist Huffington Post website that “less than five” Walmart employees left their jobs, and that the protest was “another media sensation” organized by unions.
“The unoccupied box!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where their targets were not Walmart shops (those in the aforementioned progressive city are not very popular and therefore barely there), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn’t even pay you sick leave and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing their wages gradually, but only slightly, and their New York staff are getting an average of $8.90 an hour.
No one has a lower wage in this city.
I don’t understand how you can live in New York for that much money.
McDonald’s employs a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their primary source of subsistence or plan to stay there for a long time.
Currently, I constantly encounter in interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on that money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and chefs in fast food begin to receive at least $15 an hour, more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the field of fast food.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration from preventing the founding of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in fast food is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Disagree
On this day, noisy protests took place in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was a midday gathering at “McDonald’s” near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, notably city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even pay you sick leave and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!”
Demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor's candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand together to support fast food workers so that they get the fair remuneration for their work and the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food sphere.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, although far from all of them were fast food employees, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is not yet clear.
The brain lies on average.
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google unveiled the working model of this news, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for the relevant patent.
In an interview with Sharam Izadi, the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge Laboratory, the company’s scientists said that glasses are the past.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Can you tell us what your research team is doing?
- We are dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, most often touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting option of driving using gestures.
What awaits us in the future?
Despite Kinect’s transfer of interaction to the physical level, many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a greater amount of data), but the output stream has not yet improved.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on a variety of technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to allow the computer world into our physical world, to make it more realistic.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice control?
This is a popular thing, but is it not exaggerated?
- Certainly it cannot be considered a panacea - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about smelly ones, just about such scumpy, short ones.
The gesture would not be captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
It’s still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
And how?
How do you ask me, for example, to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and show it at the same time.
I usually just talk.
It will be very difficult to recognize.
So you want to get the user to adjust to what the machine can or can’t do at a given moment?
This is not necessary, but it is a connection.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - this is what we can reflect in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it’s not just about megapixels themselves, but as matrix and depth.
At the present point of view, all the current technologies are inadequate for us - it allocates work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of shots per second is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and current data streams of 30 frames per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands to what extent it affects the interaction of man with machine.
For me in the work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don’t need so many touches, but I need some shots per second extra.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Three "cams" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually the usual sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to measure the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or worsen it, because it would increase the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect system, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras, and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional location.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in your raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest variant would be the "portable" version of the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch anytime from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection display and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time, a weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
His hands feel nothing.
What are your responses to this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the supplementation of tactile perceptions could be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of second hand as a kind of substrate for displaying.
It captures the pressure very well!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tangibility to these “images in the air” – for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays at a defined point where the finger is located provokes a touch sensation, but it’s still very weak – like you’re blowing onto your fingers’ belly.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you ever tried to cheat your brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
That’s a good idea, I haven’t tried it yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for a long time—how to make a person physically in a very narrow space believe he is walking through an open, virtually infinite space—we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms, and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes the goal, then work is still for many years.
That’s what makes virtual reality work so attractive to researchers—a lot of things are in the beginning.
Taste language instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the limits of the city, often find recognition in Europe, without reaching all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in the fashion pubs and at the vernisages.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the faces of citizens, raising everyone’s mood.
Recently, he took the bottleneck in his hand and became a St. Petersburg bottleneck, as he matured into this complex role with his whole Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
“Cyril, why are you walking around the city in red, and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imager and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is only a little different from grey, arouses aggression and arouses bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making an interview.
The whole history of my provocative acts is above all an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you needed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my path was.
Then the wave of old free, unofficial artists passed and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonevs who brought us to the "Pushkin 10", and there were no more waves.
It attracts me to theatre, to clothing, to music, to all genres except for words.
- And it all merged in your art clinic ...- It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995, I took a place at Puškinskaya 10, and there, before the reconstruction, there was a music-art club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemians.
There many were born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don’t forget how the Strings brought up with the project “Ear of Van Gogh”.
The string and his friends sang under the scissors of light songs, dressed in adjacent t-shirts, in the middle between them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Halli-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus began his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular guests are here.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press, a special award was "People in Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, thus ended my peak.
In modern times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits, in which it is vividly captured up-to-date and penetration.
I will have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be sociable, but today it is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns everything is wiped out, tragedy is filmed.
I love grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet by clothes, focusing on the external mechanics, not the inner man.
Or maybe you can’t give him a hand and you need to spit him in the face.
And the deceit will be removed by dressing.
- We recently saw you in the role of a city bottler.- A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who should be it if not me?
Can art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, applied art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people gathered in bushes, the goddess loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-society, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I’m not a bankroll to please everybody.
Think about who you like today.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
There will be thousands of spectators at Mikhailov’s Stase.
- There are fans coming to him, there is a sexually social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land and 10 thousand will not come, and the result is less management, less money, everything is broken.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will fool them and break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted such pictures, which at one collector hanged on the wall together with Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people are often confused.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing paintings.
I am for such a culture.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an agent through culture.
However, not everyone is concerned with culture.
At the time of the ordinary Tsars, this was not the case at all, the Tsars might not understand the culture very much, but they understood that there was a need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We in St. Petersburg have people who might be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner because there is a need for great experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and guide them on the right path.
Today we are thriving.
The same Erarta, but they differ in saying frankly that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
What do you think of St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right ground.
In our country, art is very poor.
We need a cultural ground, but today there are more writers than readers, which is wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who love to go to exhibitions, concerts.
At this level, we are only weak.
We need to make art a fashion affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by St. Petersburg Grants.
Born in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of space ships with the Earth’s on board embark on a journey in search of a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep their race in conditions of weightlessness or on a given replacement planet?
I think the choice is not very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered, even if only hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P.K. Šternberg State Astronomical Institute.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, the temperature on Venus reaches 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the problems of reproduction in space began scientists with the flora.
Experiments on plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peach grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was brought into orbit - the very small fruit flies of Drosophila.
In 1979, a prepel egg was sent into space to check how an embryo develops in the state of weightlessness.
We get an absolutely normal bird at the exit.
But then problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find support, must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don’t find support, the birds fall chaotically and make cuddles.
After 10 hours, the instincts of the newly exhaled birds completely disappeared.
The birds did not react to light or sound.
And the problem was that within four days they simply died.
"Two times we let the birds crawl, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," commented on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Syčev.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but will only be beings of one sex.
An experiment was conducted with rats who were being sent to space already pregnant.
There was nothing supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on Earth, the cosmic rats were born.
However, getting closer to the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been achieved.
It is a difficult task.
Animals, when losing their usual environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, humans can.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Thereskovs.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman’s body.
Our Tea Tree has flown away and no one on Earth could say if it would last a flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Nobody has answered this question yet," said Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the missile-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son was born to the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savická, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who, after many years, have healthy offspring.
“Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights,” said cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero appeal, cosmonauts acquire the habits needed to work in the open space.
Water imitates the state of gravity.
Although water is a comfortable, but strange environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
Little Ichtianders seem to confirm that life on Earth originated from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother’s fetal water and that it is then easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first redemption, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to make a child forget something," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short – if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women the inevitable gravity, the force of attraction, is more natural.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis and the ability of the body to expel the fetus decrease very quickly.
This can be left aside if the stimulators of the activity of the muscles during childbirth will work.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's body discharges the fetus.
“And what next?” asks Valery Polyakov complex questions.
Children also need artificial gravity.
If the body is not attracted by earth, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn on orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special costume with a load in which he could train.
It will simply be deprived of what it unconditionally needs for its development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, the head of the IBMP bioethics commission RAN.
So the birth of children in space is now only a theoretical question.
Someday, however, it will come to be a reality, and when the Earth will travel in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
NKVD chief: control of the shvarcsystem failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and high-quality legislation in relation to public procurement, but it is failing to apply it.
This was stated by the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct – that’s what we lack in my opinion,” says Kala.
Similar conclusions are also shown by the joint checks of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nečas's approach to the so-called "shvarcsystem" is cited.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said that ODS won’t bother the entrepreneur with its checks – is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be somehow set, and if something is prohibited, then even the prime minister can not prevent the office, which has the duty to go to control and enforce duties," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Representatives, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What was it specifically?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is the European legislation that regulates the way in which public procurement can be dealt with, followed by the individual national legislation and then also the practice itself.
We put all this together, and even though the control is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is "stricter and more perfect" in Germany, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What does this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is such a joint control that could help us stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means obtaining an appropriate thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal acts.
But by reducing the contract limit, we don’t necessarily have to that.
Per the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will be able to make it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it similar to the NRC, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, but it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices proceed similarly.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, it also has these accounting courts at the level of the individual federal counties - in this the system differs a little from our own.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds managed by the counties and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Court of Auditors.
Is this legislation easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better in everything.
Do they need better controllers?
Certainly not, but I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider a model are facing a whole host of problems.
Otherwise, it would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, right?
As for the domestic legislation, what has the new public procurement law meant for your office, are its implications already manifested?
Given that the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet shown in control actions.
Because we are doing ex post checks, we need to count on some delay.
We observe this for the time being only in the process of preparing future checks - we launched our new tool "detection of risks of inefficiency", through which we passed almost 14 thousand public procurements, and we analyzed them - there those changes will of course be manifested, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of procurement will be adjusted and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem here may be that the rules will be “stricter” and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous rules, the controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, by the regional council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal errors that do not affect decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how to get out of it?
Let us see where the road does not lead.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with the controls of the so-called "swarcsystem" - and what does this mean?
Is Swartz Prohibited or Allowed?
The law must be somehow set, and if something is prohibited, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the office from operating, which has the duty to go to control and enforce duties.
He may say, “We’ll change that law and allow it,” but he can’t say that we’ll do as if nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are fairly strict rules on how what should be formally done – which is right to protect competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct – that is what we lack in my opinion.
The roads are freezing, but mostly seamless.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, most of the roads are rough, with extra caution.
Karlovy Kraj
This morning, the roads were frozen and frozen in some places.
The temperature has fallen between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm up slightly during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
There is about 30 centimeters of snow in the mountains.
In some places, visibility was also lower due to fog, according to the data of the district road dispatch.
The R6 highway and first-class roads are now accessible without restrictions in the region.
However, caution should be taken, for example, on some walls, where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
In some areas there are still remains of ice and snow.
Especially in higher positions, more attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubic and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic there is a danger of frostbite, in higher positions and in the mountains, a layer of snow may be taken on the roads, the Directorate of roads and motorways reports on its website.
Road drivers warn drivers of frost, it can form especially in higher positions of the Pardubic region.
It can be in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is mostly on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orlické hory.
The snow cover is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today it is most often clear to half clear without rainfall.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a weak wind.
Plzeňský kraj
The roads are open this morning, but with increased caution and driving needs to be adapted to the weather.
It is cold in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Drivers are also expected to be in a place with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the district traffic department.
Highway D5 is accessible almost without restrictions, but increased caution is recommended by traffic managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, in the southern part of Plzeň and Tachovsk can be frozen sections.
Communications of the second and third classes are wet and also in this case the warning for frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be cautious especially on the less frequented roads in the area of Šumava.
Olomoucký kraj
With snow on the road today must count drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical spray, she remained on the Red Mountain Saddle and on the way to the Videlsky Cross.
Road drivers were driven into the terrain by snow at night, in Schumpersko according to road managers snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the country, roads are mostly accessible without restrictions.
“At the highest levels of the mountains, there are snow remains.
With the snow on the Červenohorské sedlo drivers have to count in the direction of Jeseník," said today ČTK dispatcher of the shumpers road administration.
In the night, their colleagues in Jesenicko also went into the terrain, the roads up to the highest position are now naked and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are accessible without restrictions, but in Šternberg drivers should be careful in forest sections where the roads remain wet.
Liberecký kraj, Liberecký kraj
Several hard-to-reach places are this morning by road drivers in the north of the Czech Republic.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, a mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech central area, on the contrary, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been.
Traffic freezers are concerned, especially in the surrounding area.
According to meteorologists, it was in ideal conditions at night - during the day rain and melting snow, clear and frost at night.
Unfavorable conditions have also been on the road I/13 on the border between Ústeckého and Libereckého kraje.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bending branches of trees, which were bended to the road under the snow.
Shimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the other alarming news that we people love to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also host a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce them closer to the readers?
This is a national campaign that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, from 21:00, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first it was probably my idea, then we invented it all together with our designer Honza Augustou.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by purchasing on www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world cancelled".
It’s already very popular on YouTube today, will it also sound at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and in the complete conclusion, that is, if we all succeed and the end of the world does not occur...
All three performers perform at the same time.
The hymns will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We also collaborate with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts.
We are actively engaged in these projects.
Most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the revenue from the concert go to?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkovo Institute.
Students of the Jedličkova Institute are regularly attended by lecturers and engaged in activities that enjoy and interest them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go for lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them to do so in this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedličkova Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
A number of musicians and performers will perform at each concert.
According to what did you choose them?
We’ve been trying to build a program that will reach all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bártou, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar “bombing” in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time in Prague Spring, so here we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, would like to link it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your overseas plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage this logistically and organizationally?
It is not as terrible as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on an electric wheelchair, its wheels must travel in the luggage compartment, and, of course, we carry a large amount of cargo and bins with tools.
However, so far it has always been done without problems, both CSA and British Airways have been greatly prepared for us that I have been surprised many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in barrierlessness, access to people with disabilities and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in Russia, we have witnessed that in the East everything is still in its very beginning.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move in the city center.
There is no such thing as preference for a wheelchair in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil society associations that are trying to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
So what do we have to do with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In both London and Madrid, it is common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
But it is not very usual for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life there, in that we are, on the contrary, with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or barrierlessness is one thing, but only when we become prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to really change.
Until now, these are rare cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular today, but let’s go back a few years back, what made you start it in 1998?
I went to the Jedličk Institute as an educator, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among other things, saxophone, so I and a colleague founded an interest-based musical ring.
Well, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it’s a bit out of hand (laughs).
Has it been popular in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working on promoting the band.
We realized that work that is not seen, in essence, as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it up with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is overwhelmed with things where one imitates the other.
This is logical in a way, everything new is taken carefully and takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret.
But that regret is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not any suffering by all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that when something happens to people with disabilities, it’s not just a shift for them, but for society as a whole.
Did this success also help you to be a strict boss, as many people have described you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the exam twice a week, attend the preparation and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
This is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one Angelica.
We are an open group, people come and go, this cannot be prevented.
Whoever has the desire and desire, the door is always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21:00
It will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brna Fleda and Ostrava Plynojemu with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be linked by a telemost to sing the song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled".
The aim of the concert is to raise funds to equip the multifunctional, barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedličkov Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years have free entrance tickets in the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on November 12, 2008).
Poland started a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of ESA projects over the years to come.
However, the trip to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights before World War II; but they did not always encounter understanding.
I would like to recall, for example, A. Šternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented the ideas of his pioneering work The Entry into Cosmonautics.
The thoughts of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold and after years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his entry into space in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 – 1966) became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 a railway was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the missile was to be used to start the drone or to brake it.
Information about this is only known from the press.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to use missiles.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckieg.
From the conserved materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter missile, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza of the author Leliwy-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated all the projects for the military use of missile technology.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities ended with the beginning of the war.
Other works devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November edition of the 1954 issue of Problems magazine, which contains four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will be engaged in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has sought to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first Chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-Chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to conduct scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a reach of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 missile were launched in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development type was already supposed to be capable of actual scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the height of the wind.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missile was Meteor-1 developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum reach for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aeronautical Institute was developing the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a weight of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
In 1960, Poland joined the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) and two years later, the National Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) was created.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Public Works.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in the public.
It will be interesting to look at this issue from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic formations, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unshakable financial speculation.
The influence of significant differences in the price of labour (wages) leads to price tensions.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the state where a manufacturer tries to compete with the import of cheap goods by "undermining" the competitor's price in order to seize a greater market share and thus increase its own profits.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs to either transfer production abroad, or buy cheaply there, or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
The whole situation is reinforced by the absolute reluctance of business owners to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in the hunt for profit.
The situation is so widespread that no specific statistics are needed.
The ruthless practices of private capital create in individual economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance to their own population regardless of social decline.
This is reflected in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to economically force the own population to accept the price dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the restriction of workers’ rights in the field of labour law.
The result is an increase in poverty along with an increase in the gaps between the rich and the poor.
In the Netherlands, there have been public spending of food for the poor who cannot live by their own work.
The number of these people reaches millions.
Within the framework of increasing competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive such wages that the state must pay them up to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures in virtually all of the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline of the social level are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for hungry wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital may one day come to the country.
The question here is, but where does it come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, or African still works for a fraction of the European salary.
This applies to Latin America.
Liberal theories and the mass media argue that the state cannot participate in capital in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital firmly insists that the state must not interfere with the economy by interfering with governance.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now it actually directs politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer, yes.
The evidence is that there is a practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In the SRN, the situation is such that state ministries, due to a lack of funds, commission drafting bills to private law firms, which are heavily connected with industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power thus does not come from the people as the constitutions of the Western type proclaim, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberally-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation as Appianus describes it in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disintegration and the authorities were occupied by violence.
For bribery, illegally obtaining favor, and with the help of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption flourished without any barriers, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."the characteristic people didn't go to office at all, so once, as a result of this ruin, he was to stay eight months without consuls" .."It really began to talk about the fact that the only remedy in a bad situation is self-government and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man..." Appiános thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed to permanent democracy to self-government.
As in antiquity, contemporary society is based on a ruthless preference for self-benefit regardless of the general interest of society.
Private capital is by its nature no longer capable of understanding and applying the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At present, the disappearance of these systems in favor of a liberal democracy can be seen as a break in anticipation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignore in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing now, along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both international and intra-European levels, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen state capital participation in the economy, strengthen citizens’ influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and can never come out of it" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refren is "Let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want war, there’t be any,” said Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there have been a lot of reactions.
Some stand for Israel, argue for its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically repeated waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, the people of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
It’s about offering readers a glimpse beyond the curtain, a glimpse of what has been served primarily by the tensions that have lasted for 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
Human history is first and foremost a history of power struggle.
In every epoch, we can find some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who completely autonomously directed their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands one that could be considered the head of the hoodie (if anyone still stands above them I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
of course .
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) in the 1990s to stop associating their name with the highly criminal acts behind which they have always meant consolidation of power, multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have a major stake in almost every central bank in the world and against countries where the central bank stakes are not being held or preparing for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschild Central Bank’s Bank of America, began issuing his own (understand government) money during the Civil War and was assassinated in the theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led between 1859 and 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree of consecration by Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of removing the large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial domination especially of Great Britain, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their convenience and luxury is enough and they do not consume so many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a precursor for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds works is to provoke a crisis and subsequently offer a solution (order ab chao).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to worsening the situation (see the establishment of the Fed so that crises like the one they caused in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
So after they managed to unleash the First World War by assassinating the Habsburg successor of the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria of Hungary.
To facilitate the onset of World War II, the bankers of politics created a latent conflict situation by imposing enormous war reparations on Germany, thus creating the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then it was enough for them only to stress the Germans with a strong enough, guilty and simple leader offering solutions, and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, when the fire of war was lit.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds prompted the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
When World War II broke out, whether Hitler had stripped himself from the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or everything he had planned to do was difficult to guess, anyway, the suffering of European Jews in the concentrations created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as war reparations were paid to Germany for World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the outbreak of World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish nation, like in the latter, will be the victim of the first line of fighting, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of riot and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s take just how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where iniquity produces iniquity in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power were at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to select their own candidates in the elections.
Israel’s current prime minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, politician who does everything to unleash a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to grow into a global conflict, and due to Iran’s control of the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world’s oil passes (the corridor is only 2 miles wide), would also destroy the world economy.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “All we need is a global crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
“And he compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a seal on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that he may not buy or sell anyone who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of its name.
This is to be understood: whoever has understanding let him count the numbers of the beast.
The number represents a man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: When the Worst Is, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, which was the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out – it could not afford to throw the shaha overboard, because it would fundamentally jeopardize the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to Jimmy Carter’s loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film, directed by Ben Affleck, Argo, describes an episode of the story that brought America small victories.
Six employees fled the embassy just before it was occupied.
After a difficult peripeties, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film staff, which in the country watched the locations for the shooting of a sci-fi big film.
Combination of Genres
The plan, designed by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been hidden, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a peculiar combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a slump - an example can be the series of Danny's partners.
In the film, the moods change - on the one hand, documentary sequence from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic photographs of events and the way the same situations were shown in the film are shown - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the lightweight passages from Hollywood, dealt with with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions – men in costumes discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, in the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a reboot of his career.
From a ridiculous actor he became a respected director and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic notes.
Argo is his third full-length film, after the dark crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
This is Affleck’s first film not to be played in the director’s home in Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director’s older films elevated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows him in Argu, where Tehran “playes” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the introductory sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when somewhere history moves clearly.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in fictional scenes (fake staff at Tehran’s Bazar).
Too many things in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the told story does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
She almost works with it successfully, sometimes thinking something about reality - everything is no longer so elegant (the scene in which the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport turns off a phone call in America and the pursuit of the ranway is quite drawn to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the disappointment arising from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film loses a bit of a dramatic move, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
But it strikes hard.
As a reminder of one so far in a certain way alive history and proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, but enough.
Rules for Blowing Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually proclaims the survey on the most absurd banking fee, has now decided to proclaim a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
“We were led to this by the latest event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the poll.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the rates of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have been preferred in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory mixing of biocomponents into fuels, which are harmful to nature, a ban on reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of a dangerous substance, or the chicken cage size directive, which has made eggs more expensive this year.
Criticism has previously also faced the actual ban on the use of the term butter or the removal of traditional bulbs from the sale.
Bananas are 14 centimeters tall.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now even threatens to veto the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby also supported the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm in length in the Union and could not show "anomal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by merely harmonising the previously unified national standards that complicated trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruits and vegetables despite the opposition of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for winning in the poll may also be last year’s EU regulation, according to which the inflatable balloons sold must be warned that children under 8 years of age must not inflat them without the supervision of adults.
According to a U.S. study, balloons among toys are the leading cause of children’s deaths from suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children up to 14 years of age when blowing into hikers.
Strange ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd – anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must speak about the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia instead.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated in the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, for example, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks on the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies that could be in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on request for subsidies.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are handicapped because we don’t have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had to fill the warehouses that it had to export.
In order for the Czech Republic to go further to the ports, the EU had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission has launched a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development managed by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to go to the drafting of the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily criticized in Member States, the EU’s efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but have been forced by Member States in budget negotiations.
Emotions among Czechs are also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specifically designate its traditional products, while not always succeeding in this match.
After six years of struggle with the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs adopted the name olomouc, but our manufacturers had to rename the local rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century.
The name rum can only be used for products made from shrimp distillate, not sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, in the world famous cheeses feta and gorgonzola, marcipane from Lübeck, Germany, or Parm shunks have already been found, for example, Karlovar sushi, pohořelický and treboňský kapr and harvest hmel.
The EU trade mark can also be boasted by pardubic pear and mountain tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, Okamura says
How do you think a candidate wants to run for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I would not be running anywhere.
But I can’t watch the country steal over the last twenty years, the thieves run here, the taxes and the retirement age increase.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for Senator or President.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I have always said that I will go into the fight for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal, however, is not function, function is a tool for me to realize my vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest mandate.
But the trouble is not only that as a nation, we’re running out in the pub and on TV, but that we’re kicking down everyone who wants to try to change.
In addition to this, the media dishonest people and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
I was claimed to be paying a journalist or to be an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let us go to your visions.
In the struggle for the Castle you went with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and back-to-back declarations of over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
As a president, you have no such power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for guidance to be a free business, it succeeded.
The problem is politicization – when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, he deliberately rejects it, and it holds citizens back.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or a left-wing person?
In my view, I feel like people are on the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for us to move forward.
I don’t want to be left-handed or right-handed, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get damned when someone says you’re a populist.
Don’t you prove it with what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
You are trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about already work in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have passwords.
You will not be able to do this in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will manage to enforce, for example, criminal and material liability?
I have no other option.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push for it.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a television live broadcast where I would ask the heads of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They may have to explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality that will name the fools, it can be pushed onto the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
To be honest, I am not an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my views and vision, I try to find allies.
I am just starting out in politics and will try to get the majority support for my program.
I try to move things forward myself, and if it doesn’t work out, I’ll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything in one person, so I’ve circumnavigated a number of well-known people, whether they’d also run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchurou, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who covered up fraud with light heating oils.
I’ve been running with the fact that people are really dissatisfied, but now I’m in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections and those who went mostly elected the establishment.
There are two independent members in the Senate.
The people have elected the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or heads.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have the time to check out the past of every potential party, and I don’t have the money to do it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign, I only have 20,000 in my transparent account.
Do you have money?
You are talking about property statements, what is yours?
Private assets are estimated at $60 million.
In Prague, I have a land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artworks for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a couple of millions on my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boy’s dream – I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was galantine to women and at the same time fought against bad things and bad things.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of $60 million and don’t have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to put your own money into it.
This is not very convincing.
I don’t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I owe it?
I have invested 2.5 million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors indicates that I’m probably not so interested in my program.
I am not obliged to pay for my campaign.
The cost of my campaign will basically be covered by the amount of my senator’s salary.
But I’t survive from it, for example, I couldn’t pay my son for an English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I’t go anywhere.
So you will continue to do business in order to live?
Didn’t you say you’re going to stop these activities?
It has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I partially shut down my activities.
For instance, my travel agent will become my agent in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
I also need to live from something.
How much are you as an entrepreneur used to taking per month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don’t only take place in the head – for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Book Mountain – 2 images
“The building seems fun, it looks futuristic. Finally, there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around along the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large enterprise, says: “Of course, the house is nice.”
I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPads and e-books.
No one is going to the library in the old style anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a settlement close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities that are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education in the whole Netherlands.
To solve this silly situation, a decision was made a few years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not at all dizzying.
And so the city councillors realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of madly daring column graphs and a maker of funny, often even cynical constructions, accepted the matter with the usual calm and appeared at a competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a scarf on his face.
And while the commission was still staring around and shouldering, the dumb Maas wrapped his gifts on himself according to the size and ended his activist-founded speech with the words "Dear city town!"
This is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was built for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second place as the "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project was also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small township, which has not yet been able to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy store, is thus richer with a bit of contemporary architecture.
Specifically, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: a reader’s eldorado under the cheese tap.
The elevator runs through the mountain massive, but the real spatial and reading passions are discovered only by walking through the topography.
From all sides, the glassed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cabinet and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
Everywhere books, books and books.
“Normally, shelves with books stand along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly obscure and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have built the classic spatial configuration upstairs, and we have expanded the space for readers from the inside out.
The interior of Mount of Books is handy: in the middle there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black book shelves, which are one wall cover, one window and another staircase.
The appearance, structure and smell are strange.
Over the unknown building material, even sworn architects and construction engineers are turning their heads.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, to Standard magazine.
And so, one day, we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a fresky farm.
For many years, millimeter runo from synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last one, two seasons, and then they are ripe to be thrown into large-scale waste.
For the library, the runo — for the first time in such a quantity — was sliced into plates of four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colours into a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sports shoe.
After 105 stairs you can get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500-meter journey, you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots of flowers.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
“You probably’t believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is an ecological showcase,” says Trouborst.
Heat and cool with earth heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass cover, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden bonds, which stand vertical to the glazed façade, serve as shadows and capture a large portion of sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be fully automated.
Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even calls the “long-awaited soul” of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to devote one book from their personal fund.
It was supposed to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently counts 70,000 copies.
The concept proved.
The police are completely filled.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident has a certain relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just a decoration.
Thus, MVRDV entered the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
This is the starting point for identity.
“The Germans need to play a bigger role.
Germany abstained from voting on the acceptance of Palestine.
According to U.S.-Europe relationship expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from voting.
Why ?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
At the end of the day, NATO came in.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The reason is that they are just changing their foreign policy, from the policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the United States, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are on two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they’re just getting stuck in their role, but they’re on the way to a “normal” foreign policy.
foreign policy in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It demonstrates a willingness to take positions that are independent of the positions of the United States or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests differ to a certain extent from the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its own interests.
Have economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large marketplaces in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to intimidate the public, nor the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
I don’t want to add too much to this, it’s not a one-sided relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German considerations.
Did it hurt Germany’s relations with the U.S. that Germany abstained from voting on both important decisions, for example the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German position.
Therefore, I don’t think it was such a dramatic breakthrough as in the Libya issue.
I think Germany will get some respect.
This signals that he must be regarded as an international player and that his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S. clearly vetoed.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration has probably secretly a considerable understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation there, this position cannot be held publicly, of course.
I think the differences in opinions are not as large as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
This is what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
Thus, they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead move things forward from their own positions.
This is what they are doing with the Euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and will push Europe toward a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leadership role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
If we look at the European crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a greater role, anti-German sentiment will emerge.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all kinds of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don’t like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular – c’est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
The name is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they are protected as long as they are not sued by the real owners of the brand.
Even then, it is not clear whether they will claim rights.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, which specializes in infringement of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Falsifiers need a few more letters to sign up for their trademarks.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, they will register Prada-Books.
In this way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens an organizer with the records of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trade brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also appears on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are several-storey shopping malls, in which almost exclusively counterfeits are sold.
Pattloch’s cases are different, but on behalf of his clients he proceeds against Chinese firms receiving from the trademark authority a completely official right to use a sign that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it “Bang Mingpai”, an affiliate brand.
This word focuses on “Bang Dakuan”.
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“It’s harming the trade, we have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sampling products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest-growing market with €15 billion per year.
However, deleting dubious mark register entries can be difficult to and something it costs.
The trial can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court rejected the lawsuits because the accused name became a “market reality” after a long period of duration.
When the plaintiff has a bad luck, he must still pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
The same applies to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently acquired German concrete mixed pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
In China, it is still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, which acquired Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
However, the CTMO recognizes that there were shortcomings there in 2010 due to too few staff and premises.
But last year, it wasly "the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed objection proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Doing something against it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China leads the list of new applications worldwide.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks – there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected on charges.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Starting a dispute against this costs several times, as the case of the German family-owned enterprise Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans had achieved that his illegal production of imitated car parts had been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have forgotten this because in Germany, surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich company’s complaint.
In two other instances, Freudenberg claimed the right, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You need to be very careful
The matter is now being debated in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs can’t be quantified.They even had to look into hundreds of years old files in the company’s archives to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg in vain offered the counterparty a “high six-digit sum in euros” to settle the dispute.
“You can see from that what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
There is a danger that Europe will be hit by the Far East.
This is in case the imitators will secure unprotected labels.
A Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to apply for the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business activity has long since been abandoned by the group, yet it has been able to deter the registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
He and his lawyer, Pattloch, have advised German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
Foreigners would rather have “everything that is worth protecting in any way to apply in China,” Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succeeds with the brand in the last action of its drama, then it will probably have to pay the counterparty license fees for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Dumbing, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir tries - and in Swaziland, the orphans of the parents who died of AIDS rejoice.
The story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there’s cheating: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, women’s boats, and men’s mokasins look for a tactic on the parquet and quickly find it.
One two three four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise, insisting, mumming, and pursuing each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa is almost lifted out of his textile shoes as he unites his voices with his wildly wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is testing a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers aged between 23 and 69, from a human genetic researcher to a homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text and even more in a very foreign language - zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Switzerland, there are 245,000 orphans from their parents who died of AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans from their parents who died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patronages in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a patronage.
It guarantees the child a school fee, school uniform and one warm meal per day at the Gogo-center.
In the Zulu language, Imbongi means “a storyteller” or “the one who praises.”
No one can speak Bantu in this space, only sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes also bringing them back to where they originated: to the south of Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, Esitjeni is located in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, depending on the power of the German choir.
40% are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay or sludge houses, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have survived HIV.
Esitjeni is seen in the smallest, the whole of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male prepuce, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry a weakened immunity virus within themselves.
This village was discovered by the congregation during a joint journey through Africa in the spring of 2005.Most importantly, however, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduate education, they have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the association "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Swallows and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syfilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
HIV is relatively uncommon among heterosexual adults, but approximately 20 percent of newly infected people fall into this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,677 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2700 cases.
That’s about one-tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from dirt and by close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternations of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, not least, honoraries earned by singing throughout Germany, some money will be raised.
"In total, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says the chairman of the association, Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village itself by Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who is able to push forward.
She also takes care that orphaned children find shelter, for example, with some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the Zulu language, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and took care to get the children to school every day in uniforms.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman paid by the association as well as two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
“Voices for Africa” also founded a sewing school, built two chickens and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get HIV tested.
Although the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it is quite strange in a country where the king officially retains 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his uncomfortable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is blamed, among other things, on the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free at every corner, “but nobody uses them.
Culture is different – unprotected contact.”
In order to promote cultural exchanges, the Imbongi choir travels together in South Africa every two or three years, singing songs full of grief, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award not only brings mood and joy, but also has already shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, the Ezulweni River Valley is more than famous.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is light,” people say there.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an airline of 8,733 kilometers from there, to the duping singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light shines here too.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is ice on Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published by the journal Science on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shade.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters thick and maybe even 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or asteroids that struck Mercury.
But let’s not put the find of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the chief scientist working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to clarify how water and other essential elements of life entered other areas of the solar system.
Sondes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by Earth, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth, a small window into the infinite distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This infrared image from the Spitzer telescope shows a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars.The oldest stars look like blue dots, worse identifiable are the pink-colored “newborns” in the birth hall of the stars.
This region of star formation — scientists unromantically call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The incandescent ring consists of the material that the star crushed during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
The image of the galaxy was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The Plejadic star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, is visible by the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, the colors are clearer.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is 700 light-years away from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to the Earth continent gave this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of unusual coloring.
This "baby" among the stars was captured in full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the biggest astronomical mysteries.
It may be the remains of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of Hubble’s largest and sharpest images: a spiral galaxy
Pictures of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar birthplace into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosa, astronomers have photographed the forecast of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are engulfed and inevitably colliding.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can call it the nickname Southern Wind.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows the excision of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cefea.
This 1,400 light-years-away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring from a black hole that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The column of stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, this star cloud, combined with the Rosette nebula, is giving birth to new young stars, which are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing – and the views they convey are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Its diameter is approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap way of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at an altitude angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equivalent to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching for extraterrestrial signals in space.
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who makes its computing power available.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile.
The Very Large Telescope stands here - and honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is 42 meters long and consists of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
Pictures can be taken early in 2018.
The two Kecko telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into space with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be created a new giant telescope - with a thirty-metre diameter of mirror.
You can admire it in the picture.
But the most significant impressions of the universe are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been providing photographs of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The image documents the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will first be launched into space in 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe there is ice on the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits the planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger spacecraft, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day to live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the Bible age.
There is also a museum of longevity.
Looking for footprints in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the Bible age.

Looking for footprints in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
Riding the mountains of Talyš can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus runs along the road with many turns along dense forested hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, almost as if we are in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives a Caucasian ethnic group of Talish, which is not very well known, besides speaking perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and living very old.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is filled with too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
For 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, as the road is only single-way.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May – and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year,” says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the life of almost eight dozen Talishs from the surrounding area, who are over a hundred years old, is documented.
My grandfather was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 he still gave birth to a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who wasly 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Muslim’s age seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man is said to have been married three times and had 23 children.
Didn’t Şirali Muslimov be wrong in his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about aged people in Central Asia.
“A striking number of elderly people also live in some areas of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “and there are also extremely many very elderly men in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be submitted, especially when matricles are lacking.
Each day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is that people in the area around Lerik live up to the biblical age quite often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many people living in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talish.
The director of the Fatulev museum, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of the Talish, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzajeva lives.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterfly, which unwaveringly oscillates.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaev's sons and a daughter.
There are also two small children around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, served in typical belly glasses "armada".
Mirzaev’s white teeth form the perfect line, and under the scarf she hides the long dark blonde copy, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk so they didn’t look like me and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is enough.
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I haven’t bought food in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she told me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything improved when the wheel was taken over by the "beloved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
It sounds strange from the old woman’s mouth.
But the cult of the Father of Nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He remained in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
The elderly in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from poverty.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros).
And the long-grained son of Mirzaeva is right: "Old people enjoy great importance in our culture."
They live in the midst of a large family, are loved, sealed and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The concept of human rights is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country’s profound fragmentation.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being debated sharply.
The Egyptian president has not spared pathos.
We need to make a transition.
“And for us to succeed, I am responsible before the people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but primarily to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular people.
All of them, so far hopelessly scattered in a confused opposition, are frightened.
Fear of the "God State" on the Nile handed over to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said he had temporarily reduced the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers to “save the revolution.”
What, however, the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, Egyptians and the world are not clear about.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the stable Constituent Assembly, with a predominance of Islamists, hastily approved in a fifteen-hour night marathon, are partly concerned.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal says that the jurisdiction is based on “principles of Islamic law.”
What does “principles” mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this is illuminated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult with the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
This may not necessarily mean, but it may mean that the clergy will oversee legislation, which would bring about a de facto deprivation of justice.
There are many interpretations of the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to beined.
These courts served under Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is formulated legally so inaccurately that by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In simple terms, this means nothing but censorship.
In any case, no article explicitly defines the equality of men and women.
Another paragraph prohibits the blasphemy or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
However, it remains unclear what is blasphemy and how it will be prosecuted.
Just as questionable is the formulation that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Is it enough in this case already a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts?
A matter of interpretation, like many more in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
“The revolution is back.”
For several weeks, the opposition against the Islamist push has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday evening to pledge to destroy the constitution before it comes into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranked third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs “to the trash of history.”
Through a short message service, Twitter accused Morsi’s supporters of trying to carry out a “coup against democracy.”
“If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition official Jásir Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a resistance demonstration, but out of caution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many covered women and Salafists who cried out, “The people are demanding the law of God.”
They called on Morsi, “Purify the earth,” and they assured, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a state similar to a civil war.
Morsi’s supporters obviously didn’t want to take this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people in the polls decide which direction the country should go.
There is a majority in favor of the proposal.
The word “human rights” does not exist at all.
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, has been stirred by Hafiz Abu Sa’du.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood while in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now the word 'human rights' is not used once," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi’s expansion of power to all three powers in the state forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous breach of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president actually abolished it,” Sa’da complains.
Without civil society, democracy cannot work.
Sa’da feels abandoned even by the international community, which is watching the struggle of the ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could get rid of him.
A demonstrator at Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
Norwegian Rakfisk: The Most Smelly Fish in the World?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be associated with the local appetite for extremely odorable fish?
Take a few cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a bunch of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
So you get the odor-paralyzing smell of rakfisku, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a wonderful view - and a ubiquitous smell hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted straw fermented in water for up to one year – it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and it starts to be cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, to say best, the most sublime food.
"You dream it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the course of the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat small pieces of fish and drink them with large amounts of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinks can remove the smell.
I will try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi, which was on a long trip by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airproof barrels with water and salt in the autumn.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were undoubtedly intoxicated with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, most of them emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival that was much richer than Norway until recently, are flowing to the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, though rather stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even if everything is expensive – a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) per piece.
Norway often doesn’t get into worldwide news – and it seems that most people like it.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still referred to here with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 event.”
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth lies behind the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents the prototype of Nordic well-being when serving plates with sleepless rakfisk.
We are, as they say, mindful people.
His English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don’t like to show up, we don’t like to show up.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial collapse was throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the ropes on their pockets tightly strapped.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“And eat rakfisk,” he adds with a careless laugh.
I’m standing in the snow in a row for something to eat – I’ve gotten enough of the rackfish.
Such a loose burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.
At night, the fish is here again.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding fish for the smell.
They have a connection with a live TV broadcast, in which the moderator with a butterfly is surrounded by a plate with a rakfisk.
It’s like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
“This is our point, Havarde.”
Applause and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, possibly with an aquavit.
Or maybe some of those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in its best times, steel barriers have been erected, closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent the arrivals from getting to work, but to prevent the protesters from entering parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico’s economy was good at the time of Felipe Calderon’s resignation, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to this goal.
Before shaking his hand with the U.S. President, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader differ even in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in good.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the rough and rough roads that were here before.
Boards with his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports resort and an impressive interactive climate-changing museum.
“We expect it to bring a real and lasting change,” says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of parliament for President Pena Nieto’s Party of the Institutional Revolution (PRI).
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in the field of security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was suppressed by Vicent Fox.
MEP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected within the party from Enriqua Pena Nieto.
And it rejects the opposition’s statements characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great politician and, above all, he is a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Located under the highways, it reminds in many ways of the suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
And the problems in municipal self-government are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called to help manage the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge landfill.
At the time when Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, which is far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
In the best case, Pena Nieto’s critics say that during his office he failed to adequately address the problem of women’s murders.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a wasted neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me a picture of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses the cry.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone was washing her body,” Buendia recalls.
There were signs of stroke on him and the post-mortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is a single word: "Justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was deprived of them.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old man, a troubled man and a knight.
They want you to simply accept what they say and remain silent.
“But it can’t be right when there are so many mistakes and omissions,” he says.
The sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has vowed to be his priority for the time he is in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning’s allegations regarding cruel treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning’s military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of the brutal treatment of Manning in prison.
He is accused of stealing thousands of documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the brutal treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor May Ashden Fein, during a cross-interrogation of a soldier Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention in Quantic, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-interrogation, which took place during the hearing on the request of the defence to reject the case brought against Manning on grounds of cruel treatment during detention, which is a sufficient sentence in itself, took place a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in detention.
An army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The report was later published on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday’s hearing, military prosecutor Fein passed together with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the detention facility in Quantic, where he was held under increased vigilance from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "outstanding" and rated the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms showed no complaints about ill-treatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns about various issues orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and suggested that they would address them, but did not notice them.
"They recorded "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 at a meeting with the committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime.
The military said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under suicide surveillance) to protect him and the safety of others.
“I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy an improved quality of life as I saw it here,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for two months before being transported to a detention facility at a naval infantry base in Quantic, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and once fainted there because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was going on in the world around him was very embarrassing.
“My world has only crumbled to the Arifzhan base, to that cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company after arriving in Quantica.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, shoes, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint on the treatment of soldier Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also questioned the accusations he raised in his Thursday testimony regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantic naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow prisoners at the morning count.
Manning said he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when counting.
During a Friday hearing conducted by Judge Manning, Manning said that on the orders of his guards he thought he had a blanket to lay off, but admitted that no one had ordered him to put it off.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or toothpaste to hurt himself, but he did not.
Manning said that night his underwear, toothbrushes and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his detention and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, it will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it planned to confess Manning’s guilt in lower crimes and that it would fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations concerning all detainees held in detention with maximum vigilance.
The charges against Manning include assisting the enemy, illegally making intelligence documents public on the Internet, transferring national security-related information, and stealing public property or records.
If he is charged in all cases, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities there are.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely got into the crowd and arrived in an immigrant agenda space where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”) and the other for “Extranjeros” (“Strangers”).
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in central California and I was called “Mexican” all my life.
It’s an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves “Irish” and my friends in New York call themselves “Italy.”
So later I ended up with the label “Mexican American.”
This was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my U.S. passport and stood in front for “Extranjeros.”
I was thinking about the moment when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
On the agenda, they had the usual issues to be discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of arms to transfer half the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after a U.S. official says something just a bit critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will go on the path of war.
And yet the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
Those are many.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it might seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even though we now live the American Dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American Dream, not the Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look at us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bond to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, merely about failure.
If our families in Mexico had failed, they would never have left it.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans do not like to bear it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in either.
They look at us like Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "temporary ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and push political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
No .
So that will not happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And due to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I think it’s up to you, friends.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for how they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel reluctant about how their family members were dealt with in the much closer past.
Hmmm .
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than I thought.
Old War, New Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed indicates that any such event is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into debris, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing everywhere around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the emerging chaos in the region.
Per this will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this can break their deadly deadly situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be not much reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire concluded on November 21 lasted, the fighting this week has strengthened the yards on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has been defeated.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the imprisonment of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most deplorable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its fierce rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas.
Hamas jubilant people say that the Islamic moon revolves around Israel, in the north from Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruled, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, in the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and major Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player that cannot be excluded either by Israel or America.
On the other hand, Israeli hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile system proved its price and many of Hamas’ missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever.Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the last round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza rockets have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, in part thanks to a wall that enters the West Bank, the main part of what may once be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why scorn these poor Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It will be better if we hold them behind that wall and punch them when they strike their heads.
Maybe hardline supporters will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not love Israel too much, their top priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments recover their economies.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying the rights of Palestinians to self-determination creates a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas – just like the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Repressions are already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographic situation is worsening as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks on Gaza, which take place every few years in order to suppress Hamas, will increasingly charge a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need encouragement from the outside.
The answer is what is proclaimed by reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: two states where Israel will assign territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that a ceasefire will give external pressures at least a little more influence on the implementation of the matter.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must strive to halt arms supplies to Gaza, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to embrace the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with an exchange of parts of the land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs on the outside also need to push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has his part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term in office, he neglected the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
This is sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia came into force laws on ugly cigarette packaging
The ugly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, display warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, and logo and brand colours were replaced by universal olive-green boxes with ugly images of sick parts of the body and images of children and newborns sick as a result of their parents’ smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes is the names of the brands, which are printed in the same small font.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regulation in the world.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by removing this bad habit of its attractiveness.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance they will never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," said Tanya Plibersek, the federal minister of health, citing studies that have shown that, for example, children associate the crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others argue that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging served to cover up disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding laws to the Australian Supreme Court, rose from zero sales.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 units to wholesalers and is expecting new inventories.
This is a good business for us.
As a possible obstacle, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic group the plan is targeting.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsorship of sports events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but can’t restrict foreign websites.
"If you're a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have that little space left to promote your products, the online space is the unbeatable place you want to be in for you," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted a rise in brand rankings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by “average Honza.”
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put on the job and created this video, or is a marketing company involved in it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how to deal with the new regulations rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new regulations – countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce compulsory warning photographs in 2001.
Now they have spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering tougher laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no influence on me.
I simply ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and pull the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in your mouth.
Honestly, there’s only one reason to quit smoking, and that’s my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack traffic store in downtown Sydney, says the unified boxes make it harder for him to balance them into the shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
“The government should simply ban them entirely, then we would say, ‘OK, it’s over, we’ll close the store,’” he said and decided with his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time thinking about boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite being distracted by books, magazines, and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our kids) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And given that most of us are constantly connected to some screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Yes is.
and no.
But I will return to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History, says (Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, boredom has a long history,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription relating to boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that with apathy there is no urge to do anything.
He says that the core of boredom is "a disturbance in the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slowly passing time."
Depression can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, boring people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when we only have trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which the person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the television program quietly more boredom than the other two groups – they had trouble concentrating but were not sure why and attributed these troubles to boredom.
When trying to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like looking for the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and spinning, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
“Research shows that children who are allowed to drill learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Professor Fenske said.
We’ve all experienced boredom at times—a delay in my flight, a whispering speaker, especially a long movie.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as: “Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.”
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimuli.
Teenagers are generally reluctant.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers getting bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were out of school.
Three percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knows that “adolescence is the peak time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: “Is boredom good for you?”
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Nuddy is the brain’s way of telling you you should do something different,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch television, it will make you happy only for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don’t really want to celebrate boredom.
But we should not be too critical about it.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant meltdown of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly over-stimulated,” he said, “it’s hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off.”
There is no manual on new marijuana law in Colorado
19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school student and footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and smoke she used to smoke her.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was travelling with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug use equipment – minor offenses, with a fine of $100 for each – and a date for trial was set for him.
“They treated us like criminals,” Mr. Orozco said.
Is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession offences have already been abolished here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older of holding a small amount that will be legally permitted once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have said they will continue with existing marijuana-related cases, still blaming people for possession.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver in the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This issue is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also struggling.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, in good or bad, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it’ll be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for Washington State’s alcohol licensing council.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent that we can follow,” he said.
The Washington Act, the so-called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not be a state licensing system yet, but legal possession yes.
And there are intricate mechanical issues that need to be solved over this time, such as how to balance the state’s directive on “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade in cannabis up to 330 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centres.
“Nowhere will be harder to place a licensed cannabis store than in urban areas, especially in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of the city of Aurora sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana on any citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would "immediately" stop accusing people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce the city’s laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter look.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face additional charges.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute crimes that were criminal at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the district’s largest city, no longer accuse adults of holding a small amount.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to deny all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state revealed a deep fragmentation among local officials in the face of this large state green experiment.
For district prosecutors, this is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for marijuana possession, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to bet on small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best track to become national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Lawyers and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also waiting anxiously for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Ministry of Justice will submit.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients who use it that have attracted attention, mostly the federal government has left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to knock out the door to seize a small bag of drugs, they are likely to oppose allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana stores permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to take action.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, although it will take about a year before any stores can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we give a license to somebody and then we're going to be a big federal affair," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
The council voted against this amendment.
We look at what the people voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
Not only today’s students are challenged for their opinions.
I don’t remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university I thought was the world’s largest residence of knowledge, a modern curled Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And yet, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of going to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and fell into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard that I gave up because I had objections to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from the bottled cups.
The truth was less comic.
I escaped .
Yes, I fled because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigotry and barbarism: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering why I’m pulling it out just now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right side of the center is suffering from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Younger Graduates (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and shown to be unwelcome."
They are calling for a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary program, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student political events, which the conservatives described as strangers and neo-Nazis.
The show was introduced to graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was riding a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as “sacrifice lambs” due to the introduction of higher education fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that “leftist influence in universities is growing.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club, without meeting us at all.”
Twenty-one-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is “unpleasant,” while nineteen-year-old OUCA elected president Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the approach of JCR members toward people right from the center.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the welfare of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a one-member minority.
I entered in September 1986, I was 18 years old and embarrassingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most fierce.
A year earlier, the university voted against awarding the honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be scared of the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when the new students get in touch with each other and with the professors, I was given a taste of the pellet that was supposed to come.
I found out that not only did the professors silently approve of the pupils’ ticking, but they also like to participate in it.
A policy of mining strike, privatization and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wooden auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translating French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Sir Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was quite stuck.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake, was very bile-like.
"Do the Thatcher refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students grumbled.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I suggest that you take some basic lessons of French in your spare time, if you’re not too busy with social matters,” Pitt concluded.
I went back to my room shaken.
During dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight tapping on my shoulder.
It was a second-year student named James who presented himself as a member of OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately it is so.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is a target.
It’s bad enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’s going to be worse for you.
Most conservatives pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, who (which irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How do conservatives love each other?” one asked.
They cheat on each other, right?
I felt what homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn into a Labourist and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me developed as a cleansing place of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost not there.
He hated this place for its provinciality and pettyness, and for his inclination toward a Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to drive from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, seeking refuge with my ruthless metropolitan friends and family.
I told my dad that I hate Oxford and why.
He could not believe.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They’t do that, not in a city of dream mood.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His blind eyes were grieved.
Try it again.
I am sure it is just a joke.
My heart would be broken if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his belief.
The following week, in the course of my teaching, when another professor of history declared in absolute seriousness that I was “the enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Even though I was shamefully red inside, I admitted that my “parents washed my brains” and called them “old fools.”
The relief was only short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was knocked by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week to Murdoch's newspapers.
My door was locked.
I crushed inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcases and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only came 14 conservative prime ministers, but which still hides behind the unmerited reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
Valentino prefers elegance than fame.
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host the exhibition of Valentina Garavani.
The designer confirmed this with the launch of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which presents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his respected clients could not be written.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is filled with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most prominent nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowden.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple carpenter from the city of Vogera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian cream".
Loving the royal family is not a bad thing.
“They don’t even tap a cigarette to a great carpet, as some wonderful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
“We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad,” explains Thyssen’s ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino has always preferred elegance than fame.
He’s still a star.”
Valeria Mazz presents Valentina
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazz is not forgotten.
“It’s been many years since we went to him for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were twenty and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every little thing of his apartment, in the decoration, in the food, in the music, in everything, his spirit was visible and felt.
All those invited were able to feel important and loved thanks to him,” recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Exhibition of birth
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been reconstructed into a distinctive seventy-foot-long passage offering role exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marchs through the passage to observe the “publishment” of dreams that Valentine’s masterpieces wear like the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume she wore Monica Vitti in “The Night,” or the wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
The mannequins include Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget him."
“I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
"I prefer him to others because of his femininity and great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," she added.
“I really like the colors he uses, they light up a lot and give the face a ‘scintil’.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she longed to be a major and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
It finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
“I bought my first Valentine dress for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a coat with calls, a carved livestream, and a top without scissors.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's wedding dress "very carefully...because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories they have in them."
The King of Fashion
The golden nail of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul the Greek in 1995.
It took four months to create these silk dresses of ivory colour with wrought pearls, twelve types of different cracks, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long pull, and 25 "bugs" (as the designer calls his swaddles).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the milestone of top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Valentino glossed over the years by the elite "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and honored by the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulate as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"My attention has always been attracted by his elegance, calmness, well-maintained and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
“I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, time left no trace of him.
When the princess says...
The world’s toughest craft: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, carriers in the area of an Indonesian volcano gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulfur down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, it must travel every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the inside of the Earth and, when in contact with the air, move into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along narrow stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which reaches 2,386 meters, it’s only 250 meters away, but it takes over 40 minutes for exhausted carriers to climb to the turtle pace as they maintain balance and carefully weigh their steps so they don’t slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
When they’re upstairs, they take their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and tiredly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company has placed slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of light bulbs, entertainment pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"Because we usually carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," Anto, who usually takes three trips a day, explains to us.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) a day.
Although this seems to be a negligible sum for such inhumane effort, it’s three times what he would earn on the field.
"The daily salary of miners here is very high. For example, 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day is paid for collecting coffee, and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a murderer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work wasn’t that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: “I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, breathing badly, still coughing and eyes irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to collect its tax on it, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, breathing badly, still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That’s the price you have to pay to your dream.
“I’ll be working for another two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he promises more than a solid English language.
This sympathetic and intelligent fate-stricken young man could be a tour guide, waitress or hotel receptionist, and instead do the job of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o’clock in the morning, as sulfur does not stop blowing out at night and its characteristic yellow color changes to blue and glowing darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto runs into the crater and illuminates his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers are carrying baskets with sulfur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders.
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanized sulphur mining for cost savings, nor does it provide carriers working on their own and with such effort, any equipment.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the photography surcharge, which, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) ticket, are collected by nature park guards from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for cattle, not people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will be able to work "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and splashes in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the dense vapors that come out of the volcano, the miners are so claimed that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent breathing difficulties, osteoarthritis, knee pain, and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, at 53 years old can load only 50 kilograms.
Every day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks then transport on a steep road between the hive to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik says, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty years old, also makes money mining sulfur.
Time goes by, but the constant misery of one of the world’s toughest crafts persists from generation to generation – the crafts carried out by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore seeks baby to save economy
Singaporeans are seduced by having no children, career, stress, and cost of living and education.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but nevertheless — or precisely because — the video spread massively to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses a local hint of the type "we put a bucket in the oven" as a mocking of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to spot the problem in a funny way with this advertisement.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency’s artistic director, said he wanted to use the influence of music to get people to fulfill their “civil duty.”
“It’s all about the internet, so it must have been fun and fun.
This is the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like spreading perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing possible, like composing a rap, to solve this problem.”
1.2 Children
The one who doesn’t take it too lightly is the government of Singapore.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures have had little effect.
Singapore is a rich urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in terms of population distribution is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and family department at the National Office of Population, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the delay of marriage and childbirth.
While there were efforts within immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has sparked resentment among the local population.
Some Singaporean websites show hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized forining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party of Singapore last year recorded its worst election result since independence.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare spending and immigration policy, some unexpected consequences have also occurred in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to influence the real estate trade.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boots boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their shoe boxes sell much faster than larger houses.
“They are more popular, so they sell days to weeks faster than larger houses.
That is why they are much better for our cash flow.”
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small homes in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could be aimed at increasing the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in a financial district in the city center suggests they won’t have much effect.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as is education, so many people are delaying it," says a young official.
“Let others have children.
But it’s important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress, and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is ultimately Singaporeans who have the last word when it comes to setting up a family.
What’s Private Offline Is Private Online
and privacy.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal nature or “a area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance.”
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he publishes on the Internet matters that he would not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico confessed to five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they viewed the concept of privacy as “something entirely personal” on a personal level and as “user name and password” when it came to social networks.
"My biggest secret I't disclose," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world,” she says.
“I’m putting nice photos on FB or pictures of how we play.
I also talk to acquaintances.
I’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all of his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I set up a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just give them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He’t care if someone recommended him to someone unknown.
The case of 14-year-old Josh is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits that he does not know 20 people from his friend list.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the police, none of them asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they insist on me or require me to do so, I’ll simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
These guys are not strangers to the experience of what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim did not withdraw from the account.
“You just activated the private regime.”
Then it explains a series of steps to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
“Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
“It’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to navigate on social networks correctly, they must understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform.
He states that: "The Internet originated as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital Natives are children and young people born in the era of technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to be taught, and we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature for it."
They also want to be prudent when what they want most is to be loved, have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences.”
The most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do something doesn’t work,” he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo as you posted to a friend?
Do you know what others say about you?
When you label people on photos from celebrations, did you ask those people for permission?
Do you always need to know what you are doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment just as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
“One is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside of the internet, and the same should be the case on social media,” he says.
surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational advisor explains that it is essential that parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand each of these tricks, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that setting up an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or disclose,” he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule “don’t talk to strangers”.
South America Summit Ends and the Lima Declaration Has Not Been Published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at the sixth UNASUR meeting of heads of state and government, but representatives from both the Foreign Ministry and the Presidential Office, who initially stipulated that the document would be published after the summit, said it would later be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
They also said the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information during the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "confidential session, audio transmission prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting, but not to the Peruvian spokesmen.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of presidents, which provoked the resentment of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets asking for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a “final statement” from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the initially promised Lima Declaration was not published, despite the press’s ardent demand.
On the official website of ASPA it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept the ruling of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru’s President, Ollanta Humala, and Chile’s President, Sebastián Piñera, met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will hear the defence speech of both sides to address the dispute launched by Lima against Santiago.
“We will work out and execute the verdict that will resolve the dispute that we are dealing with at this international court today,” President Humala and his Chilean counterpart said.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera said in a statement.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice decision was released after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered that decision to be completely wrong.
The summit took place without the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the resignation of then-President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was instructed to open the morning speeches and close the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and activities were planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements reached, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which agreements of residence are being extended."
“We are supporting actions to improve cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to jointly and effectively address the risks of natural disasters.”
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a winning essence, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of different parts of South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a read speech.
He noted that five of these projects concern Peru and its cross axis from the coast to Brazil, and two related to better connections with Ecuador, but did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring her back to the Union of South American Nations," from which she is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is integrated and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before he attended the regional meeting that he hoped to meet in Mexico on Saturday with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega to respectfully consider the International Court of Justice’s ruling on the maritime border dispute, which is being challenged by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor a deal with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
“I hope I will be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and reasonable manner possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega are scheduled to meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
During the summit, EU defence ministers met preliminarily to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe
Ecuador’s President, Rafael Correa, said today that creating a common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case really, has to learn from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one nation."
In this sense, he advocated the project of creating South American citizenship, which the member countries of Unasur support.
“It is necessary to the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already taking place among the Andes, but there are still backward areas that want to take us back into the past,” he said.
Ecuador’s president said he agreed to a reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states will be reduced and those who have signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
“Those at the head never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States,” he said in an allusion to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for asking him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, while “Sweden’s own legislation allows him to conduct an interrogation via a video conference call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he’s been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious,” she said.
“H, his physical and psychological condition may deteriorate because he is locked up in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
This is good for everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the settlement of the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks with London have taken place to settle the imprisonment of WikiLeaks founder.
“We don’t negotiate on human rights, we don’t use this word in this case, but conversations have been going on all the time.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
He said that “if Britain issues a release tomorrow, everything will end.”
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation allows, and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be put to an end.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, clarifying that he definitely does not tolerate “under-average, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the deceitful and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists at the service of profit, coercion and blackmail.”
From this perspective, he expressed his joy over the fact that neither such journalists, “neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor bourgeoisie control Ecuador,” and predicted that if he is re-elected, “he will continue the changes led in the right way and in the right direction.”
President Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay’s veto on membership in the Unasur Union at least until its next election, arguing that the whole “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism covered in legality” because in fact “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
The Ecuadorian president also said he considered “completely appropriate” the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed widely so that they can be overcome and there is a chance to move forward.”
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is being settled by the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instance if both countries commit to accept the verdict, however tough it may be."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
“I personally have never been interested in power, but such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
“If I won, it would be my last term in office and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it is the same.
I have already made a decision,” he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chavez has left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a recurrence in the president’s health,” he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador attended today the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 when his test results were confirmed: HIV positive.
“It was like a lightning hit me,” he tells, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to “soften a little,” but apparently without success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his hips and began to inform himself about it with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something unimaginable in the early 1990s when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options, and greater stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cutting wound."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused destruction of the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it means a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the patients who are diagnosed with the disease, while those who do not use drugs are better at it: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that one who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems up to 75 years with treatment," the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth reminding that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS – UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by May of this year, 187.
Why do people continue to die from illnesses?
"I think the problem is not in access to treatment.
This is what happens in our hospital.
The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of infection, i.e. in the late stage of the disease.”
He adds a convincing figure: “Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested.The only thing we need to do to more influence the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all people who apply for them.”
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a tumor disease that is one of the usual complications.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything else.
“If I’m going to die, I’d rather go out three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
I’ve been changing to the better, eating healthy, exercising, taking medication.”
His parents only know that he has cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate today in the framework of the World AIDS Day with his testimony those who are afraid.
“Let them get tested.If they risk, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, it’s better.And if they’ve been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they’re responsible.”
This message summarizes the motto of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajara journalist who finds information about HIV.
The biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "the delivery of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, today they give us packages of hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
“What do you want?” is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school advisors, pharmacy employees, and medical staff that teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this inefficient distribution.Let condoms be not just behind the counter, but those hundreds be in the dispensers on public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“This is not promiscuity.
It’s not even about “paying for beer and motels,” as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
It’s best to make condoms accessible to those who are already having sex,” he said.
Key figures in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This condition represents the fourth place in Mexico in new and identified cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood transmitted and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, as for one registered case there are four to five people who are unaware of the disease.
The ruling approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which does not recognize Grupo Vitro’s debt restructuring established by the bankruptcy in Mexico, creates a bad precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighboring country and solvency problems.
So it seems that the restructuring procedures of companies that are permitted by Mexican laws do not apply in the country of strips and stars despite international agreements.
The endorsement of the judge Harlin Hal’s judgment of June 15 last year at the North Texas Bankruptcy Court left Mexican firms in practice defenseless against the possibility of confiscation of their assets on the other bank of the el Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court for the major Mexican glass manufacturer, appealing against three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge in this case argues that the creditors are to be guided by the US insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Fifth District Court of Appeal says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would indicate a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Basically, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for Unification of International Commercial Law was created, which arbitrates the organization of the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment states that without the voting of the branches in the internal structure of the enterprise, where the debt of the parent company Vitro towards the branches is recognised, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this possibility is allowed by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts were covered by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after the deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors – who stood against Vitro in the U.S. courts, i.e. the “sup funds” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited – would not reach a majority.
In the vote they would have reached about 45 percent against 37.
This fact is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different perspective, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, Gonzáleze Sady’s family firm will appeal for a new assessment directly to the Court of Appeal, so that the assessment will take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because originally only three voted.
If it fails here, it will request a review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court, as an appeal.
What is important in the case is that the court has omitted a document sent by the Mexican Government as amicus curiae, which describes in detail Vitro’s conduct under the Insolvency Act and indicates that the company has relieved itself by adhering to agreements signed by both countries to confront that law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
In addition, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall Assessment
Unnoticed, a criminal complaint by the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of the enterprise, Gaston Azcárraga Andradem, which was accused of fraud was on the table for several months, and according to the union of pilots, the container has already leaked.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructing justice.
According to her, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which 198 million pesos were collected from the fideicomis F/589 of the bank IXE on behalf of the Mexican Air Force.
The funds were likely directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mars
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered at the Universidad de Caribe campus over the weekend to approve the creation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Cancun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trade and distribution center with products from the “great wall country” focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone at the bottom for employees from 150 companies.
The organization Canacintra (Camera Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has already managed to unite the governors of the Southeast Zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate the protected areas and which is the source of all resistance to industry.
The end of ACTA
The Senate’s request, which was not taken into consideration by the government and requested an explanation of under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term

This series is the first of four identical, offering interest repayment every 28 days.
Born Competitive
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has created a competitive association aimed at the software services market in Central and South America.
The investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of local basketball history as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes has.
Reyes had been involved in the sport for more than 60 years before he suffered a stroke on a wheelchair in 2008, whether as a younger player, a player of the BSN National Basketball League, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón National Basketball League team, or president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general manager of the national team and the president of the federation,” Reyes recalled while visiting reporters at his home in Bayamon, where he has lived for more than 50 years with his faithful wife, Isabel.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and souvenir items from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest movement of all the guards are those that recall his performance in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
“That was my best years, the ones I the most, because I had the opportunity to participate with the Los Vaqueros since 1967 in eight championships, whether as a owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship – in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
At that time, the team took over “Cuco” Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader,” Reyes said.
“I remember when Gene Bartow, who was a former coach at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, told me, ‘I have a two-meter-long player for you.
Do you want him?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon a championship victory, then Gausse will contribute to the next."
Gausse the championship for the Los Vaqueros team, but only at a distance, since he had already served as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy’s position in the national team.
“I remember the first time we defeated the United States at the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we finished quarter, but we should have had the bronze if not the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final pitch," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite was the national team at the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and swept out the team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that blown out the bronze at the World Cup.
That team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopez and “Piculín” (Ortiz), but there were also the youths (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had a perfect composition but managed to win a gold medal and bring great joy was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualifying in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the list such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players excluded due to a fight at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we have won gold.
Who was Puerto Rico’s best player?
It was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his performance in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best coach?
This is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla.
What is your biggest success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s the BSN national league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see a contribution in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I am pleased.
What are you dealing with now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, who was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was world famous for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted relentlessly and was conspicuous and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died on Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer, according to the family’s official announcement to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros.
“Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he has played the iconic role he loved most,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who represented his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
“He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him very much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before broadcasting Dallas, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (the gin) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performances in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman’s masterpiece in the form of the incredibly repugnant J.R. that brought him to the star-top.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan “Who Shoot Jayara?”, which was meant to arouse expectations about the thrilling work, when Hangman’s character is almost murdered, has caused not only a huge array of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in rates.
This has also helped to a record in viewing.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, had an average of 41 million television viewers.Dallas became the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the MASH series in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his brother-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. became pregnant and he then threatened to call her a prostitute if she did not leave the city.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be: “Here lies the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only thing he failed.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on the canvas and beyond."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to the millions of fans in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have already been filmed and the sixth is just being filmed," the TV station said.
Immediately after Hangman’s death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in classical works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the theater scenes in New York and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, with whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t put anything that I knew could hurt someone or hurt them in some way,” he told the press.
After a liver transplant, he started promoting organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go for surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of “don’t worry, it will be a bit annoying for a while, but you’ll be healthy.”
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course exploring the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would be a course on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long number" of the Maya calendar, which is due to come on December 21, has caught many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call “the debt Armageddon,” and the growing conflict in which Israel is entangled, the place where, according to Christians theorizing the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When one considers what is happening in the world today as if we had 30 days left, it’s really a good time.
And remember that bad means good for apocalyptic thinking.
And it’s not the only professor offering courses on the “end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the latest in history.
At Temple University, expert assistant Barry Vacker hosts a course on "Middles, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re uncovering why these ideas are expanding over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behaviors.
If, for example, nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, a war can break out.
This month, students analyze films on apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” says Vacker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, gathered together to organize a course called The End of the World.
“We’re not attaching ‘2012’ because we’re always counting on the possibility of arranging the course again in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “threatening ruin,” students have to study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the evening of the expected end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become very popular.
"It stretched out in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students enrolled by 35.
For weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails asking if there was still room.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, 23, a religion and sociology student at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
And so apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of an hour before in which this could be taught,” he said.
“I enjoy it.”
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, has said that he believes in the end date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Maya predictions, and in a way we are refuting them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
“The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar,” Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety dating back several centuries, by which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The rise of this speculation was caused by the Internet.
“People don’t think about it elsewhere,” he said.
This is the case mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew of any course there on “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, suggesting an exception to the Supreme Office.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the Last Judgment have been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several of them said they intended to go to the "end of the world" celebration.
"I'll probably call a few friends to laugh together," explained 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
