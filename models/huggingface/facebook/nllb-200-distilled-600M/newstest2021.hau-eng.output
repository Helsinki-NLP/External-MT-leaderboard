Former Federal Assembly Speaker, Yakubu Dogara has explained some of the reasons why he left the PDP and joined the APC.
Not to be forgotten Former Federal Assembly President, Yakubu Dogara had been a stalwart of the PDP, returning to the APC this week.
Dogara said that after standing up to the insult of PDP governor Bala in Bauchi state who helped the farmers win the 2019 elections, he had better rally and leave the party and return to his APC.
The main reason I left left was the way the PDP is governing in Bauchi state.
Everyone knows my role in the election of the governor of the state where the former Abuja minister, Bala Mohammed defeated the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I am a disgraceful and disgraceful part of Bala's government.
Instead of staying in the PDP, I was given the opportunity to avoid giving them a seat, and go back to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a letter of resignation from the PDP which he sent to the leader of his party's electorate, Bogoro C, in Bauchi state.
Finally, he said that, as he had often shown the other governors where they had failed and where they could improve in the past, he too was not anointed or anointed.

CORONA: We have not yet completed the testing of the drug in Nigeria.
While European countries continue to test the efficacy of their own combination of Corona drugs, Nigeria is also nowhere to be left behind in the mixing and testing of its own drugs.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing up to 40 Corona drugs that have been submitted to the agency by traditional medicine manufacturers.
The chairman of the Mojisola Adeyeye board announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the drug's efficacy was being tested to avoid any potential revenge on the obesity test.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional medicine practitioners have been scrutinising to see if they have been left behind in the process of finding a cure.
Many have submitted their products to the authorities for testing and validation.
The NAFDAC also sets out a set of rules and regulations for the preparation of the drug.
The efficacy of the drug will be tested on animals for the first time in advance.
Mojisola warned drug users not to dare to try any drug without the agency's permission.
In May, the NAFDAC announced that only social media and newspaper pages saw reports of those claiming to have discovered a traditional cure for the coronavirus.
Adeyeye said that even one person had approached the NAFDAC to ask to check the quality of the medicine he claimed to have incorporated traditional medicine, which he claimed could cure Coronavirus.
The other man, too, did not claim to have discovered the cure.
That he had discovered a cure for the symptoms of illness that were thought to be the symptoms of infection.

APC accuses the Governor of Niger of trying to bring chaos to the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC on Tuesday this week, it accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting riots within the party.
The document, signed by the Party Chairman of the Engineers Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Party Secretary Barista Muhammed Liman, states that during the six years the party has ruled the state, it has received only 512 million Naira.
The document went on to say that the meeting of stakeholders convened by the governor, which he chaired last Sunday night, would help to continue the riots in the party, where they said they had written to the national party secretary about the state's ongoing events.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the party's leaders by holding a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, because any complaints against the party leaders are in writing to the party secretary, so that they investigate".
He went on to say that so far in the six years since the party was founded, there have been 512 million naira in the party's bank accounts.
He said, his only understanding as governor was to be in the National Detention Committee which was set up on July 25, 2020, which was headed by the president to lead the resolution of disputes between the party members and withdraw the complaints in court between the party members.
The money we receive from paying the salaries of the party secretariat staff, and other party-related activities, the election of the candidates and the resolution of other party problems such as health care payments due to lack of access to government funding, no party money we have spent illegally, we challenge anyone who brings us the evidence of party financing.
As I mentioned, the last local elections in the state were the most important elections in the country which we have conducted with former commissioners and commissioners who are currently holding the power in all 25 local governments in the state, whose funds spent on the elections were distributed among the commissioners to their constituents.
It is therefore wrong for anyone to say that the party's money is being spent illegally, it is almost unfair to try to defend the bad guy and try to hang him, that there is no committee to be set up to investigate how the party's money was spent and who set it up.
Of the money the complainant claimed that the money he alleged was bribed, it was money provided by the national party secretary, no other money like that so I challenge anyone on this issue to bring his testimony to prove his accusation in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm in defending the APC from any attempt to undermine the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written to the committee responsible for its defence as set out in section 21 (B) (ii), (d) of page 82 of the party constitution.
Therefore, the party's stakeholders have no role to play, especially if they attempt to seize the power of the committee and their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most trusted party leaders in the state, under Article 21 and paragraph 6 of page 87 of the party constitution, anything that is contrary to this will not be used.
Because the decision to be biased by the leaders to keep you is wrong.
He said those who presented the document with the approval of the party at the meeting that he did not promote, led by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the watermen and the central party will be headed by the party's leader Engineer Mohammed Imam and not the governor will lead the state party leaders.
The document added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the pledge made to the state's people during the election, and the party's parents' journey in government so that everyone in the state and all sections can benefit by holding political positions, which is a problem for both governor and party.
The bill praised the federal legislators who refused to attend the meeting and called for a settlement of all the issues between the members of the party, which is not surprising for the members of the parliament who you know are sick, to have refused to accept the arrest as a party law.
Therefore, it is necessary for the chairman of the National Detention Committee to appeal to the governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the proper position not to attempt to overthrow the state's politics.

How food allergens affect the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists warn people against eating foods that contain antioxidants that are harmful to human health.
The researchers issued this warning after a study of the quality of food in the country.
The results suggest that certain foods are contaminated with chemicals to prevent them from rotting.
The study also found that the chemical was used primarily in beans, pulses, and dried fish products.
The chemical is used so that when a person sees it, he will be attracted to it.
Then eating foods containing this chemical can lead to cancer, kidney disease, heart attack, and more.
The indigenous people are urged to be careful not to consume such foods for their health.
Not to be forgotten, a food quality expert Grace Olasumbo has urged Nigerians to avoid eating vegetables that have been ground with calcium carbide.
Olasumbo explains that Calcium Carbide Citrate is the most common chemical used by traders in the milling of raw wood, vegetables.
Research shows that lack of patience and enthusiasm are among the reasons why traders use this chemical because it is a one-day product.
Olasumbo said that one thing that marketers fail to recognize is that the use of this chemical to promote vegetables has serious health risks.
As a result, infections such as diarrhea, diarrhea, eye pain, stomach ulcers, throat, mouth, liver and other diseases are spread.

A panel of experts led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has cleared the head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of the allegations of bribery.

Mr Adesina was previously subject to an investigation by the US government, following a fraud by the AfDB's banking board, which led to the formation of an expert panel to investigate the corruption.

COVID-19 Banned the Trump Election Campaign in Florida.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he had cancelled the Republican Party's ticketing convention scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, due to the rise in coronavirus cases.
Nevertheless, the convention's activities were to be conducted in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a convention at this time was not appropriate.
President Trump moved part of the GOP rally to Florida last month after they had a dispute with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding the rally in a closed hall with his supporters without wearing a mask.
A few Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to elect Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would deliver a confidence speech in a different format.
Trump, who has been showing a months-long disregard for the impact of the pandemic, also recently said that 99% of cases seen in the United States have increased, would not have any effect.

China Achieves Successes in Enriching Its People with Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the life-giving spirit of all living things, and food alone is vital.
That is why the Chinese authorities are increasingly involved in ensuring the nation's food supply.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made great achievements in food supply, which surprised the world to see the country's population, which according to estimates has over 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort helped to make China a major contribution to the global fight against hunger, as the head of the Chinese Grain and Crop Conservation Agency Zhang Wufeng once stated that, since 1949 and up to now, China has always put the fight against hunger at the forefront of all national administration.
But recently, some people and Western media have "re-expressed concern" about whether China can feed its own nation in the shadow of the global COVID-19 respiratory epidemic.
We are so grateful to the new ones who are always taking care of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved a sufficient food supply based on its man-made efforts.
Providing enough food for the Chinese is one of the main daily agenda of the ruling JKS party.
Last weekend, the Secretary General of the JKS Supreme Council, the President of China, Xi Jinping issued a key order to stop food stamping, pointing out that everyone knows that any food stamps and hard work are available.
Although this year the impact of the global COVID-19 respiratory pandemic is also affecting China's economy, China can still provide enough food for its people.
Statistics of China's agricultural production, especially rice production in 2020, show that the country's rice production in the first half of 2020 was 27.29 million tonnes, an increase of 1.08 million tonnes, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
He also said that China has made significant progress in terms of food supply and food supply compared to the early implementation of the policy of domestic reform and opening the door to foreign countries.
Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Institute at Peking University, said in an interview with the "China Science Daily" newspaper that the biggest challenge China is facing now is whether within the next two or three years, China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in its grain storage facilities.
Now the average annual output of grain per person is 474 kilograms, instead of the 400 kilograms that a person in the world should have.
And now China is importing millions of tons of agricultural products for livestock farming alone.
Those who express concern should calm down, bathe, go to bed, or concentrate on domestic matters.
Chinese can feed themselves with food they produce.

Only qualified, in the form of a qualification process in 2023.
My brother-in-law and close friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura said that the receptionist regime in Nigeria is now outdated.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already made progress and has now abandoned the admissions process in order to focus on the most eligible candidates in 2023.
The BBC has published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he explained this.
This electoral process in Nigeria has not produced a son-in-law who has been in office since 1999.
Instead, Daura suggests that the focus be on the qualified candidate, not on the receiving process.
But the Igbo people, the Inyamirai, responded to Daura's remarks.
They said that only if he and his brother President Buhari have secured the throne by acceptance will he come out now and recommend that this is not done in 2023.
Buharin himself is not the most elected Nigerian.
The top security officials of the country who have been sitting in their seats for decades have not been removed, nor are they more capable than others.
The Answer of the Female.
A political storm hit the Nigerian presidency on Wednesday, as the Igbo Zalla Movement, Ndigbo, dissolved Mamman Daura, over the Nigerian president's remarks against the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, who is the cousin of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that there will be a shi'a-shi'a system in the 2023 presidential election.
Since his comments were not yet published on social media, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement condemning Mamman Daura, calling him a partial fat bully.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo community in the South Region, and in the case of the South Eastern Province, will be allowed to run for president in the 2023 elections, which is the same Igbo tribe.
The spokesperson for the Igbo Zalla Tribal Association, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's comments as a presidential candidate in Nigeria in 2023 were against the Igbo people.
Apart from greed, why hasn't Mamman Daura been talking about welcoming since 2019.
They were about to fire Jonathan, and now Daura is running for the South Region to run for president of Nigeria in the 2023 election.
He will only finish the story of what he has been kissing from his brother who is now the president of this country, and then he will come up with a new topic that we do not know about for the 2023 presidential election.

The VOA's Rape Room.
The issue of rape of women and children is common in northern Nigeria where reports have emerged of child rights being violated.
On July 23, people from various backgrounds gathered at the hall to discuss the worsening situation in the country and how to deal with it.
The participants attributed the problem to such things as the advertising of girls and the neglect of some parents.
One of the mothers attending the Hajiya conference Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of former governor of the state of Philato-Negara under the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the reasons parents put advertising on their children.
Hajiya Maryam mamman Nasir, head of a campaign to combat the disaster, said: "First we should go around and inform mothers about the dangers of letting their children go out to the market, because only when a child goes out will he be seen and hurt".
We will also call on Teachers to begin preaching out loud to parents and siblings who abuse their children.

'North Media Writers' Movement to the North.
Modern social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have long played a role in creating forums of discussion, collaboration and interaction among different communities around the world, with the delivery of messages, news, and dissemination of political, educational and business objectives.
Young Nigerians are taking part in this new technology by using social media, to keep up with the times, and to contribute or express themselves in the news that affects their lives.
We can say that these halls have brought us many advances that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the business, economic, educational and political areas of the region.
Many are eaten by texting, emailing, finding jobs, or improving their jobs.
But it is sad to see how, instead of some youths taking advantage of this opportunity to take advantage of the progress made, others have followed the corrupt children of the southern country who have become world leaders in public corruption, both domestically and abroad, or in the filing of pornography and the abuse of rulers and ancestors.
What a lack of civilization that is in the youth's development in this country.
The arrival of the North Media Writers Association in the country is a great achievement, to provide the youth of the North with a better understanding and clean up of the activities of the youth in Social Media, so that they can be meaningful writers and promoters of the policies of the North.
We must give this organization the necessary cooperation, in order to achieve its charitable goals, which will benefit not only our Northern region but also Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youth, especially social media users, to come together to defend the dignity and independence of the North, and to create a system that will bring about change for all.
Like our Northern leaders who slept on the right such as the Sardaans of Sakkwato, the first Prime Minister of the North Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his closest allies aspired to create a Northern nation.
It is reported that the late anti-violence and poverty leader Prof. Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, certainly as we call for national development and better governance, at every step, we are calling for the unity of the people of the North, without religious or racial discrimination, to bring about the development of our region.
The North was not so much the North as it is now.
So we should use our God-given skills to make contributions and recommendations, to provide a satisfactory way for the North to recover its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition to the development of the North, we attach great importance to education, agriculture, tourism, healthcare and science and technology.
We can donate money in many ways.

Here is a list of the death toll in 21 states that the report enumerates.
Kaduna - 139 Barno - 113 Katsina - 80 Kori - 17 Nasarawa - 13 Taraba - 10 Benuwai - 9 Ebonyi - 8 Zamfara - 7 Plateau - 5 Edo - 2 Akwa Ibom - 2 Lagos - 2 Oyo -1 Ogun - 1 Bayelsa - 1 Delta -1 Kebbi - 1.

The federal government has the right to protect public life, but those closest to these people should be the first to say that we think we have a problem with these things.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is doing its best to promote agriculture and food production in the country.

Criminal Justice in Nigeria Is the Only Solution
A classroom activist in Kaduna state Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje pointed out that the death penalty for rape victims in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that if the authorities confirm this after an investigation, the death penalty is the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the number of rapes that could be easily obtained, but the easiest thing was to correct our minds.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, "It is our Muslim master that we should serve Allah and the Prophet and stand up and correct our hearts, because you never know when you will die.
What a shame it would be to be told that a full-grown man or an elderly man would have a little girl of three months, three or five years old, raped.
He went on to say that, in the face of God, we should not insult the rulers, or national rulers, pointing out that there is no way to achieve success if such a crisis occurs.
He added that this is why we are in a state of distress and suffering in the country, because the country has not progressed, the kings themselves, the governors and the president, have lost their way to deal with the situation.
He added that they had to sew the bar and the moon was opened so we had to change our minds so that God could solve the rape case.
He declared that, even if they were doing it for personal gain, everything should be in the eyes of God because he is the one who wipes out all sorrow and poverty in mankind.
He said that whatever situation you go through, God knows you can do nothing but die and go through the cycle and you always think you're going to die and you always think you're going to die, and you're going to die.
He pointed out that the police are also officially doing their best to send the same alleged rapists to Kotukuma Alkali for their best efforts in this tragic event, both in our region of Northern Nigeria and across the country.
He urged parents in particular to keep a close eye on their children, citing the example of advertising that their parents put on them that adds to the problem.
He said that some parents do not follow the lives of their children whether they go to school or not or come home on time or not, adding that the fault is partly the negligence of other parents because they should know that God gave them children and tomorrow the day will ask them about what kind of education they have given their children.

Farmers in the Biniwe of Harvest and Place in the Kakar Bana - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Biniwe State expect to harvest a lot about two months after planting.
Some of them, tattooed in Makurdi, expressed hope that the harvest would occur anytime between October and November.
Titus Atondo, a small farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, says that he planted his own rice in a two-acre tract in July.
Atondo said he obtained seeds from the market in his area and they were in two groups of CP and OC rice while using Dazzle chemicals to clear the fields for planting crops and fertilising.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of growing rice in rural areas such as mines are so great because we rely so heavily on labour as customers cannot access farm roads.
Titus Atondo added that we hired people to work in agriculture from the ground up to the harvest, adding that this was exhausting and abundant.
Atondo said all the expenses spent on his farm which are currently there include planting, cleaning, fertilisation and harvesting are expected to reach N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he expected at least 50 bags of grain to be harvested from two acres and perhaps sold at a price of Naira 29,000 per 100k bag.
He also a leading rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted in June to July on 274 acres of land at a cost of 14,500 Naira per hectare while the land cost 25,000 Naira per hectare.
He has sown 44 (Supi) and 61 (OC) seeds obtained from the National Organic Agricultural Council (NCA) and some are sourced from Olam Nigeria.
He added that the growth rates during this period were in different areas while others were in the process of breeding, and others were in the initial stages of killing animals as farms were being farmed in stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far included financial ones as the cost of producing the cattle of choice was high and labor costs increased.
The harvest is expected to begin in October-November.
He added that the total cost of raw materials at the end of the day will be at the lowest of Naira 246,000 per hectare while production is expected to be about three tonnes of honey which could translate to Naira 360,000 at the rate of Naira 120 per kilogram.
Tarnong does not use medicines on his rice fields, instead, he offers advice and practices on traditional farming, adding that, therefore, we use pesticides, pesticides and medicinal fertilizers extensively.
Also the chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) branch of Benue state, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, expressed hope that the rainy weather this year will be suitable for the cultivation of large quantities of rice.
According to the Chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) head of Benue state, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers were involved in the rice farming business later this year due to the coronavirus pandemic which prevented many people from leaving offices and remaining in their fields.
He said that this year it will harvest 20% of the production in 2019 which is estimated to be over one million tons.
According to him, the data collectors are currently taking the statistics of different types of farmers and once the project is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The president of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) Benue state branch, Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said he had grown three acres of rice fields, noted that some farmers had planted rice in June while those who were short-term farmers were doing so in the exact harvest time expected in late November or early December.
THE head of the AAN added that rice farmers use advanced materials to kill old weeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides.
Expressing concern about the animal problems threatening rice farming, he added that farmers were building fences, putting ropes and clearing the edges of the fields to solve the problem.

Nigerian students in Cyprus denied Abike Dabire's claim that students were being brutally murdered in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, TRCN, have denied the head of the Nigerian Immigration and Nationality Commission (NiDCOM), which warned parents not to send their children to Northern Cyprus, saying that child rapists are being committed.

Man's Fear Is King, and I Praise It.
The music video for Beyonce's song "Black is King" continues to receive worldwide praise and criticism for its portrayal of African culture.
In South Africa, where this 85-minute film was made, many said that it was even more than a movie.
Black is King, a musical film directed, mixed and completed by the famous American singer-songwriter Beyonce.
The film was similar to her song "The Lion King: The Gift".
The film was shot last year in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and features several African musicians.
The film, released in July, was well received by audiences, but it also received critical acclaim.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, U.S.A., illegally borrowed African material, especially African-style images, while she was not traditionally African.
But in South Africa, the people who played a part in the film were also very happy.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student who read about the film industry, said that he was honored to be included in the cast.
He said that he was impressed by the film.
The film touched on many of the lessons about the history of blacks that were not taught in school.
He says that when he saw the film, he also saw the story and the clothes she wore and the rest of the film, which produced more than expected.
Kgosi Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce's music, said that Africans abroad - including black Americans - have the opportunity to use what some consider to be African cultural heritage.
He was the only one who liked the movie.
Kgosi said that black women are mostly on the national level in the society.
So their development in such influential matters is encouraging.
A student of filmmaking, Mathebula says Beyonce's film made him want to start directing the film in order to spread more information about Africa.
African fans of Beyonce have been adamant about one thing: If the Mouth of Man is King, then Beyonce is a queen.

Minister Sadiya commended the journalists and aid workers.
Nigeria's Minister of Relief and Compassion, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk, praised the efforts of the media, aid workers and cooperative agencies on the occasion of the one-year anniversary of the founding of the ministry.
It is the same institution that was created by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 21, 2019 to implement humanitarian policies and activities, disaster prevention and emergency response, and then to run humanitarian aid programs.
In a statement shared by media volunteer Halima Oyelade, the ministry considered that this was a multi-faceted, challenging and exciting year in which we learned about community relief and disaster management, but in all activities we focused on fulfilling our mandate which included community response, disaster prevention and relief for disaster victims, and disaster relief efforts in case of disaster, which helped us improve our work for the future.
While praising the President for his vision of creating a ministry that is at the forefront of fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk thanked him for placing her in the driver's seat of his ministry.
She also feels that during that one year, she has learned important lessons and has gained new insight into the open and open ways of doing this work.
While praising the media, the ministry said that these trips were companions with whom it was necessary to combine forces to succeed.
"I want to make it clear today that you are doing the right thing", she said.
She also said that not because her funeral was the one that gave her the credit for her achievements, but because she and her colleagues were willing to continue their work in dedication and commitment to fulfill their work commitments, which matched their one-year theme of Service2Humanity.
The Minister expressed her special appreciation to "the humanitarian workers and our partners in this sector from the UN agencies such as OCHA, IOM, UNHCR and the Agency, the World Food Bank, USAID and the European Union (EU), and other cooperative agencies who continue to provide assistance despite the current insecurity and crisis situation.
She also spoke out about the number of people who have died in insecure areas in the past year.
The minister explained that the one year anniversary of the establishment of the ministry has forced them to persevere.
"As we celebrate our one-year anniversary", she says, "I would like to say that it is time to get back to our roots".
We must find ways to expand disaster relief, relief, and relief efforts that will help us to improve our work in the future.

At a time when farmers in Nigeria were struggling to reap the benefits of their crops, farmers in Sokoto State began to struggle with the threat of bird feeding, which could hamper the expected crop yield.
The threat of the redbirds in Sokoto State of being happy has returned, as there are signs of a good food season in 2020.
Some local farmers have adopted a traditional method of expelling the birds, as explained by a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, says that the birds are now eating all the plants that have begun to bloom in the fields.
The head of the Nigerian Farmers Association Sokoto State Branch, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that two-thirds of Sokoto State is currently facing this problem.
He also said that they are now waiting to hear the situation of the local authorities in the state to compile a report to the state and federal agriculture department to take action to help farmers.
The official of the federal ministry of agriculture in charge of the avian and insect medicine department, Yau Maƙeri Kagara, said that the spraying of the poultry medicine in the Sokoto region was completed in less than a month.
He added that the birds were imported from Niger and Benin, and international trade had to be negotiated before a joint solution could be reached.
In June, the federal government launched a bird-destruction campaign in 12 northern Nigerian states that are neighbouring countries where the birds are imported into Nigeria.
Only a resurgence in the crisis could put the economy back on track for the perceived growth in agriculture that governments claim to be paying special attention to.

The King of African Hausa asked students to learn to speak the Hausa language - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The King of the Hausa Africans and the Governor of Agadaz State Dr. Abdulkadir Narayana, demanded that students focus on learning and managing the Hausa language.
Dr. Abdulkadir Newsar explained this today through his "Bye Bye Hantsi" program on Freedom Radio, which focused on International Hausa Day to be held on Wednesday.
The article also notes that the Haitian language plays a role in promoting Baha'i culture, saying that young people are now trying to borrow the culture of other languages from someone who is not right.
According to him, Haitian had a global influence in 59 countries, which allowed them to dominate some of the Haitian languages.
Also a participant in the program, the head of the national Hausa student association Professor Nura Sulaiman Janburji, said that Haitian language is so sacred that in foreign countries students are allowed to establish a kingdom.
The two leaders called on governments at all levels to press for the language to be used in the national parliaments in order to protect its legitimacy in the eyes of the world.

New COVID-19 Support Bill to be reintroduced in the United States.
While statistics show that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in the United States, Republicans in the Senate are expected to present a bill Monday.
The grant is expected to cost $1 trillion to alleviate the strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The program comes days before the expiry of the first financial aid deadline for the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Sunday, after days of discussions with Republicans in the House, U.S. Treasury chief Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the grant included expanding the program to provide assistance to those who lost their jobs.
But they say that this time, Americans will see 70 percent of the money they've been given before.
On Friday, the first aid term will cover the amount of compensation paid to those who lost their jobs, and 600 will be paid each week in addition to the state-granted amount.
"Republicans complain that this scheme means that some people are paid more than they are paid during their working life, when combined with federal and state subsidies.
But "Democrats, on their part, have challenged the bill, saying that seeing the coronavirus epidemic increase, some workers are not feeling comfortable enough to return to work.

The reason I joined the APC after leaving the PDP.
Former Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has explained the reasons why he switched from the PDP to the APC after the incumbent leader of the Malala Buni Party announced his return to their Party.
In a letter to the PDP in his Bogoro constituency, Dogara said the collapse of the leadership in his Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed government which helped him win was the reason he left the party.
The trusted man could not open his mouth and ask questions about how the state government was run unless he was accused of disobedience, so he climbed the shoe and left the Party.
The former head of the council said that if he wrapped his hands in war, anything about how bad things were going on in Bauchi State under Bala Muhammed's rule would be a traitor, after at the time Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar had heard his voice express his opinion if he was wrong.

The Federal Government has launched a program of agriculture to provide food and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agriculture for Food Production and Employment Program (AFGP), which is a branch of the Sustainable Economic Development Programme.
This farming scheme was launched to reduce the hardship of farmers due to the Coronavirus outbreak.
This statement was made by Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, during the launch of the program in Katsina.
The press release of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, was released on Thursday.
This initiative will address the hardships faced by people as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak in the country and around the world.
The scheme will also increase the awareness of farmers about the ways in which food can be grown, processed and transported in Nigeria.
The Minister reportedly said that the inaugural event was attended by over 1,100,000 small farmers across the country.
He said these numbers of over 1 million small farmers, 100,000, are part of the Farmers Group under six companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agriculture and Oxfam.
Soon we will identify a second group, B, of those who will benefit from this agricultural arrangement.
Nanono recalled how President Muhammadu Buhari set up the Recovery and Reinvestment Committee from disabled people after the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said one of the ways to revive the country's economy, including the AFJP Program, would be to develop agriculture from being a hand-held-hand-held crop to a modern and rich food producer.
He said the plan included a government-led program to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of food to help the poor from the shortage and hunger crisis during the coronavirus pandemic.
He said that within a year this ambitious program would provide between 5 million and 10 million young people with employment opportunities.
And it would produce about 10 million metric tons of food per hectare from 20,000 to 100,000 per state, for at least 2.4 million farmers.

A New Law on Registration of Worship Places is Under Controversy in Nigeria.
The human rights and economic development group SERAP called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reprimand Nigerian Justice Minister Abubakar Malama and the Director General of the Registration Board for the suspension of the registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, this measure is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's move, various religious leaders had also filed complaints with the Buhari government, saying the bill should be returned to the Congress for review and approval, so that it would not violate constitutional freedom of religion and well-being.
Pastor John Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna state, told a voice of America representative that the law was baseless, even unarmed, as if the government were seeking to ban worship or impose sanctions.
She should simply take advantage of the opportunities by monitoring and following all lawbreakers without imposing any new rule.
For his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, a lecturer at the University of Science in Minna said that while it is not a crime for the government to monitor companies and organizations for national security, it does not mean that the strict consent to restrict the freedom of one or others is not allowed.
It remains to be seen whether the government will listen to this public outcry.

How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) attempted to destroy the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken over a crackdown on websites, in order to bring down the PREMIUM TIMES, the leading online newspaper in Nigeria.
The hackers have tried to hack into the internet, but they have failed.
He began his "hacking" habit on February 28, when he dropped his weapons on the campus of the university, and used the university's "data" to carry out his attacks.
On the other hand, if he tried to hack into the PREMIUM TIMES Internet drive with a computer, he would attack again with his GSM phone.
He spent five days waiting for the portal to the PREMIUM TIMES Main Library, but was unsuccessful, despite using the most sophisticated technology available.
He failed to break in, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES had a master plan, which he built a wall and a bridge with a door that a highwayman could not break.
Then PREMIUM has a number of senior security officers for its modern Web-based database including the PREMIUM TIMES War King and the PREMIUM TIMES Web Protector.
These security officers were modern-day experts in crushing any gang or bards who tried to make a stand alone, or making a martyr-like attempt to attack the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The types of weapons that a hacker used to attack the PREMIUM TIMES website:
At 8 a.m., he began to slide out the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Hall, to see how he would sneak in and destroy the hall.
If he failed the night before, and the next morning, at 6:15 a.m., he tested his luck again, this time using "WPScan", a technique used to detect the strength or weakness of PREMIUM TIMES' security measures.
Within 90 minutes, he was attempting to hack into the power of modern computer technology, the "custom script".
The next morning, he tried his best to hack into the computer's shutter to lock down the PREMIUM TIMES site completely.
How a Farmer Deals with the Monkey's Speck:
The hacker was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had been trying to cure small rats and large cities entering their modern social media farms by closing a page or seizing a sukut page.
This ignorance of his caused all the tools he used, entirely old ones that could not harm PREMIUM TIMES.
He was tired of the day's unnecessary hardship as he followed through with a DDOS attack on the NTP Likau Dam, an ancient method used since Kano village.
On March 3, he tried all the rest of his brain and mind, but all of them failed.
The attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES General Archives came a few days after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of a clash between President Muhammadu Buhari's Security Advisor, Babagana Monguno and former Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, the late Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure told PREMIUM TIMES that the university had recruited a group of big rats who were hacking into websites to hack, destroy or destroy the PREMIUM TIMES database.
But by contacting FUTA university, PREMIUM TIMES has distanced itself from the attempt to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Archive.
FUTA said that unless a student at the university tried to do so alone, there was no FUTA.

While the Kano State Government has cut its budget for the year by about 70 billion naira due to the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the state economy, the state legislature has passed a new law regulating the state government's financial system.
But local government activists say that the issue of creating a law is a simple matter, but its implementation is a challenge.
The creation of a new direction for the administration of public finances on a democratic basis is part of the objective of the new law in Kano State which has been developed in recent years at the federal level and also in other states of Nigeria.
The majority leader of the Kano state legislature, Honarabul Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told Voice of America that the bill would give the ministries and state governments a guideline on how to spend their money, along with how the state would allocate its funds.
The local government activists have recently welcomed the bill, as long as it is regularly reviewed.
The Director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali said they hope the government officials, and the state government will implement the law properly.
But the Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Affairs Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah said they were well prepared to work with the law and order.
The new law was already signed by the governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, last weekend, and is expected to come into force immediately.

INEC has prepared for the election of Edo - Professor Jacob.
The chairman of the National Election Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, said that his commission has prepared for the holding of the Edo State governor's election, which will be held on September 19.
Jacob made this encouraging statement on Thursday, when he was meeting with the Election Control Liaison Committee in Benin, the capital of Edo State.
The professor said that INEC has so far successfully implemented 10 of the 14 plans it has set out to implement in relation to the election.
James added that the purpose of this visit was to see the preparations that had already begun before the election day approached.
We certainly receive all reports of the ongoing programs.
Yet, we find it appropriate to come to our senses, so that our eyes may be clear.
The agency has released a timetable for how the Edo and Ondo elections will be held, starting on February 6, 2020.
We then gave up about seven to eight months to prepare for the two options.
So today I am happy that we have implemented 10 of the 14 plans that INEC has planned to implement.
And no one was found to be in possession of any of the property until it was released from the date of execution.
The final step is to restrict the total number of voters to the 14 parties that will contest the Inji Jacobs.
He said the four tasks left to INEC included publishing the election announcement to be held next Tuesday, presenting the candidates of each party, all on the same day.
Then stop the campaign 24 hours before the election.
The 12th election campaign will be called off Thursday night, the Saturday before the election.
So we're just saying we've already done a lot of checking, just waiting for the election day to come.
According to Jacob.
He also predicted that the Edo state governor's election would be the first election to be held by INEC during the coronavirus.
He said the election commission had issued rules on how to conduct elections in the current situation.
We tested the system and the rules in a small, full-scale election in Nasarawa State.
And we planned to repeat the process at this general election in Edo.

Atyap, Hausa-Fulani Accorded Peace Between Them.
The Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities living in Zangon Kataf Municipality of Kaduna State have successfully completed a reconciliation meeting, in order to create lasting peace in their region.
The delegates, who expressed their determination to maintain peace and forgiveness, opposed the massacre and the plundering of property in their territory.
They also announced their intention to help the security authorities with their private information, to capture any civilians they hid in their areas.
The meeting also commended the government's efforts to deploy security forces in the region, as well as praised the various youth organizations based on the elders for their embrace and distance from any potential threats to the region as well as the efforts of their youth to ensure the successful establishment of this reconciliation agreement between them.
The meeting, held under the leadership of Agwatyap ruler Dominic Gambo John, provided a meeting of the three communities, to discuss the creation of peace.
The meeting was held at the Maria and Jacob Ebent Centre in the Wakili District.
The meeting also included ABM chairman Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr Salim Umar, who represented the Atyap kingdom, for reconciliation between the communities and for an end to bloodshed and the destruction of the properties that represented them.
The post-conference document was signed by all three Atyap leaders, Fulani and Hausa, including the late ruler Agwatyap.
In the post-conference letter containing 14 letters, the residents of Atyap Kingdom called on you and someone else to take the law into their own hands, instead of appealing to the security authorities.
The meeting also highlighted the constitutional assurance given to every Nigerian to live independently in any part of the country where he is in need, including the Atyap Kingdom, without fear or threat from anyone in any way.
The assembly also urged the authorities to expedite the return of all the refugees to their homes.
The assembly also proposed the establishment of a peacekeeping committee composed of the Hausa, Fulani, Atyap and their youth to organize conferences and discussions on security issues from time to time to promote peace in their kingdom.
The peace talks came hours after the Kaduna State government relaxed its state of emergency in the districts of Zangon Kataf and Kaura, in the state to prevent an outbreak of conflict among the local population.

As Ganduje replaced the rulers expelled by King Ado and Sanusi, he would make them the monarchs in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State Legislature to amend the state law 2019, so as to ensure the appointment of two other high-ranking Kano kings who resigned the late King Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, so that the state law will ensure their appointment as the highest crown prince in Kano.
The request was read by Kano Assembly Speaker Abdullahi Gafasa in front of the parliamentary hall, and they are expected to sit down to discuss the issue before the end of July.
The rulers who were restored to the Kano kingdom were Aminu the Great of Nyang'undi and, who later became the Dawaki Mai Tuta and Ciroman of Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
Both were removed by King Ado and King Muhammad Sanusi, accused of conspiracy.
The Chief of the Gang challenged him in court.
For 17 years, the case was pending until the Supreme Court ruled that he was a failure.
He was also the one Ganduje wanted to restore his rule, and by the reform of the law he was among the nominees in the Kano kingdom.
Ado Bayero removed Ndanagundi in 2003 after being convicted of conspiracy and meddling in political affairs.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was asked to refuse to appear before the committee in order to defend himself.
He then challenged his removal from Kano State High Court to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Great Friend should be restored to his seat.
But the Kano kingdom under the rule of Mohammaddu Sanunmsi II, appealed, where the Supreme Court affirmed his removal as the Head of the Eastern Region, and the King Dawaki Mai Tuta, on 5 June.
After Sanusi Bayero was removed, Ciroman Kano refused to recognize the reign of the newly appointed Emperor of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II in June, 2014.
Later, he was appointed as the head of the National Port Authority during Jonathan's time.
He was appointed Wamban of Kano, under the current Kano Emperor.

Effort, Commitment, and Self-Seeking - The Heart of Leadership
Longyuan Village of Hongsipu District of Wuzhong, Ningxia Province of the Hui Autonomous Nation, located in northwestern China.
There was a dedicated woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (a Muslim name for her) who was famous for her hard work and success in trying to break out of poverty.
Her story tells us that selfishness, self-sacrifice, and self-sacrifice are deep within the heart.
Initially, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, and never sat in class to take lessons, which made her unable to read foreign script.
But God gave her wisdom, skill, and rich wisdom, so that she became a model in warfare and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, who had been suffering from stomach cancer, underwent three surgeries.
After she woke up, she was in a terrible accident, and now she was walking with a steel strap on her foot.
These challenges put her in a difficult position not only in terms of health but also in terms of medical care, for which she accepted a loan of some 300,000 yuan, or over 16 million Naira.
Surprisingly, this challenge of Professor Sadiya turned into a way for her to get better.
Then the Chinese government's support gave her even more encouragement.
Her trade was to sprout a variety of herbs using herbs.
Thanks to her husband's efforts, my father's business prospered, where she was ordered to work in various departments.
She also invented a number of machines that made the work easier.
For example, it would take 15 minutes to connect one large stump, but now in that time, it would connect up to five.
She also developed additional machines that cleaned the weeds and reared the thorns.
Then there were more machines that cleaned animal feed for women, and now even sell those machines to applicants.
Considering the challenges that Professor Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she still makes to improve her and her staff's lives, it is clear that the applicant is certainly with me.
The struggle against poverty and the improvement of living conditions is not a matter for the government.
If the government provides support, but people are unwilling or unwilling to improve their lives by finding jobs for themselves, then only in the near future will there be no achievement of any goal.
Her experience shows that running a business or earning a living does not require a certain amount of money or travel to other cities or foreign countries.
She took her circumstances into account and used the resources available to her environment to improve her life.
Moreover, teacher Sadiya performed these tasks on her own without relying on her husband, who had run away from her.
That is, selfish effort, self-sacrifice, and self-sacrifice are deep within the heart.
He then showed how powerful women could be to change their lives and stand on their own two feet without asking for help from anyone.
This is also a lesson that one should stand firm in every endeavor, for trusting someone is uncertain.
Indeed, Master Sadiya was a dedicated, intelligent and resourceful woman who set an example and example for the rest of society.
Also, by March this year, Malama Sadiya had completed the repayment of all her debts, and then stopped receiving government subsidies on her own.

There is a fear that US politicians will foil efforts to contain COVID-19.
Recently, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the measures taken by other countries to preserve the COVID-19 respiratory vaccine expected to be produced, stating that priority should be avoided over the communities of different countries, while sharing the vaccine.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a fairly global manner, as this would be in line with the vast benefits of different countries.
Indeed, some US politicians have implemented a policy of self-interest, of sharing vaccines, and of undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
Among them, more than 800,000 have died from the disease.
Under such a critical environment, more attention is being paid to the vaccine's effectiveness, and fortunately, in recent days, there have been significant results in vaccine studies in other countries, which has given skin and confidence to the entire international community.
Sadly, however, some U.S. politicians have expressed a desire to take the vaccine.
Even Science magazine has clarified that the US government has already secured contracts for COVID-19 vaccines worth over $6 billion from several pharmaceutical companies.
While the US government's policy is understood, as the United States is at the forefront of the spread of the disease, other developing countries also need vaccines, considering that they are more vulnerable to shortage of healthcare resources.
The journal "The Ecologist" also noted that if the United States achieved its vaccine production target, the number of vaccines produced by developing countries would decrease.
Kazaza, director-general of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern about the issue.
As some commentators on the daily routine point out, even with the success of the vaccine, the post-pandemic goal is not achievable, but the distribution of vaccines is a matter of international importance.
And international cooperation needs to be strengthened.
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that, if the pandemic is to be seen, it must be contained from all areas around the world, and it is impossible for some parts of the world, or a few countries, to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects of the pandemic alone.

This was announced by the Secretary General of FEPSAN, Gideon Negedu, in an interview with the Banguard newspaper.
The Secretary General of FEPSAN, Gideon Negedu, spoke about the efforts of FEPSAN to tackle the polluting landfill projects in the country.
According to FEPSAN Secretary General Gideon Negedu, the cost of fertilizer, which is now legal, will help solve the problem.
FEPSAN Secretary General Gideon Negedu also said that this would also allow the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to use the law to punish anyone caught polluting modern fertilizer.
The Secretary General of FEPSAN, Mr Gideon Negedu, also issued two new poker numbers for the public to call to expose illegal offenders, such as 08175077773 and 08175777724.
According to FEPSAN's Secretary General Mr Gideon Negedu, wherever we want to go so far is to expand our channels or talk to farming groups so that they are in the spotlight of those involved and will report immediately.
He added that the organization has done a lot to reduce the amount of fertilizer, which is the only way we have done a lot.

The law was implemented in the law.
He said that any member of FEPSAN knows how to break the approach to fertilizer, and not only that, every member of FEPSAN is encouraged to ensure that he is monitoring the quality of his or her products because there are legal penalties in that law if it damages fertilizer.
FEPSAN General Secretary Mr Gideon Negedu announced, "We have worked on that and are working on that to ensure that together with the Ministry of Agriculture which is headed by them, they are enforcing the law".
General Secretary of FEPSAN Mr Gideon Negedu We are working with them to ensure that there is a good quality follow-up.
General Secretary of FEPSAN Mr Gideon Negedu said that FEPSAN has its own monitoring committee to work from time to time to investigate, but the idea is that as soon as we can get these items then we can now get the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Agricultural Engineering that implemented this law directly.

The President of South Africa Resents Contracts.
The South African president expressed his regret over the rampant corruption in the ruling ANC.
Cyril Ramaphosa, in a letter sent to all members of the ANC on Sunday, August 23, began by highlighting the ongoing rescue efforts on contracts to help the country fight the coronavirus pandemic.
The rescue was made possible by private companies and individuals, including government officials who used the medical, social and economic crisis to support themselves, the letter said.
This fraud is unforgivable for millions of South Africans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, who face daily hunger, and unemployment.
In the letter Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of dollars of national funds were identified to be spent on improving transportation, providing infrastructure to the poor, providing efficient electricity, helping developing black farmers and developing the entire country, which the criminals stole and put in their pockets.
President Ramaphosa said that the public should not think that the ANC is a means of gaining power, or wealth and fighting to the ends.

Nigeria is facing the worst economic recession this year.
Published date: 24/08/2020 - 16:33.
The Nigerian Statistical Agency announced that the country's economy has experienced an unprecedented recession in the last 10 years, as a result of a recession that exceeded the 6% observed between April and June of this year.
The Commission's figures today show that between April and June, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of daily operations, Nigeria's economy entered an unprecedented period from 2010 to 2020.
The agency listed the causes of the problem including forcing people to stay indoors across the country, restricting traffic, restricting air travel and closing schools and businesses.
The agency added that taking such measures internationally has led to a sharp drop in oil prices, while factories internationally have been closed to address the problem.
Last May, Nigerian Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said the Statistical Commission had predicted a similar situation, as a result of these problems hampering the day-to-day running of the country, forcing the government to select its budget.

Akpabio has broken an egg on the contract of the Nigerian parliamentarians.
Minister for Development of Niger Delta Region in Nigeria, Godswill Akpabio revealed the names of the members of the council that the NDDC Commission has awarded contracts for the management of some major projects.
This comes at a time when the heads of the Niger Delta Regional Development Commission NDDC are accused of embezzling funds.
Among the names of the members of the Congress who received the contract included the chairman of the Senate Committee on Niger Delta, Peter Nwabaoshi who received a list of 53 contracts as announced by Minister Akpabio.
Mr. Akpabio also said that Senator Mathew Urhoghide won six contracts, then Senator James Manager also won six contracts, while former Senator Samuel Anyanwu won 19.
As well as former chairman of the NDDC's Board of Trustees, Nicholas Mutu, has approved 74 contracts, the highest number as stated by Akpabio in several documents he sent to the committee investigating allegations of conspiracy in the Niger Delta Development Authority.
A small number of MPs from Ondo and Edo also received contracts from the NDDC.
The documents released by Akpabio show that most of the contracts were awarded in 2018, but the amount of money spent on their execution is not disclosed.
This comes after the Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila threatened Akpabio in court on charges of trying to defame members of the House.

The UN advised Buhari to use politics to address the security crisis.
The UN urged Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari to use dialogue and political means to address the security challenges that plague the country.
The High Commissioner to Nigeria Edward Kallon made this clear when he led a team to the presidential palace, saying that the security problems that plague the country with its various branches are difficult to solve.
Kallon said that as the soldiers there compete, it is vital to support them in negotiating and using political means for peace.
The official described three issues that plague Nigeria including the issue of citizenship and ownership of land and the crisis of governance.
Kallon said the Congress spends at least $1.5 billion annually on charitable causes in Nigeria, especially in the region hit by the Boko Haram crisis.
The official praised President Buhari for his role in combating corruption and embezzlement as well as reforming government services, urging the president to expand rural participation in the campaign.

Sen. Ali Ndume, a member of the Nigerian Senate representing South Borno, said Boko Haram fighters killed an elder in Gwoza Local Government Area 75 in one night.
The councillor added that besides the elderly who died in the past months during the height of the attacks in parts of Borno state, Boko Haram militants also massacred several young people in the Gwoza area, by making them line up, where they also kept shooting one by one.
Speaking at a meeting of stakeholders organised by Parliament on the crisis, Senator Ndume recently said that up to this point his Gwoza region was facing a security crisis that he could not reach.
The council member, who praised the military for their strength, said the Boko Haram crisis was still ongoing, seeing how they continue to kill people in his state.

Yobe Spent Over N78.8m Off Revival and Leda - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Yobe state government's efforts, under Governor Malala Buni to revive the state-owned Yobe state-owned Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company, after more than 10 years in a disused hold.
This was stated by the company's General Manager, Engineer Shaaibu Adama Gadaka, in a conversation with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, earlier in the week.
He said the company had been closed for more than 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was difficult to resolve the intention of reviving it, who immediately ordered the removal of 78.8 million naira to repair the company's critical components with an additional 48 million naira to manage it, while allowing the company to walk on its feet.
Eng. Gadaka added that this gave them the opportunity to buy the necessary products to start the company, which included the newest 500 KbA power generator, 500 KbA power distribution machine, new bottle leather sprayer, bottle washer and other tools needed by the company.
He then said, "To this day, the main objective of this initiative of Governor Buni, in reviving this company is to provide jobs to young people, while reducing unemployment and providing income to the state of Yobe".
According to Gadaka.
On the other hand, he said the company has gained favour with the state's farmers, thanks to the state's revival of the Potiskum-based Yobe Flour and Feed Mill and other traders who sell the company's products.
He said the profits and efforts of the state government to reform the fertilizer company are also a basis for the purchase of the materials that the company manages.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges we face, based on the fact that the company has been locked for over 10 years, as the machines start working but we need to switch to other products to be able to operate without any fear".
We expect that before our work is complete, we will try to bring in the rest of the supplies we need.
Additionally, Gadaka said, "On the one hand, we are asking the Yobe government to provide us with more equipment, trucks and vehicles to facilitate our operations, especially for transporting our employees to the office to avoid being late, when we start working too late".
He also said that at present the company has sent 25 young people to get training on how to operate machines and machines and how to manage the products used by the company in its projects and how to deal with the business and the people they interact with.
He also said that the company has now started producing various coloured plastic bags, which include 100kg, 50kg and 25kg sizes with the provision of layers to the marketers based on the colour and type of the bags they want, the company is ready to satisfy them.
