Welsh MPs are concerned about what they look like.
Some MPs don't understand why their MP status should change to MP status in Wales.
The MPs were outraged by the plans to change the name of the local assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all political parties believe this is a deal.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it was being rhymed with the words "stupid" and "unreasonable".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb, and pwp means dumb.
The MP said her group was completely unhappy and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a marionette.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly's commission, which is now drafting a bill to amend the name, has made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the assembly deputies call will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that found broad support for calling the meeting the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of additional MP, the Commission preferred the Member of Parliament for Wales or the MP, but the MP option received the most support during public consultations.
Additional MPs are obviously offering alternative options, but the path to consensus could be a headache for Speaker Ellen Jones, who is expected to present the bill within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the Assembly's work, such as rules on disqualifying additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committee system.
Additional MPs will vote on what they should be called when they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters vote to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia or against it.
A national vote was held to resolve a longstanding issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, which has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Community and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The Macedonian president, Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, said he would not participate in the vote.
But the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that changing the name  is just the price to pay for joining the European Community and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing, the churches of Harlem are fighting for their existence
"Previously, as the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there's no one here.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
People have different relationships and relationships today, he said.
Barries are no longer cozy local living rooms where people go all the time.
As for churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who would not help the temple that would remain in the area.
"The vast majority of the residents who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up the day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that the majority of people who move into these condos will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by a white community before Harlem became a black neighborhood  the Church of the Catholic Community in 1870, the Church of St. Martin  a decade later.
The original white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black community praying nearby got ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by a black community led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on the main shopping street at 125 Harlem Street, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but under the guidance of Father Johnson, the faithful planned a reconstruction: they put the cranes into operation.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the crib the crib of the poor.
An expert who played curling in July called it something else: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first carillon played by the black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin's Church had not replaced him.
What happened at St. Martin's Church in the past few months was a complex story between architects and traitors, some of whom were drawn by false church leaders, others by the diocese.
The congregation of believers  the governing body of the congregation, which consists of the assistants of the chaplain,  wrote to the diocese in July with the warning that the diocese would try to transfer the expenses to the congregation of believers, although the congregation did not participate in hiring architects and sub-contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near the Bacon Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning he was scuba diving with friends for half an hour when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then swam with the rest to help pull him out of the water.
At first Hamel thought it was just a wake-up call from lobster catching, but then he realized something bad had happened: I was bitten!
I was bitten!
His whole key was torn, said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he came to the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: 'In the water near the shark!'   added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to the Reedy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victim suffered a trauma to the upper torso.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Punta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty products departments in a global marketplace where trained professionals will work.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market with a turnover of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while sales of fashion clothing and home goods are falling, larger beauty houses will be presented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year, which will demonstrate success.
The beauty investments come because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were once occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and homewares.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its beauty product offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will be appearing for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the firm's departments, similar to what you can find in stores like Boots.
Big-box stores are also rebooting their boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be vegan, and this trend is becoming increasingly in demand among young buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of products daily in local stores near home lead to supermarkets having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the retail outlets will be more like a wholesale market as the supermarket chain tries to compete with Aldi, Lidl and other discount retailers with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has located Argos's stores in hundreds of stores, and has also located several Habitats stores since it acquired both stores two years ago, which he said has helped grow sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to rebuild their beauty and pharmacy departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury's was a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to split the pharmacy revenue ended after a series of sweatshops in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with its 281 store Celesio to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £125 million.
It was reported that Lloyds had played its part in this by expanding its range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We've also invested in training our employees to be able to make recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive setting and convenient location make us the best beauty home that can stand up to the old-fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones was furious when Holly Willowby refused the £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became infuriated after TV presenter Holly Willowby refused an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willowby there is no time for branded goods for home and accessories Truly.
The business couple became similar to the brand of the Goop's Guiness Peltra.
This morning, the 37-year-old hostess announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with his lucrative clothing-branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was furious when a golden girl from television confessed during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal worth up to £1.5 million meant she would no longer have enough time to deal with Truly's home goods and accessories.
The business was similar to the brand of Gwyneth Peltrow Goop and was doubled to double Willowby's wealth to 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her holiday homes.
The source reported: Truly was Holly's top priority.
It was her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon had to start the lunch.
At Marlow's headquarters there is a warehouse full of goods ready to sell.
Experts estimate that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain's most important stars, could cost companies millions because of huge investments in goods ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and because of possible delays in their implementation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
The couple is on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the television company Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the brand representative for M&S and will replace Aunt McPartlin as the ITV hostess.
Last night, a source close to Jones reported, "We will not comment on his case".
A sincere conversation, after which we fell in love
He joked about the media's criticism of his comments, which they considered unpresidential because of the positive comments he made about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump denying so much?
Trump said in his parodying dictatorial voice.
I will not refuse anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks are deadlocked.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Lee Yan-ho told a world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not wait for the appropriate US measures in response to North Korea's earlier disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're building very successful relations with North Korea", he said.
It could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a good relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: completing missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of the American military home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be on the side of the president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to break into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboca has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a little difficult", Ms. Sombung said.
While Save the Children is also assembling a team to travel to Paulo, it is unclear whether foreign workers can work on the premises.
Mr. Sotopa, a spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that are constant in Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the unexpected in nature.
Although shelters were built in Acheche, there are hardly any in other coastal towns.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of the Paul tsunami led to more casualties, although the warning was.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And the disaster made the logistics of the move difficult.
A hospital ship that was located on the Lombok coast to treat earthquake victims is approaching Paul, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo focused his campaign on improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure and spending money on highways and railways.
But the lack of funding is haunting Jock's administration, as there are new elections next year.
Mr. Joca is also facing pressure from ongoing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members are embracing more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Olding of Liverpool pushes the ball away against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League by drawing a tie in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received the transfer from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 metres from the lock of Chelsea's 1-0 lead.
He made a finch with the ball to the left of himself before making a shot into a long stick.
The attempt ended in a high-scoring under the top of the pole when the ball flew into the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over Cape Arisbalaga's head, which jumped straight into the net.
"He was just trying to get into this position to push the ball, and players like Shaq were always trying to push as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible", said Old in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kanté ran, made a light pass, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead early in the second half after being knocked out by the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Attacking the Reds in this match made a pass to Matthew Kovacic, before returning to the half-defense zone and running into half the field at Liverpool.
The crane quickly found itself in the center of the field.
Then he made an impressive blow, passing the ball to Azar at the gate.
Azar ran around the defender and punctured the bottom left corner of the back of the Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Baker's pole.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stade de São Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet the European Champions League's UEFA Videotape at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Agency for Disaster Management said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, the representative of the agency Sotopa Purvo Nugroha said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of the 7.5 point earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Paulo, home to more than 380,000 people, was swept away by the ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was cut.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with stab wounds in the Grayson Mouse area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area to contact them if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to speak to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious and ask them to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, videographers who may have made some kind of video, to contact us, as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
This afternoon, a friend of the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they were in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muz had just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will be a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The policeman explained to one person that the entire area was now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, "It's so awful".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the multi-story building.
Anyone with information should contact the @MerPolCC police department, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling the record 247 dated September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell was the last monumental blow in the history of the rewrite.
Its removal would be poetic justice for its similar destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as stupid and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the demolition of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument to Oliver Cromwell at the Palace of Westminster would become the subject of these actions.
The iconography of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
William Ham Thornycroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and a part of the historiography of the actor, who many believe still needs to be honored.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been known by many since the late 19th century better than he is today as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a fairly accurate representation is the subject of a long historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is the individually recognizable figure who represents one of the parties to this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and honoured.
A pig-killer has slaughtered a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man known only by the surname  Yuan was found dead with a ruptured artery and blood in his body near a market in Lupanchu, Guizhou province, the South China Post reported on Sunday.
A pig owner was preparing to get a vaccine from a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Sinin, China's Qinghai province.
He reportedly came with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a large fountain of blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic medical examination confirmed that a 550-pound spray killed the farmer.
My cousin's legs were bleeding and damaged,  said a cousin named Wu (according to a Guiyang Evening News quote).
Video from the surveillance camera showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
While the cases of pigs attacking humans are rare, they have been before.
So in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to get seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife let the animal go.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act like a slurry.
They're just creepy.
They're spineless and very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect, he said.
The remnants of the hurricane Rose will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, the Rose will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The speed of the Category 1 hurricane, Roz, was 85 mph at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 miles southwest of Punta Euchenia in Mexico.
Rosario is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and when the Red Storm approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosario will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, which interacts with the coming low-pressure area, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Places with 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous flash floods, mudflows and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach anywhere from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially much of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to the disaggregated areas of tropical rainfall, a sudden flood is possible if conditions quickly deteriorate.
It would be highly unwelcome to walk out into the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into stormy rivers, and rain will be accompanied by gusty winds and dust.
The coming low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Possible over-a-half-inch rainfall can lead to a small amount of trash flow and slippery roads.
It will be the first rain in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before rain spreads throughout late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread throughout the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, the United States may see a sharp drop in temperature as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to sudden changes in temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of a sudden temperature change in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to increase and expand again.
Many central and eastern U.S. states are expected to experience warm October temperatures of 80 degrees Fahrenheit from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the auditions of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched the interesting witness performances Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Covan and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, and broadcasters cut off their regular programming in favor of an emergency news release Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: It consisted of a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull her out of her clothes at a high school party.
Cavanagh in his testimony said he was 100% sure it wasn't.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen on Friday, watched it.
The company counted on average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a lot of problems with evaluating people who watch TV in offices.
For comparison, the audience size is the same as in a play-off or an Oscar.
Fox News, whose experts strongly supported Cowan's appointment, ran all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers a day, Nielsen reported.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in the drama Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanagh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as protesters shouted at his address and as he tried to get on the elevator for a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was being laughed at, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
'I'm standing right here in front of you,' said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have authority over this", they said, "but many women are deprived of it".
Flake said his office had published a statement, and informed before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks for several hours carried live broadcasts when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on the nomination of Kavanagh to the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do it, only knowing that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority call for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Coons.
After talking to Koons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics because of Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In one interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, opposed her so-called "borderline" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal for a single tariff between the UK and the European Union was "absolutely absurd".
Wade Simpson murder: Police arrested the suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, police said in a statement.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between the Sims and the Simpsons, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to the fatal shooting at Wade.
The betting price is set at $350,000,  reports Advocate.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Investigative Service published a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department are asking residents of the neighborhood for help with an investigation that could lead to an arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University, Joe Alleeva, thanked the district's law enforcement for their dedication and commitment to justice.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
He averaged 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, coach Will Wade of the University of Louisiana basketball team said the team was devastated and shocked by Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash to Mexico
The ashes from the Papakatépetel volcano have reached the southern areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday recommended that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
There was a roar and a thrust in the center.
Social media images showed that in neighborhoods like Sacamilica in Mexico City, there are thin layers of ash on the windshield of a car.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, following a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goi, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence activists clashed with the police, and thousands more joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarization vote for Catalonia's separation.
A group of masked separatists, who were being held back by the police, threw their eggs and flourished with powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Later that day, the fighting broke out when police used their dubs to deter protesters.
For several hours, a group of independence fighters who chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" encountered the union activists who were shouting "Living Spain".
According to local media reports, 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the region, which is striving for independence, remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists noted.
The overwhelming majority of voters favored independence, although the turnout was low, largely due to a boycott.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region as a result of angry protesters.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Thérèse, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best times we've had.
I saw my parents cry out of joy when they could vote, but now we were tired, he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties tried their best to keep pace this year with many of their most prominent leaders and ended up either in voluntary exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Jean Pouch, who is recording a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Ariol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZO since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament election next year.
To be elected as a candidate for the European elections  is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
Men arrested after they ransacked a house in a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred in the Belinogard-Cresent area on Thursday at about 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
Maybe at some point a bullet was fired into the car.
As a result of the Mango's hit, Livingston wins over Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Mango's first goal for Livingston secured them a win
Livingston's success had stunned Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerrard as manager of Ibrox after his several defeats in 18 games.
The Mango Valley hit was a great one, as Gary Holt rose to the same level as the Hibernates in the second division.
Gerrard's team will not win this season's premiership and will meet the leaders next Sunday, the Harts team, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Ranger's of the Europa League accepted the Viennese Rapid on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended its unbeaten streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt is still feeling a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance because of the rude visitors
Holt's team was supposed to be on the lookout long before they killed, but that direction caused Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his shot at the gate, after which Alan Lithows was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's blow.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb guests at any time.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
With the Rangers' penalty kick being allowed, and Livingston's reworking of his debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to beat Meng, who made a pass and hit from the middle of the field.
By this point, the Rangers were dominant, but it turned out the team's defense was unsuitable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually uninvolved.
The same thing continued in the second half, although Alfredo Marellas actually saved Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was hit by Rangers goaltender Alan McGregor, and Lithgow was far from the second set of Livingston.
The balls were constantly hitting the gate of Livingston and were knocked down, while the two penalty demands, after being called upon by Halket to replace Glen Middleton, and the penalty demand for playing the hand, were rejected.
Fenomen from Livingstan  analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alce Deir Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the higher echelon, but one must give a proper account to Holt for how he has stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halcott was a formidable, building a well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the field.
Ranger's was not inspired.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they didn't meet that standard.
In the last game, they didn't have the ball, only scoring once in the gate, which was kind of an alarming call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there was a smile and a sense of unfounded drowsiness as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore NATO-allied relations.
They argued over human rights issues, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan was on his way to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security measures to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to welcome him into the country.
Protests for and against the event reflected disagreements over a guest who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and condemned as an autocrat by others.
Motorcycle accident in Deptford: Motorcycle rider killed in collision with car
The cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, the medical staff arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said their staff is working to identify the man and report him to his closest relatives.
There are roadblocks and bus stops nearby, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six employees injured during the riots
Six prison officials were injured in riots in a strictly male prison, the Penitentiary Department reports.
Riots broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcester around 09:30 on Sunday and continue to this day.
To combat the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, a special group of Tornadoes was involved.
The staff were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "A specially trained prison staff was sent to fight those who had committed riots in the prison of Long Lartin".
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be turned over to the police and can spend more time behind bars.
The Royal Lortin Prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was undergoing treatment in the hospital after a prisoner was attacked.
And last October, law enforcement officers were called to the prison to deal with the serious riots in which they were attacked with water polo bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with heavy flooding (which may be beneficial for arid regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week because there are traces of the hurricane Rose in the southwestern part of the desert that pose a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service on Monday and Tuesday published data on flash floods in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that on Tuesday, Rosas will go straight through Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or pressure drops within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border in 1967.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual levels reaching as high as 6 inches in the Magellonian area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, the drop is likely to be between 1 and 2 inches, with individual resulting values reaching up to 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be a long-awaited one, as their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfall is likely to be beneficial because there are droughts in the southwest right now.
According to the U.S. Agency for Drought Monitoring, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a second-category extreme drought, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the late afternoon in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, the storm still had a maximum winds of 85 mph (385 miles) south of Ponte Eugenia in Mexico, and was moving north at 12 mph.
The storm will hit colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore calm down.
So, when a tropical storm hits Mexico, rivers are expected to flow out of the shore in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall in various parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
A total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Lower California to the northwestern Sunnyside, where rainfall is possible to 10 inches, reports weather.com.
Then, the Red Storm will move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
The main threat is expected from the Rose or its remnants, which are very heavy rains in Lower California and the northwestern Sonoran Desert and the southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and mudflows and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: four attempted arrests of killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old body was found with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton around 4pm on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy and two others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
The police approached anyone who could have any evidence on their cell phones of what happened to continue their search.
"Cavanaugh is shaking from the naiveté and anger of the Democratic Party", Trump said.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to abolish the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump announced at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was suffering from the naiveté and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying accusations by Christine Blessy Ford that he sexually abused her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her accusations.
On Saturday, the President said that on this day, Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliant, qualitative and courageous character.
"The voice in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished history of public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination, talking about the importance of Republicans appearing in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late, he said.
That's why I'm always fighting for great candidates.
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to oppose and disrupt.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the parliamentary leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of victims is rising.
At least 384 people died and many people were missing as a result of a wave of giant beach waves when a major earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paulo on Friday, when waves of six metres (18 feet) were hitting the shore at dusk, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake followed by tsunamis.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they became victims", said a briefing in Jakarta by the press secretary of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Soto Purvo Nugroho.
"The tsunami pulled cars, bears, houses, hitting everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
He said that some people survived only by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24th Paulo Centre.
Aerial photos published by the Styrian Disaster Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges spinning and collapsing, and the mosque surrounded by water.
The next push continued to take over the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
The Nuggroha called the damage "extensive" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without report.
"The damage and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Polo, an area called Dongla, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake", said Nugroho.
The communication in Dongla was completely damaged, Negro said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
'It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,' he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the Paulo tsunami, but officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage posted on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting at people on the street about the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water fell to the shore, dragging behind buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that disrupted communications around the pole, so the authorities found it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military began to steer cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed much needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was only open for aid and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the evacuation centers in Paulo.
The tsunami in Indonesia killed more than 800 people.
That's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Danggala were successfully reaching the city of Paulo, where workers were hiding in the briquette sheds set up in their office yard, they saw scenes of devastation along the way", said Mr. Doseba.
I was told that he had seen many ruined houses.
That's very bad.
Even when aid groups started their grim efforts to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were prevented from traveling to the Polo.
According to Indonesian law, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level", said Auliya Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster", we can open up to international aid, but that status is not yet there.
On the second night in Paulo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing without news hoped that their close friends, by magic, would be among those who would leave the unfortunate storylines of the static disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days and had her baby's body near her.
Gendon Subandon, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, prepared two of the missing paragliding plans for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his disciples.
"Being a senior in paraplanetary science, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's destruction spreading among the paraplanetary community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one grey bell instead of two blue ones.
This means that messages were not delivered, he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during a refill at Newport on Levi's
"On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who had deposited banknotes at a bank in Newport, Lifetime", the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
"The driver of the car had thrown a cash machine into the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a release.
While he was busy, another man ran away from the Brinko worker and stole a fur with money destined for delivery.
Witnesses reportedly spotted several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with personal information should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changes his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kenny West".
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious meaning to him.
I believe ye  is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it's ty", West said earlier this year, discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So I  this is you, I  this is us, all this is us
It went from "Keeney", which means "One", to just "Ye" reflecting our good, our bad, our rottenness, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, Jay-Z, also ran out of links and headlines.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against the peaceful inhabitants
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Abrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student repression.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Abrador promised never to use military personnel to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot down a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, while left-wing student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study, thereby opening up more free places in public universities.
"Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting youth to criminal gangs", he said.
The U.S. should double funding for machine intelligence.
"As China becomes more active in machine intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field", says investor and machine intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about MI, even though the US lacks an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled a plan to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget in the field of AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States, and we're looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big achievement of AI will happen in the United States,  Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superstate Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American player, Atel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese office in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, and asked if there would be a next one to help define the next window.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants", Lee said.
It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lamps to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in machine intelligence (MII).
"I think the green cards should be automatically offered to the candidate in the field of MIM", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released a plan for the development of next-generation machine intelligence.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, which involves industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Security Commission for Machine Intelligence, had not been monitoring the action for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed NATO and the European Union.
In June, both governments signed a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic population.
President George W. Bush has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will match the minimum 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question of voting in the referendum proposes: You are for NATO membership and the EC with the agreement with Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a fee to be paid for admission to bodies such as the European Commission and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said 79, Oliver Georgievskaya, Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will consider the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name will require more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no reports of violations had been received by 1 a.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent at the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Scopean voter Jose Tanewski.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica and his son Duska voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kovardakov, 54, prepared a small scene and laid chairs in front of tents installed by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with the heads up, not through official doors", Quadradkarov said.
We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
I think the majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Commission and NATO, Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll by the Macedonian Broadcasting Corporation showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they voted yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum failure will be the first serious blow to the policy of a pro-Western government since his arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes to the gate through the whole defence of Brighton
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling solved the problem of defence against Brighton by defeating Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero did it with ease.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton before hitting the open field.
Then Aguero found himself among the four green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the Brythonic field.
Then he pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker with the first touch in the penalty gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right-handed hit to bypass goalie Matthew Ryan with a hit in the right side of the net.
Aguero has some leg problems, city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored the goal at the same moment.
But it was Searing who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
The Aguero won this ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Seine made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far pole.
Attacking Sky Blues, he threw the ball into the net before he jumped overboard.

Shorter wants to play the point guard against Rocky.
After the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to forge a new start.
But the consistently competitive Sherman hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff consequences for the Rockies, who remain in the lead after one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still hoping to win their first division title.
Even though we're playing just like this, at least we can handle it, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will be so that the game will probably be the highest level of all I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a Sunday start, but they are reportedly willing to give the ball to the Cherryb in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, had a session at the CPS on Thursday and will be on a regular vacation on Sunday.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of Republicans appearing in midterm elections.
Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones. I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm everywhere fighting for big candidates.
Trump went on: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back their power, using whatever means necessary, you see,  naughtiness, mischief.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them.
He said the Democrats intend to oppose and disrupt.
"And you see, these last four days", he said, "the demons are vicious, evil, contrary, and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for the previous recognition of Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, who received a strong rating from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document leak?
Uh, that.
No, I don't expect  it was a very bad nonverbal language  the worst language I've ever seen.
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's intolerance towards those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of the Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome to express our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar reaction because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censors for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, are things that Jeremy didn't agree with his predecessors on.
The report on the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham East Labour Party, says that we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local MP from the Labour Party it was such a meeting that was on Friday
Unfortunately, today most meetings are not in that tone and promise a more good, more soft policy long forgotten if ever it was.
It's becoming increasingly clear that in the Labour Party, different views are not allowed, and each opinion is assessed from a point of view, whether it's acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues I once thought shared my political views with began to expect me to take a step back and took positions I would not agree with on national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I speak publicly, and it doesn't matter what I say, there's a ton of outrage on social media calling for an election to be cancelled, condemning the politics of the centre, saying I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
And I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racial abuse every day, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a different-minded organization, and with every movement of confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party gets closer.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice that urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then I'd be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, fueled by Thatcher government neglect, which literally ruined my education, I've been advocating for better public services for those who need them most -- whether it's a local resident or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could interfere with my political positions and areas of disagreement with my current leadership.
For those of you who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is heading for a Brexit that is damaging to our households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the only message I actually have,  it's not Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of election cancellation and political expediency that will prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ir-Melrose 38-17: Irreconcilable Ir at the top
Two later attempts may have somewhat ruined the final result, but, without a doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting Premier League match of the Tenants.
Now they lead the tournament table, the only side out of 10.
After all, it was their highest defense, just as their best chance had made them their masters, coach Peter Mortimer had the full right to be satisfied.
We've still tried our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give the right to Aero, he dared more than we do".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Fraser Clim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealized attempt.
Climov extended the lead of the Air with a penalty before, right in the break, he shot and then made a solo attempt, making the Air 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Bogot, cut the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to the Ruarid Knott, which was stretched, and after the re-launch the Air advanced further through a Stafford McDowell attempt, implemented by Climate.
Air, performing the duties of Captain Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February's pressure.
However, the hosts came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for knocking Climes out without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson landed behind the Air.
Climax made his attempt, which he did again almost after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong into the penalty box and sent the flanker Gregory Henry on the fifth attempt of the field masters.
The Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the game star Ford Kieran is going to enter the hotel industry after it turns out that he was appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes and films with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next series would be the last in the series, and it appears that Kern is planning to move on after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kernan hoped to take part in the booming Glasgow trade.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "Our Sea" is painted on the right.
To recover is our duty.
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost by Chile in the bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive  as well as the desire to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached their peak in recent decades as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of debate.
Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive outcome,  said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadalia.
Many Bolivians will watch the MS's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that a tribunal in The Hague after decades of tense negotiations will support Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Eva Morales is the charismatic president of Bolivia who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that will change little even if it does.
The Netherlands-based United Nations has no decision-making authority on Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's ruling comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered indicates that the case was not complicated, said the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have thrown it back.
The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration, said Sarat.
According to her, Morales's militant rhetoric had destroyed the remaining Chilean charity.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that, it will be very difficult to have a discussion.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velt, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement to mutual benefit, he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales  was still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America  used the maritime problem as a political support.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision  is the opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says it won't get nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at the leaders' summit in Singapore.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restoring a nuclear stall with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Lee says it's a desperate dream that the continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the Korean War-ending declaration will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are demanding a second summit.
But there is a lot of skepticism about whether Pyongyang takes seriously the denial of its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show we saw the newest line of massive headscarves on the way to the shops in your cities
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely close the sun, you can look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium a number of unusual headwear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, unprofessional hats were popular on Instagram, and designers sent their creations to the podium.
A hallmark of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, decorated with broad feather-like fields that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included precious stones decorated with coconut, a witch's hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
And then Brown showed him a bunch of clever masks right before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with sewn lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a swimming pool with a tube and protective glasses, and the other resembled a molten cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to stick to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who follow style predict that huge hats can penetrate our daily lives.
The huge hats go up in heels to La Bomba, a straw hat with fields two feet wide that can be seen by everyone from Ryan to Emily Ratoikovsky.
A cult label on a very uncomfortable hat that was dissolved in social media, contributed to another big creation on the podium  a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag dressed in a bathtub.
A dark orange rugged bag, decorated with a rugged rugged skirt and covered with a white leather pen, became a prominent part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has had a huge impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
Knowing languages is a must for all citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain their academic achievements, and this has continued since 2018 with another excellent test result, backed by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide a better working environment for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement individual school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it stays in their head.
When you talk to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
And from the results of the most recent exams this year, we can see that languages are the top-ranked league in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got the highest A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher A-levels in Chinese learning, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved A-levels.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages are chosen as subjects just like STEM subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons employers cited for the difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were linked to a lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for future careers.
With more promising jobs that require language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter who chooses a profession, learning a new language will be a real advantage in the future if you have these skills for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person first among the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of  15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is so important to today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a choice of multiple languages with a faculty that is experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There's no denying that in today's global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of our country, and that this needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as new skills in international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference to the young people of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward  Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut Sunday in San Diego.
A start to the season for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes he'll play is still to be determined.
It's going to be more than one and less than 48,  Walton said on the Lakers' official website 
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James will likely play for a limited time.
According to a practice this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason games.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a series of stock options.
This is the first of five Trump speeches scheduled for next week, including stops at friendships in Tennessee and Mississippi.
When he confirmed the vote to come to the polls to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump sought to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's speech begin tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to hear a nomination hearing this week for Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh, who is having trouble with allegations of sexual harassment, with Senate confirmation expected within a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help the Republicans who are facing the November election.
So President Trump's campaign announced that the five speeches next week are designed to activate volunteer and supportive efforts as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign season", Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's event could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of Pittsburgh media, reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morris from West Virginia, who is the poll leader.
It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a boost in the polls,  said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reports.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA moves to the fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday's fourth day may have been just what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The pulse pendulum that moves is a perfectly invented sports concept that players sincerely believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the momentum now?
They had an advantage with six points, and now  four, so I think we're going through it with a little boost,  said Jordan Sleep, walking through the day.
Europe's lead, of course, is four points ahead, and there are twelve more to play.
Americans, Spitch says, feel that they've got a little bit of a wind, and they have a lot to look forward to, not least because of Spit and Justin Thomas's form, who've been playing together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Spite was mortal from T-shirt to green and is an example.
These cries of a party's whistle grew louder as his round went on, and he sank a decisive blow to play a match on the four court as they with Thomas retreated two by two.
His hit, which allowed them to win the 15th game, was met with a scream, like one that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out.
You just have to go deeper and worry about your own game, Spittie said.
Each of these players has already left.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players to score more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Mallinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Weird but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
The Mallows were the only couple that didn't make gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided gods on Saturday morning, Friday and Friday afternoon.
It happens, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this tumultuous crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential win in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Mallory.
I want both of them in different holes at the same time.
The talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the morning show hero, when he was dating Alex Noren.
The bogey and the two twins on the front nine dug out a Spanish and Swedish hole, from which they never got out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you with your moonlight.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between pairing, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has become the best team so far and has taken on a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also showed that the U.S. team is striving for a fight that some doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe is in the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Mallinari, the duo led the fight with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Björn's European side, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American Agency of Discontent this morning, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a four-ball game, winning two games, but they couldn't do much more.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk needs eight points from 12 singles on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and he and Mallinari, who was named Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four Ryder Cup games in history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they were perfectly consolidated to beat down Woods and American rookie Bryson DeComb with five and four more.
Woods, who held himself through two games on Saturday, showed a chance flash of brilliance, but now he's lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-ball and seven straight games.
Justin Rose, resting on the x-ball four, returned to partner Henry Stenson in the four-ball four before defeating Dustin Johnson 2 & 1 and Brooks Koepke  ranked second in the world.
Europe had no way of going, though it was a pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time top finishers Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set the American checkpoint by two points.
They won 2-1 over John Ram and Juan Pultor of Spain in a four-ball match and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarter, losing two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team come back from a four-point deficit, going single, although the owners of the Furyk need only draw to keep the trophy.
But after the next two days, which were better, the Sunday counterattack looks like they're gonna make it.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is continuing sanctions that increase distrust of the United States, and under such conditions the country cannot unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
Ri Yun Ho stated at the World Organization's annual General Assembly that last year North Korea took significant goodwill measures, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a proper response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way to first and foremost unilaterally disarm ourselves.
Although Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement proved significant in that he did not deny the unilateral declaration of denuclearization that Pyongyang had made in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been trying to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to lift the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States of America is first insisting on denuclearization and increasing pressure levels through sanctions to achieve its goals in a forcible manner, and even opposing the declaration of an end to war", Ri says.
The idea that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a dream come true for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions is deepening our distrust.
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president had noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were involved in this question of denuclearization, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be such a dead end".
However, Ri's tone was markedly different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly when he claimed that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea becomes denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump announced that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are fighting at the UN, and the Security Council has said that Pyongyang should be rewarded for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue actively and inevitably until we are sure of complete, final and genuine denuclearization.
The Security Council reinforced sanctions against North Korea in 2006 by trying to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the Security Council, and the General Assembly later announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea during several hours of negotiations ended with a visa statement that he was making demands similar to gangsters.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to eliminate the missile facility and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
Trump said that according to Kim, the appropriate measures he expects are a guarantee of security and a desire to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a class on proper rest.
This year's new Harvard class is supposed to teach students to sleep more, and it's designed to fight the culture of studying at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the world's best universities often don't know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I get this just now, in my final year of college?"
'She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep,' he told The Telegraph. 'It surprised me.'
For the first time this year, a student-led course explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement and improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief executive of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students often went without sleep for a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section shows a room in the dorm where students tap on cups of coffee, coffee tables and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and the importance of sleep habits.
At the advanced stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive images, urges participants to think about their daily lives.
We know that this will not change students' behavior instantly.
But we think they should know this as well as everyone knows about the health effects of smoking, Professor Chesler added.
He said the nightlife culture still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students is leading to sleep deprivation, which is a growing problem.
Provided enough good quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,  he said,  even to avoid being overweight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler design the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all aspiring students to complete a similar program before entering university.
Professor Chesler recommended that students set up a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from monitors and LED lights, which can alter the daily routine, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1:0 Ranger: Mengo scores the goal to Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Mengi's goal ensured that Steven Gerrard would not be defeated 1-0 at the Livingston Stadium.
Aybrokes are looking to record their first victory on their way to a 4-1 victory in February at St. John's, but Gary Holt's team is already beating Gerard's second defeat as manager with 18 games to leave eight points behind Premier League leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Mengo hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, inspired by the goal, didn't look like they were losing.
While Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, and Hibernia are behind by a margin of balls.
For the Rangers, additional problems may arise after forward Columns Spence has to recover from a head injury after he gets a thrown object from the tribune.
Gerard made eight changes, which caused him to miss the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under number 11, which allowed him to pick up the point from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they had been dealing with their opponents at every step.
The Rangers had more of the ball, but Livingston made more of the shot.
They were to kill as early as two minutes later when the first time Minge had directed the ball through Scott Pittman to the gates of Alan McGregor, and then the halfback took that chance.
Jacob Keegan's successful penalty kick delayed Craig Halkett's shot, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to deliver a strong kick from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hopeful of hitting than they were of a good game.
Alfredo Marellas was certainly to be fined a quarter of an hour before he and Stephen Lawless met on the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not accept Columbia's complaint.
The Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but former Aibrocks goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely gave up the goal to Lassan Kuliballi and an effective attack to Owie Eckharia.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute, Levi may have been against a further active game, but no one denies that they had to show the fans a good game.
Once again, the Rangers failed to break through Jacob's gate.
Scott Orfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who had blocked Meng from getting a shot at the gate.
Gerard replaced Coolidge with Ryan Kent in the break, and it worked when the attacker broke into Marelos, but the impressive Kelly ran away and blocked the strike.
But Livingston continued to delight the visitors by playing the game they liked, and Lithgow and Halket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
The Holt side was only able to prevail at the last minute, but McGregor played well to oppose Jacobs before the Lithgow went to the bench of spare.
Ranger Glenn Middleton was replaced by another penalty shooter when he ran into Jacobs, but Thompson managed to get away.
Alman: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
Page from our almanac: Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and today is the day of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's calculator became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Call of the Coronation", which featured the seemingly little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms being radiated by minerals".
Evans: Tell me, is this really annoying right now?
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system see cancer cells.
The new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system detect and destroy bad cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which is part of the treatment.
The method involves getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then the cells can see the protein that is common in many cancer cells and then re-introduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine has shown successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells found that ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method involves getting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab so they can see the HER2 protein common to many cancer cells, and then re-inserting them.
This is what Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said, and our results suggest that there is a very promising vaccine.
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-tumor cells that fight cancer of the mammary gland, ovaries, lungs and colon,  explained Professor Berezovsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and training them to reach cancer cells worked well in treating leukemia.
Kanye West has joined the debate in support of Trump, wearing the I.A.O. title, after his appearance in the N.C.L.
Which didn't turn out well.
In the studio on Saturday night, Kanye West was reprimanded after a speech in which he praised the United States, and President Donald Trump announced that he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song, "City of the Wind", in the evening, when he was in the hat, "Make America Great Again", he stood up to the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
How many times have I spoken to white people and they said, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
The SNL began the show starring Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star was teasing Bret Cavanaugh's performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearing of the sexual assault case of Christina Tracy Ford.
Although the speech was not broadcast, West's words were captured and uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to take the West.
Besides, West complained to the public that he was having a tough time behind the scenes.
They were teasing me behind the scenes.
"Don't go out there with that hat", they said.
They were bullying me.
'And then they say I'm in a dead end,' he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the place where the hell he's going to put my Sperman hat on, which means he can't tell me what to do?
Try to love.
His statements led to at least two hearings being called off, and the NSC officials were confused by the message from the Verii.
West was hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA party, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the most courageous people in the world, thank you for your support".
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote that West is who he is, and that's always great.
But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art, which I believe covers and twists an ideology that is damaging to my community.
He is free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his name would now officially be Kenny West.
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, and he followed in the footsteps of Dizzy, also known as Puff Dizzy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion and, of course, a music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then again he and the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a second man was attacked in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balikomor, police reported.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be handled by the state prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, the Whale Harrington, is gripped by idealized brutality.
Keith Harington is known for his swinging sword and role as John Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones in the medieval HBO series
But the 31-year-old actor has a stereotype of a hero's mother, which means that young boys often feel more ruthless about respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture section, Keith said he believed something had happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones neighbor, Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt empowered to solve this problem.
'I feel personally a strong guy,' when we were wrong with courage? 'he said.
Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?
Whale believes that television should be responsible for the brutality of the very male characters.
He went on to say, "What is the beginning and why is it taught?
Why teach on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time  how do we change this?
Because obviously something is happening to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that the series would end next summer, and he would be out of the series' battlefield and not making any sequels or docs to Game of Thrones.
From November, Keith will begin to reborn the True West Sam Shepard, who is the historical director with his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers meeting Rose's wife the best opportunity to complete Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character in whom the beloved whale character John Snow plays in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple announced their engagement in June 2018 at Leslie's mansion in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as they were in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China through blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has dropped to almost zero, Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem for LGBT communities in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still persists.
Because of conservative values, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted by inadequate knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the inflow of data, danger and conspiracy theory by her parliamentary staff
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the accusation that her colleague posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that there are claims to the far-right and their websites.
"Lies, lies, and a lot of loathsome lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly includes U.S. home addresses and phone numbers -- census -- Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Committee on Sexual Harassment hearings against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was leaked online on Thursday.
The escape came shortly after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to Waters' office and shared information with a Waters team member,  reports Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
A member of my team whose data, personal information, and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations was not responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
"This rejection is outrageous", wrote Fletcher.
That shows that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They don't have to be outrageous.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They should be calm and polite.
Fletcher compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too distraught during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarra, a Republican candidate who is running and participating in midterm elections, also tweeted.
It's a resonance, if it turns out to be true, he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found", she continued, "and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team members".
Johnny English Strikes Again is a blow to the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new British-influenced film, and that tendency seems to be in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny English, which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title "Johnny English's Revival".
Can the satire be a good way to express how obviously absurd we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English got the chance to laugh at things  his name was louder than all the comic creatures he had done for non-English viewers in cinema.
He is known to be a secret agent who, despite his clever claims to glamour, got a little bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's features and a little bit like the guy who made the one note in the Fire Chorus at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012.
His character was originally based on the traveler and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclayscar, leaving chaos on his way.
There are some pleasant moments that we haven't had before.
I liked Johnny English, who approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit a little bit on his helmet.
Atkinson's theatrical comedy talent is showing, but the humor is weak, and so it's surprising especially when serious films like 007: Missions Impossible are sure to offer comedy as a staple.
Humor is felt as if it's not just for adults, but for children, and even the silly Johnny English misadventures aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent films about Ben.
The longstanding topic is the UK's serious problems.
The cyber hacker infiltrated a super-secret British spy community in the UK, revealing the names of all the British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent on duty. This is unfortunately Kevin Eldon's small role.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed-up actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Theresa-May, but there's nothing like it in the script.
Her intelligence advisers say that since every real spy is exposed, she will have to involve someone who is already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, it's complicated: he's now working as a sixth grade teacher in several high-end institutions and teaching lessons on how to be an unclaimed operator: some good examples here, since English offers music academy espionage lessons.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his longtime friend Bo, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bo is married, tied to a submarine commander, whose role Vicky Pepperdine played a little in vain.
So Batman and Robin get horribly wrong at the Queen's Secret Agency, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Olga Kurilenka.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve the UK's hackers' problems: with the evil Jason Volt played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their action with immediate things: disguising themselves as officers, setting fire to a French restaurant, creating a fire, fighting smugglers aboard a luxury yacht called Volta, English commits pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
All the moments are drawn to the last event, but as pleasant and noisy as there is quite a lot of childish in the TV.
It's pretty good stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't think, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan to pay Britons for a four-day workweek with a salary of as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan where Britons work only four days a week but they get paid five.
The party reportedly wants the leaders of the enterprises to pass on the work done by the AI revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
It was obvious that employees were enjoying three days of work, but they were still getting the same paycheck.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and aims to direct the country to support workers.
The union convention approved the shift to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the economic changes.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not happening now, but a four-day workweek is an idea that fits the party's vision and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy in favor of the workers.
The Labour Party isn't the first to endorse this idea, and the Green Party promises to hold a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations are not supported at all.
A Labour Party official said, "A four-day workweek is not a party policy goal, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John MacDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he decided to turn power from the ruthless CEOs and managers to the public sector.
The shadow chancellor's plans also provide that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire stock package because the Labour government could make a "calculation" based on alleged violations.
He also confirmed that there were plans to bring workers to the boards of companies and to create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's own funds to employees who would hold annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for 60 minutes, that an FBI investigator who works with Cavanaugh must change his mind
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been postponed to a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the Republican Senate Bureau can support it.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minute correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about Sense: Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
I said, going to the courtroom, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked him why he was accused, asking, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
I think Brett Kavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett is firmly denying this", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
And they could not believe all that she said.
She's only 36.
I don't see anything new.
What is the International Citizens' Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival: an annual musical event that has a very impressive cast and crew and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will be held on the great plain of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concerts of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, and learn about the true purpose of the event -- ending poverty and the scourge by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against the Grain of an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket) the visitors had to perform a number of tasks, either "run a campaign", be a volunteer, email the country's leader, call any other activists, and raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civic Festival over the 12 years, and did it achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people that they need to take action, or is it just another instance of what's called "clichticism" where people feel they're doing a good job by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the festival's organizers have reported that they have recorded more than 19 million actions from their fans who are trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped push influential leaders to meet their commitments of over $37 billion, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group submitted 390 comments on commitments and applications worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnering with UK-based investors and executives, helping children develop in full, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help prevent the country from becoming undernourished after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens, we can eradicate the social injustice of undernourishment in history", said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 events called for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Nutrition Assistance Project, which reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, what makes you think we can end poverty?
The global festival said, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we're going to suffer defeat and failure".
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the few people to perform at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to block Russian oil and gas exports.
"Washington may, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East markets", US Secretary of State Ryan Zink said, reports the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, are a basis for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability to use the Navy to ensure that the sea routes are open, and if necessary, to arrange a blockade so that their energy is not going to the market", he said.
Zincke addressed the participants of an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less balanced and replacing fuel", he said, calling Russia a one-sided country with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the wrong North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a Moscow prison.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is rooted in economics and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans were hit in the head by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industry organization, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies", said Dietter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her role in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, says a senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
In a speech at the Town Hall in Haliocke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her involvement.
"It's time for women to head to Washington and put our ineffective government in order, and I'm talking about women in the highest positions", she said, according to "The Hill".
After November 6, I will be seriously considering running for president.
During a speech at the city hall, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying he was going to lead the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, we need the FBI to investigate before the vote".
However, the results of a poll published Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of the eligible voters in Massachusetts said a senator shouldn't run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed a stronger support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats who have been discussing the potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially make a decision by January.
At a conference supporting Donald Trump, Sarah Palin spoke of the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track and Field.
26-year-old Track Pauline spent a year in Iraq after being called up in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through after he returns, I can compare to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with in other families", she told a crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called this arrest a "real question" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, were being turned around by a little bit of others, hardened, returning with the question of whether there was the respect for which soldiers, pilots, other military personnel fought, giving themselves to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Oasis, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing an attempt to report domestic violence, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for Oasis Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new policy on providing harbor
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new U.S. policy of denying victims of gang or domestic violence in the harbor.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a report Friday in Washington to support the challenge to the airport policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was unveiled in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and his friends with the gang raped her, but the U.S. authorities denied her access to the airport on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers in the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which receive the most asylum requests in the United States, as the countries with the most serious gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. harbor policy changed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who were victims of domestic violence to seek refuge.
Attorney General Carl Reisin of the District of Columbia said Friday that the new policy ignores decades of legislative experience from states, countries and the world.
"Federal legislation requires that applications for asylum be based on specific facts and circumstances, and such a change violates this principle", the analytical note says.
The lawyers also said in the note that policies that deny immigrants are detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and create the jobs they need.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views,Sessions stated on June 11, announcing this policy.
Port has never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Paul's desperate rescue efforts, and the number of survivors, the number of deaths, doubled.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's very tense", says the 35-year-old mother of Riz Kusuma, while reassuring her young son with the temperature in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Paulo.
Every minute, the machine is bringing bodies.
Clean water is very little.
The residents began to return to their destroyed homes, picking up wet stuff, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-point earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Paulo Army Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street for repeatedly strong pushes.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered the feeling of strong underground pushes in a hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to escape.
I was squeezed under the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard the wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of using propaganda to threaten China
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in the American Daily, touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid add-on to the Des Moines Register's China Daily as the state's best-selling newspaper after accusing China of attempting to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the US election has prompted what US officials have called a Reuters conversation a new phase in Washington's campaign of pressure on China.
Although foreign governments' advertising is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have waged a trade war that has resulted in reciprocal import tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, said American and Chinese experts, were introduced to hurt exporters like Iowa businessmen who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Brinstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the top exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Bransdad wrote in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda in our free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of free speech and free press by printing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register, Brentsted wrote.
"And if you look at the newsstands in Beijing, you'll find not many votes against it and you won't see a real reflection of other opinions that Chinese people might have about the dangerous trajectory of the economy given the fact that the press is under the iron fist of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most influential newspapers declined the offer to print his article, although he did not name the paper.
Republicans are pushing women voters away from the midterm elections from the Kavanaugh Fiesta, analysts warn
While many prominent Republicans are defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh against multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned they will be hit back, especially by women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they're willing to vote.
"These things can't be returned", Grant Richar, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told the Hill Press for an article that was published Saturday.
Richard said he was not sure Senator Jeff Flake's statement about an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow and in November, said Corinne Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national press secretary for the progressive group MoveOn, a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate chamber when Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to run for the office of Kavanaugh despite a statement by Dr. Christina Blasie Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be tremendous", Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say they're tall, and it's true.
But there can be even higher, especially among suburban female voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don't like the president, but don't vote.
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there could be a big blow to the response.
"It's become a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It's not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's about how the Republicans handled it and how they approached it, according to Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided on the question of Ford or Kavanaugh's right, and he's a little more for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents may or may not have confidence in Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they may or may not have confidence in Kavanaugh.
And 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or might not have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is investigating allegations from Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had been trying to get her when he was 17 when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party when they were at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and who has permission to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant to offer the world.
"You have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The software uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online data repositories, or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, business lists, calendar, fanatics, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available at once on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage online is that only the user can determine who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement of potential with data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the ability to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, several developers working on the contract project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized software using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a complete change if all their business models were immediately revised.
We do not ask their permission.
In a Saturday issue of Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential advocate of net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: a priests' tribute to the victorian cross in the first world war
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the Medal on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Belenglis and LeCourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren unveiled a monument.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was very symbolic -- that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded it.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wang led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin through a thick embankment and under the strong gun and machine gun fire of the enemy.
Then he ran to the line of fire and with great courage led the soldiers forward, by himself seizing the gun and knocking out three divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little over a month later the war was over.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I could never do and something worthy of respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Wang also crowned the Council, led by the Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said it was a great honor for him to be part of the parade and added that the marriages of a real hero were demonstrated by the support that many people provide.
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they got a pig instead of a pepo
Imagine you're staying up all night to watch a packaged broadcast from Bellator 206 and then you're denied access to the main event.
There were 13 fights on the San Jose show, including six on the main map, and they were broadcast live all night on British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerard Mussey and Rory McDonald were preparing for a fight, the UK audience was just stunned when the show changed to Pep's Pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the tweets called switching to a children's cartoon a "someone's stupid joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said, "According to a state ordinance at 6 a.m., this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to a children's program".
Yes, "Pep's Pig".
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said they would be working on a program to take into account British viewers in the future.
"I think we're going to discuss the possibility of a repeat, I think we can solve this issue", said Cocker.
But now it's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we can't decide until Sunday, our time, and it's Monday, their time.
But we're doing our best.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem, thinking it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a government decision.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of hits from six to five, like we usually do, and this time we wanted to encourage the fans, but we're out of it.
It's a very extreme situation.
Tom Daley felt insignificant because of his sexuality
Olympic water-skier Tom Daley said he grew up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality  but it gave him motivation on the road to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that everyone was like me until he went to high school.
Speaking on the talk show "Disc of a deserted island" on Radio 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that when he had a child, he started thinking less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional host of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of her illness.
As the man who found himself on a deserted island on the first Laverne show, Daly said that as a child he felt less than anyone else because society didn't accept those who liked boys and girls.
He said, "I still think that this feeling that you are not anything like anything and that you are small has given me strength and inspiration to succeed.
He wanted to prove he was somebody, he said, so he wouldn't let anyone who knew about his sexuality down.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a significant activist for the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when I fell in love with a man -- an American screenwriter, director and producer, Dustin Lance Black, whom I met in 2013, -- it was unexpected for me.
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he says the age difference doesn't matter.
When you go through this at such a young age at the first Olympics he got there at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer he said it was hard to find a peer who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son was named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his prospects had changed completely.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you I need to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things in the world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robby  this is my Olympic gold medal.
His son, also named Robert, died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
Daly said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics  he wanted to sit in the front row.
'I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row, Dad,' he said.
'I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, did I finally realize that he was not immortal,' he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life, jumping in the water in front of my fans at the Olympics, that's the best feeling", he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song  Proud by Heather Small  which was a response to the Olympics and from which ants still run.

Mickelson, who is not in uniform, remains on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to get back in shape so that the event doesn't turn out to be unlucky.
Mickelson, who will play in this biennial competition, a record 12th time, team captain Jim Fury placed a spare bench for Saturday's football.
Instead of being in the center of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time Cup winner divided his days between charismatic work and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer isn't the perfect choice for a difficult Le Golf National field where punitive punishments are harsh.
And if the field itself isn't dark enough, Mickelson will be in the ninth game on Sunday against the eventual British Open champion Francesco Mallinari, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 singles, start with success, Mickelson's game could prove to be extremely important.
Fury expressed confidence in this player, but could say nothing more.
"He understood his role today, clapped me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furich.
He's very confident in himself.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot to the team last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I planned more, but it worked just the way we thought we would play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.
Mickelson broke Nick Fald's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been as successful as individual games.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence was beneficial to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to make fun of people and just a very nice guy who's good at having a team", he explained.
I think the younger players were pleased to pair his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
It gives the team much more than just a game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Byrne, knows that the big gap can quickly disappear.
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the final day of the Ryder Cup individual games can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 game in Walderm, where the European team under the leadership of Sevo Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that at Walder, we had a big lead and won, but with difficulty, we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost", Byrne said after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not the end yet.
Tomorrow we have to play all a hundred.
Get out on the field and do it right.
Until the points appear on the table, nothing is done.
We have a goal and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's what we're going to focus on.
I keep saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we know very well that on the opposite side are the best players in the world.
Pleased with the way his players played on a hard golf course, Byrne added: 'I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow, we're going to have individual games, and that's a whole different story.
It's just great when you're on the field with your partner and everything is going well, but when you're playing alone, that's where your real golfing skills come in.
That's what we have to bring to the players, that they have to show their best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave the partner, the pit has to go and also show your best as an individual player.
Unlike Björn, his rival Jim Fury hopes his athletes will play better individually than they did in partnership, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furic himself was on both sides of these final day matches, playing for the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a miracle at Medina.
'I remember every word of it,' he said, answering a question about how Ben Cranshor, captain of 1999, adjusted his players to the last day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we always want to have a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the speed increases, the greatest pressure is placed on those who play in the middle.
We've put together a schedule and put the players in the way we like, and you know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic.
Thomas is tasked with starting and playing against Rory McIlroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and John Paulter will play against top golfers.
"I've put my players in that order, because I think that's how I'm going to close everything", said Byrne about his choice for individual matches.
The landing of a new German warship was again postponed
A new German Navy frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to faulty systems and constantly rising costs, local media reported.
The downing of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the absolutely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military official.
The ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but problems that arose after construction have hampered this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships ordered as early as 2007 are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and some of the stalls' technologies, such as reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features  longer periods between maintenance  more new frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships that can allow Germany to demonstrate its strength outside the country will become obsolete by the time they finally enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the yard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have written about the numerous software and hardware flaws that make the ship useless in combat missions.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships had only 120 sailors  half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also found that the ship was very heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project  including training the crew  also becomes a problem.
The price has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) -- although it was initially 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are building up with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, said the Navy had fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions.
He said the problem is getting bigger over time, because old ships are being listed and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were capable of joining the Navy.
The National Monuments Society has been listening to the secret lives of bats.
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at finding out how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique mammals and help in future conservation efforts.
A study by scientists from the National Society for the Protection of Monuments in Scotland is dealing with small bats and also the long-eared bubbly Dabanton bats in the Inverry Gardens at Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in major locations in the area to monitor bats during the season.
Society staff and volunteers will conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all the sounds recorded will determine how often bats call, and what bats do.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob D'Ouer, a National Society for Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help us determine the benefits of creating habitats like meadows and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects and destroys their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a threat, as can fly tape and some building materials chemicals, and domestic cats.
The spoken are not blind at all.
However, because of their nocturnal life, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Society, which manages more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check-ups and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even created Scotland's first and only tick reserve at the Trieve estate in Dumfries and Galway, home to eight out of Scotland's ten tick species.
Property manager David Thompson says this is the perfect area for bats.
Here, in Trive, we have just a great place for bats, he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need for a better life.
He stresses the importance of checking for fleas before repairing property, as one can unintentionally destroy a single sedal by killing up to 400 samaks and young fleas, leading to the complete destruction of the local population.
The convicts are under guard and are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their sedals.
Elizabeth Feral, a staff member at the Scottish Bat Protection Agency, urges the public to help with this case.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our fleas, and we don't even know how many of their species live".
Ronald has denied the allegations of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape fake news, saying that people want to advertise themselves using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
The forward for the Portugal national team and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas studio in 2009.
And then he paid her $375,000 for her silence, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed 142 million subscribers within hours of the allegations being posted, calling the post "fake news".
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is fake news, said the five-time Golden Ball holder in front of the camera.
They want to advertise in my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy and kind man, he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable" to report suspicions in a private case, Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Sheart said the player will be seeking damages for moral damage in an amount that is comparable to the severity of the violation, and this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
The incident took place in June 2009 in the luxury hotel room of the Palms Hoytel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Having met at a nightclub, Ronald and Major returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as recorded in the Clark County District Court documents in Nevada.
Major claims that after that, Ronaldo bowed and said that at 99% he was good guy who suffers from 1%.
The documents say Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but with the consent of the parties.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took the damage pictures in the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement, as she was very afraid of revenge and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to reopen the case because she feels a moral trauma about the case.
At a time when this case was happening, Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of carmakers
Britain will always regret losing its status as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was disturbed by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at its plant in Burnston, near Derby, by half.
'We need a deal,' Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese automaker said the impact of a no-deal Brexit delay on the border could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Bernston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"I think that when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's CEO in Bernstone.
Other UK carmakers have raised the question of how they would conduct cross-border trade if Britain left the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that carmakers are talking about the risk of supply chains resulting from a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'exactly on time' principle, whereby spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for customized cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be border breaks that will lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota will be unable to keep spare parts at the Derby plant for more than a day, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark stated that Theresa May's Checker's Plan for the future of EU relations was designed to avoid such border checks.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will not only allow us to have the success of today, but also allow us to take advantage of that opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The information we get not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we need to be able to continue to operate successful supply chains.
Toyota was unable to say how long the plant would be shut down, but in the future it warned that the added cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and lead to job cuts.
Peter Cuvalluris, who has been a union coordinator for 24 years at Barnstone, said that union members are very concerned: "In my experience, if jobs are cut, they won't recover.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise plan for our future relationship with the EU that is trustworthy".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week while the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian election meddling, Trump's aides' ties to Russia, and potential presidential obstruction of justice.
To dismiss Trump as Assistant Attorney General or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, for months he poured oil into the fire of Washington gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was attended by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasie Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the statement against Kavanaugh, which slowed the vote in the Senate even further.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, "The date is not yet set, maybe this week, maybe next week, and I think it's probably a week later, given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information.
Some journalists are willing to challenge her claim that Sanders hasn't held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of briefings was due to disdain for reporters who work for the public, though she added: "I agree with the fact that they work for the public".
Then she said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
The president holds more press briefings than any president who has been before him, she said, adding without specific facts:We've been studying these numbers.
Briefings are taking place, Sanders reported, but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do this often, you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks. These meetings where you can ask the president directly, replace the briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends meetings on the street or press conferences with high-ranking foreign guests.
The president's own press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when freely and sometimes extravagantly, he appeared before reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU healthcare workers in Scotland before Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's healthcare system to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already willing to cover the cost of residency applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote, "The UK and the EU were in talks this summer to leave the EU, and they are leading to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government also rushed to prepare the script without agreement.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU, and not only, are providing valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the health care system, but they also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland  is your home and we want you to stay with us.
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has been suspended for life after suffering a head injury in a Sunday game that his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury the player received shortly before the break.
'He went over to the side line and suddenly fell,' said Reed.
Coaches and doctors gave Abercombe oxygen while he was still on the field before putting it on his arm and carrying it for diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone a pro-operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no information about what the injury was, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the player was injured.
Abercombe, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he made five complete interceptions, giving him just 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay more duty
According to the new plan of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay higher taxes and the extra money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the perceived success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in state tariffs will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The finance ministry plans to receive up to £120 million a year for homeless relief
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay higher government duties and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters and to provide affordable housing, and it's targeted at high-income people.
The government's tax increase is aimed at individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will go to the government's homeless housing program.
The current state tax increase, including the higher rates adopted two years ago, on second-home purchases and rental housing, could be as high as 3 percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and new buyers have a hard time buying their first home.
Many of the rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns, as a large number of overseas buyers live outside the UK most of the time.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in government tariffs for young buyers to make it easier to buy a first home.
He accused the big construction firms of keeping high prices on real estate by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to lift quotas on affordable housing to make things worse with housing in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of housing reforms including a rental control and an end to uninsured housing.
He also wants to give the local council more power in housing construction.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I announced that I would dedicate my work as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
It means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's unfair that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as UK workers.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: My main ambition  is to lead the Scottish national team
Coach Jack Ross has stated that his main ambition is to become a coach for the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is working on a task to restore the club from the North East, which is now in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He took over this job last summer after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But it didn't work, Ross said in a BBC Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
I grew up in Scotland, often sick at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that opportunity will come when I become a successful club coach.
Among Ross's predecessors as head coach of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moses, Sam Allard, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Pioy and Paul Di Conia.
Former coach Aloo Athletic says he was not afraid of such big names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Now luckily for me will be the answer to the question  Can I get this club back to the Premier League?
According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is probably in the Premier League, he said.
Not just bring it back there, but I will consider my job a success only if I can bring the club back there.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at Hart's headquarters.
He then helped the Falcons return from the third division and turned Saint-Myrén from a loser who nearly made it to the Championship to the next season's winner.
Ross says he's now more comfortable than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Saint-Myrne and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his work at Aloo, he said that it was a really important choice.
I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing, because I worked well, earned well, and reached a certain height.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when I talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I've always wanted to train, and I'm doing it now, and for me, this is the best time of my adult life.
The interview can be heard in full on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time
According to research, the perfect time to drink a pint of beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The hot summer boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but it put pressure on the restaurant chain.
According to pubs and bars, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July, but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Group, which compiled the statistics, said: "The continued sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English national team in the World Cup final, means that in July, what happened in June, when pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and restaurants suffered even more.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mostly sell drinks have so far shown the best results unlike restaurants.
The pubs that sell the most food also get sunburned, though not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent, and sales of food decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on leisure and accommodation, said, "These results are the trend we've seen since late April.
The climate and impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's no wonder restaurants continue to struggle, with sales down 4.8 percent a year, and that's very unpleasant when prices keep rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for operators who are focused on food, and the time will show whether lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected relief.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
The sales tracking tool at British pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an important benchmark for this industry.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children  some are only 11  has secret social media accounts that it hides from parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in the Insta page
This is a warming fear of the news that there is sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic accounting record that their parents showed them.
One in five children  some are only 11  creates social media accounts that keep secrets from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid rise in fake Instagram accounts that seem to lead to an Instagram photo sharing site.
This news has fueled fears that there will be sexual content posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept a clean, basic, account to show their parents, and they also kept a private account.
One mother who accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter found out that she was being urged to rape me.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eylde Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as an observer member of the council at the body's annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman Ian Beatty, described the event as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her experience at a wide range of levels, including international over the past decade.
"Elyde is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we're confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her work on the council", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope to help manage sport in Scotland".
The American, who won gold in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and two other Olympic gold medals, and who now works as an expert for the BBC, can't walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I was going to be better and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing a recovery exercise!
Thank you for your support!
A milk pump ad where mothers compare themselves to cows shared opinions online
A dairy pump company shared their opinions by running an ad that compared nursing women to breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of what's called the world's first infant formula pump, consumer company Elvie has released an ironic music video-based ad to show the freedom this app gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a pigsty with cows to a song where there are these words: Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail and In case you haven't noticed, it's not a trick, it's my chest.
And he said, Dave, Dave, I nurture the children; Dave, Dave, I give my wives.
However, the ad that was posted on the company's Facebook page sparked a heated debate online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and the reaction to the video was mixed, with many saying it was a dairy scare.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, and then their babies are picked up in a few days", wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden in the breastplate for nursing (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who don't take their babies away?
Someone added, "That's a thoughtless advertisement".
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she considered the song "fun".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
I wish I had one if I was breastfeeding.
Breast milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product, she wrote.
Another comment: A very entertaining ad aimed at mothers who suck milk with a pump (often at work or in a toilet) and feel like they're being sucked in.
This ad is not a highlight or a condemnation of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in their braces.
The concept of the ad campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires, no pipes, and is hidden in the braces of nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to hold children, and even leaves the house while the device is working.
Anna Ballarine, partner and creative director of Mother, said, "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the difficulty of breastfeeding milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating in a fun and convenient way how the new milk pump will bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk pump has come to the fore.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage dressed as Martha Jacobovsky, using this product.
Hundreds of immigrant children without any noise are being transported to a camp at the Texas border.
While the number of border crossings per month has remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who fear putting their own stay in the country at risk by taking responsibility for their child.
The risks increased dramatically in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would be required to submit fingerprints and the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, addressed Congress with a report on the agency's arrests of dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70% of those arrested had never been tried before.
About 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
So we continue to pursue these people, Mr. Albens said.
To speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the detention date, while, according to the staff of the shelters, the standard term was previously 60 days.
A large number of people will have to use video to file their own legal status for an immigration judge, rather than being in the courtroom in person.
Those who are deemed to have no reason to seek help are quickly deported.
According to the staff of the shelters and the reports from sources within the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions like Tarnilla, these problems are much more pronounced because signs of a child being in a state of heat are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent town without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can make the trauma that many have already experienced worse.
Syria demands the immediate withdrawal of occupying forces -- the United States, France and Turkey
In an appeal to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allim also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the war in the country for the eighth year.
Mu'allim, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil on the basis of the fight against terrorism and would be dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without imposing any conditions", he said at the Assembly meeting.
Muallem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said Damascus intends to continue this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mostly as instructors and advisers to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that are in opposition to President Bashar Assad.
France's ground contingent in this war-torn country is over 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said that conditions for return were favourable and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that refugees are being held by foreigners.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return", he says.
They're politicising a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale Syrian offensive by Russian-backed forces on the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had "precise terms" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be destroyed.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to a review of the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why is Trump going to a second term?
That's the logic behind Mr. Trump's victory in the 2020 election, when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal won't finish his presidency early.
And this will undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale in history!
At this point, there are no signs of viewers being tired.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's broadcast of The Rachel Maddow Show has garnered 3.5 million viewers and surpassed cable TV's ratings in the evening when the mainstream news was broadcast.
"This is the fire that people are drawn to, because we don't understand it", says Neil Burr, director of ABC drama "The Successor", about a Cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed.
Nelly Schuwell, a drunken comedy writer and author of a book about a few funny details and some harsh truths about infiltrating the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls a cab trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
 Why?  She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me happy", Miss Scovell told me.
Chaos is also valuable in that it can be amusing.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the storylines that come out of Washington could be as defining for the future as the Roe v. Wade case, depending on whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring  luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch the sixth hour of how a group of experts discussed Bob Woodward's use of non-print information in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket -- a garment woven with pride, as reported in "The Washington Post" -- and the consequences of Storm Daniel's sharp descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, well, it goes beyond the simple framework of wanting to be on top of things.
I'll never watch Super Mario again, for example, like I used to.
Part of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show he shows every night,  says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars about the changing cast of the Trump show and the constant twists and turns of the story (NFL sports, Kim Jong-un's approval).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you'll fall behind the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside the windows of his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, there was a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC until CNN recorded it.
He couldn't get a hold of himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging in the balance.
I remember as a kid when we were doing these crazy shows, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.

External cash flows are pouring into the tough pre-election race of midterm elections to the House of Representatives
No wonder the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is in a financial crisis as a result of Congress's amendment to the boundaries of the counties, which allows two candidates to run for the same seat.
Pittsburgh's newly redesigned suburban district surrounds a Democrat, House member Connor Lembo, who won his seat in another district at the election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely matches the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that votes in the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the campaign's funding by the major parties' financial groups, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely publicized primary in Pennsylvania's 18th District in March.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point margin.
Political experts say the Democrats have little advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already backed Beijing's position despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings wrapped up, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that would be a continuation of a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step in the effort to prevent immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and had effectively stopped the discussion of the question of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign that the administration is supporting the event.
And three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their messages were confirmed by another analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Teaching history
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, examples of what are now very important evidence in public documents.
Mr. Mueller reportedly drew attention to the possibility of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia in an election attack.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the electorate, and perhaps ultimately to the jury of his peers.
There are many cavaliers, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, just like his likes in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next few years of bloodshed.
History is wrapped around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Right now, Americans are facing a few of these turning points.
What happens if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the newspaper reported that last year he had offered to secretly record the president's words and was considering his professional suitability.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is inaccurate.
How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into the case of Brett Cavanagh is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And first of all, will we vote for Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we will not be disappointed by the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chairman of the Washington-based organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and author of the book The Last Palace: The Stormy Century of Europe in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers are taking on Rapid Venue on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to safely exit the Europa League's G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorance from making his first ever 2-2 start of the season against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use the result as a springboard.
"It was a big game for us because 'Villarreal' is a strong opponent, "says the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have scored the ball in the end, but overall the draw was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second half we took control, and we had the better half of the field.
There will be another big night for European football on Thursday.
I hope we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they did a good job in the last game, but given the crowd of fans on the podium, I'm sure we can beat them and show a good game.
It's been a tough year, obviously, both because of my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; training is productive.
Hopefully, we can move forward, overcome the results of last season and have success.
Women are losing sleep because of the fear of retirement accumulation
Although the respondents had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide survey reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking steps to discuss it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Discuss this with your husband and children: Your family will not be ready to help you unless you express your wishes beforehand.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as that choice can be a big factor in determining the cost.
You can also get a financial advisor to help you find a way to cover these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or you can insure your life yourself  provided you have the money.
Solve legal cases with legal documents: anticipate court battles.
Get trusted health care to appoint a trusted person to monitor your health care and ensure that your wishes are met by professionals in case you can't speak.
Also, consider the possibility of trusting your financial management.
Designate a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that you pay your bills when you are unable to.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write down these details in writing to be ready.
"It's not just financial issues that are involved, but the professionalism of doctors", Martin adds.
What kind of medication is needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan it.
In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The man got a few hits from a pneumatic rifle when he was walking home at night.
The victim, aged 40, was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 local time, as an accident.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking witnesses to contact them.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Because of the disconnect, humanitarian officials were unable to get any information from the Regency of Donggala, a district north of Palo Alto, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people in Palo Alto were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongla on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongla  regency, which extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency is an administrative unit with a status below the province, in 2017 it had 299,200 inhabitants.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important to the province, but is mostly concentrated in Moraval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Paulo and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people, destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck the western part of the Dongla in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below is a list of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawa Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A faint earthquake hit Pidi Jai's regency in Aceh province, causing devastation and panic, as it reminded people of the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami didn't come, but over 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin of Basil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted the reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest published Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone.
According to the KTUU channel, Palin is in the Matanusca-Susitna detention center under a $500 bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "quite innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a prison term of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B felony punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media has been making videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paulo when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor's office rarely calls for a death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipa, a suspect in a New York terror attack that killed eight people. A rare death penalty that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipa, 30, allegedly took advantage of a pick-up truck from Home Depot in October to ride a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bicyclists in its path.
To justify the death penalty, according to the intent to obtain the death penalty announced in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately beat eight people and deliberately inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both offences could be punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury charged Saipa with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of racketeering; this is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of rape and destruction of vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required careful and deliberate planning, and used phrases such as "abhorrent, cruel and outrageous" to describe Saipa's crimes.
"Saipov has caused injuries, caused damage and caused loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cléves, Ana-Lori Decadent, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Erna Ferruccio, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnoco", the intention statement said.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case against the death penalty was brought in the Southern District of New York.
Commissioner Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in New York in a federal case was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipa, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of conscientious objection in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
According to the prosecutor, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to watch the Islamic State video on the phone.
He also asked permission to hang the Islamic State flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of conspiracy, which consists of 22 counts.
David Patten, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipa, said they were "undoubtedly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the pain of these events for all involved", said Pathan.
Saipa's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at the Tory party conference, Nigel Farage swore to mobilize the People's Army.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel discomfort from eurosceptics since one of the MPs, Theresa May, offered her candidacy for the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have already emerged if Mr Farage had been Secretary for Brexit.
But the problem Ms. May faced trying to reconcile her dissented supporters got worse when Tories, who support staying in the EU, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the compromised Checker deal under constant pressure from the Brexit supporters and opponents, and the EU itself.
The Allies insist on trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and its security.
Mr. Boone said at a rally in Salihal, "Leave Means Leave", that he wants to get the Checker off the board.
He proposed that Mr. Farage be made equal and imposed the duties of negotiating with Brussels.
If he had been answering, we would have gone already, he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit, but we need to move away from the Checker Plan".
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight world wars to be addicted.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country.
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue".
And a Brexit supporter and Tory member, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march, and she told reporters, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checker plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and the activists who actually go out and elect us.
Please drop the plan and start listening.
In a sharp address to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers stay in office if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said politicians need to be made to feel uncomfortable when they're going to betray the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a matter of trust between us, nations and politicians", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "It's not going to get you out of hand".
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make those of our politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the anti-exit movement passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis was blaming the Conservatives for the security problems they faced over the opening party program.
These are the people who tell us they can have ready to use IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for borderless friction, for borderless free trade in Ireland,  he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the presidential process
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will pay close attention to the process of running for president.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about his future at a general assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to run for re-election, and she is facing Republican Jeff Dill, who was Trump's campaign co-chair in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of the debate as a potential contender for Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, this was the 36th meeting of the electorate in the form of a general assembly held on Saturday afternoon in Halifax.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that to happen, a woman should be at the head of it.
The arrest came after the death of basketball player Sims of Louisiana State University.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that the suspect in the murder of U.S.L. basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson during a news conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the person who was on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead Friday morning outside the campus of Southern University.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that killed him,  told reporters on Saturday 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stalked a friend and was shot by the Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, being armed and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot-6, 6-inch-tall junior athlete who grew up in Baton Rouge, La., Sims played in 32 games last season, 10 of which were starts, averaging 17.4 minutes on the court, tossing 5.6 points and making 2.9 rebounds per game.
Louis Hamilton is nearing the title of world champion after a team-wide agreement won over Sebastian Fettel
Ever since Walter Botos led Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it became clear that the coaching staff inside the Mercedes team played a significant role in the race.
Botos pulled out a good seat on the mooring and almost left Hamilton at his own discretion until he defended his place on the first two trailers and invited Fettel to attack his friend on the team.
Fettel first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton to turn at the end of the general mass of the racers, it was this maneuver that was to become decisive.
The pilot of the Mercedes went to the pit stop later and got out behind Fettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after several wheel-in-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, risking to hold back after a double maneuver to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and by the end of the first round was seventh.
He then led most of the race while the tires were held, as he wanted to finish fast, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He ended up going to the pit stop on lap 44, but he couldn't speed up the other eight laps, so Rykenan came in fourth.
It was a tough day because Walter was doing fantastic performances all weekend and he was a real gentleman, if I may say so.
"The team did a great job of taking first and second place", Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianna Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted she was not the source of the leaked letter from Christine Tracy Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court Justice candidate Bret Cowan of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president didn't address directly the evidence Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people can be "podal, disgusting and false".
The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly, and lying people, he said.
And when you read about press releases and escapes, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
It's not me.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document?
No, no, I'm not.
There was nothing from me.
Wait a minute.
We let the run-- no, we didn't let it go, he added, parading the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing the charges Ford brought against Kavanagh, and he escaped in early September, but Feinstein denied that the escape had taken place from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not allow her story to leak", "she told the Feinstein Committee", "The Hill reports".
She asked me to keep the story confidential, and I did.
But her denial probably didn't please the president, who said it this way during the rally on Saturday: "Here's what I'm going to tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means.
You see the vileness, the mischief, and they don't care who they hurt, who they're going to have to break through to get power and control, says President Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars  Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns for the Giants in a game against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars were defeated by the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday, winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
Thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bavile, the Giants led by two strokes in the first half.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were tied before Dwyer regained leadership of the Giants.
Francois Boucher of Dundee tied the score, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the team a two-goal victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keef's team, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; the previous three games were won by the Giants.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer with a Kendall McFall surrender, and four minutes later, Bavillier doubled the score after David Rutherford surrendered.
In the lively first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the count from the field masters, and then Coon tied the count after Matt Markward's hand (15:16).
Dwyer secured the Giants lead in the first break, scoring his second goal for the game at the end of the first period.
Taking the side overcoupled, and Buschar again tied the score, scoring a goal with the team's numerical lead (27:37).
Cowan and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in a game at the end of the second period, and he secured a win along with the team's fifth-place finisher in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their final home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A flight attendant dies saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian flight attendant died heroically, ensuring the successful takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many vanished without a trace after a massive earthquake on Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami.
Strong underground pushes are still ongoing, and many people are buried under the rubble in the city of Paulo.
While his colleagues were fleeing, 21-year-old Antonis Gunwan Agung refused to leave his position in the guard tower, which was wildly hovering at the Palau Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
It remained in place until the 6321 flight of the company Batik Air, which was at that point on the runway, tore off the ground.
Then he jumped out of the guard tower when he decided it was going to be destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian broadcaster ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirita, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimantane, which was to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of victims could reach several thousand, and the Natural Disaster Reduction Agency says access to Donggala, Siggy and Buton is limited.
A representative of the agency Sotopa Purva Nugroho reported: "The number of victims may increase further, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig up from the rubble".
Waves of up to six meters swept Paula, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, a car is bringing bodies in.
Clean water is scarce.
Shops are robbing everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don't know what awaits them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Jock Vidodo arrived in Paulo on Sunday and told the military, "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by the Lomboc earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reported that one person went missing without a report after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operated the flight that made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew had been successfully evacuated from the sinking plane, and now reports one passenger missing without report.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday it cannot report the location of a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately provide details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water while attempting to land at the Chukchi Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday; all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unknown.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon without reaching the passenger lane.
According to some witnesses, the plane jumped over the passenger lane.
According to American passenger Bill Jans, the plane was flying very low.
"It was very successful", "Jane's reported".
He said he and others were able to get through the water belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said the cabin crew panicked and started screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who were repairing nearby harbours also helped rescue the ship by using a floating boat to carry people ashore until the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in a plane crash in Papua New Guinea over the past 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst restores the course of events on the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded the presentation of evidence in the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett for several hours presented his credentials as an expert in information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the movements of 29-year-old respondent Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Roulette, he received a location report from several cell phones that indicated that Tallis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statement.
When the data that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone while, he claimed, he was with his friend Michael Sanford was confirmed, the police were on their way to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford gave a speech on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tallis was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that night, he said he was lying, since my van was in Nashville.
Another controversy was Tallis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records showed they had known each other for a week.
According to Roulette, some time after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
'He steered her out of his life,' said Haley.
The side of the defense should begin the dispute of the parties on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio is intent on challenging the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive settings.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based band, says hip-hop has moved away from its roots: political claims and introspective issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Performers like Akala and Lowkey have brought back popularity in the UK with bands like The Fugees and Common.
Another black woman?!
New York nurses sued the couple for a racist message after firing
A New York nanny is suing a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a random message from her mother complaining that she is another black woman.
The couple denies they are racist, equating the claims to "victory".
In 2016, Lindsay Plasco-Flacksman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Jezeel Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
"None, One More Black", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent a message to Miss Morris twice.
As the New York Post reports, after realizing the mistake, Placquaxman dismissed Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also African-American, was doing poorly at work and that she was waiting for her Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris paid for the day's work and was sent home on Uber.
Now Morris is suing for damages and wants to get compensation for dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, although without a contract: $350 a day for six months of living.
I want to show them that they can't do that, she told the Post on Friday. I know it's discrimination.
The couple denied the accusations of racism, arguing that firing Morris was a reasonable decision, given that they could not trust her after insulting her.
My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, reported Postman, Joel Plac.
And would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even by chance?
Your baby?
Did you?
Placqua equates the appeal to the competition and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
And you're going to chase a man in that position?
It's pretty tough, added an investment banking expert.
While the legal proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, sharply criticizing their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were concerned that readers would not sympathize with a bear speaking, speaking in a new leaf.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
So interesting to read, already knowing about Paddington's great success.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was optimistic despite his work being rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was bitter-sweet after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family.
'He was a rather quiet man, and not at all boastful,' she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parental honour for a child to have accomplished something: you are proud of them, though in fact it is not your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that very way.
Though it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave his due to Paddington himself.
My daughter died, and I had to chat with her on the phone.
After her arrival, her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"I called her regularly to tell her that it was really bad, that she couldn't stand it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I was called over to say she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to beat her heart were slowly leaving her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that it was all happening.
I could not weep, cry, or weep, for I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stick".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperois, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she had to go through.
'No one knew,' she said.
I bowed my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I was struck by a feeling of compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women who are sad are hanging cards to warn suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones, who ended up committing suicide, are trying to keep other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are hanging up cards with warm words and phone numbers for people to get help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
'I don't want other parents to feel the way I feel,' she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew his smile.
People said his smile would light up any room.
But before he died, he quit his job because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the unpleasant consequences.
Mrs. Davis created the cards, so people would know that there are people in the world you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent  you need to talk.
Mrs. Hasfrith, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the day of the holiday he was very upset: when the children opened presents, he didn't even look at them.
She said that his death was a great injury to them, but they had to live with it: In the family a huge hole appeared.
It just kills us.
But you have to keep living and fighting.

The future of Breta Kavanaugh is uncertain, as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought we could have what he wanted  limited in time and in scope of investigation  we could get a little unity, said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was being upset because it was actually stuck.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to lose, then they will be weakened in their efforts to elect the candidate they want to the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the senator to get the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the issue of equal voting and to approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under Kim Jong-un's leadership.
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo-sun, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 survivors last year, up from 2,076 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reasons for this were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs imposed by smugglers on smuggling.
Pyongyang has not commented on this.
Most of the refugees from the north get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which is the longest border in North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas, which is heavily guarded.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South  which are technically still at war  have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to a common term to work towards a complete nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yan Ho accused the US sanctions of not making any progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these conditions, we will not be the first to disarm", Mr. Rhee said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical, she says he shouldn't be working in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical person and stated that he was not fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called "hysterical", and Pelosi was asked about her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christina Blazey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when his family and the senior class of the school were discussing.
He also blamed the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and organized murder of a person" by liberals who were furious that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's speech showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he clearly showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if elected and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he not only shouldn't work in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he works now, Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh was considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for hysterical, unobjective individuals to go to court and expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And a woman should know that.
It's a justified accusative speech, months and years of anger just flows, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", said Miss Stein 45 years ago.
I don't think it's that rare.
She continued, "I was a great help to a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and she said that when she got angry, she cried, but she developed a behavior technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry.
And I just kept going.
I think it was great.
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of grief, because they're completely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of my first job was when I once cried out of inexpressible anger, when I was grabbed by an old woman, a restrained boss, who always scared me a little bit, and pulled me upstairs.
'Never let them see you in tears,' she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad to have you.
Patricia Schroder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was betrayed by a married couple on a yacht called Monkey Business and dropped out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroder thought she could participate in the presidential campaign herself.
"It was not a very well thought out decision", she laughed and told me 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates, and they didn't need me.
Someone called this situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
And since the campaign had been going on for quite a while, it lacked the funds, so she said she wouldn't run until she raised $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turns out that some of her fans, who donated $1,000 to the man, gave her only $250.
'They think I'm going with a discount?' she thought.
When she announced that she would not run for office, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her -- anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and targeted the voters, not the candidates -- and anger at sexism -- that she took her breath away.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroder recalled the press' reaction to her condition.
You might think my corporate sponsor is the paper tissue manufacturer Kleenex.
I used to think, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
Why a trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first outbursts of the China-US trade war were daunting, and as the war is far from over, in the longer term, misunderstandings between the countries could be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week when new tariffs hit $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods that come to the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in this way every time, raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from 5 to 10 percent recently.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to follow suit.
Forcing Washington to back off requires a lot of digging, but public inclination toward the United States is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the US trade war in the long run could support China, reducing the interdependence between the two countries.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a sharp economic downturn is far more dangerous than observers previously believed", said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions to return the refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are six million more people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'al said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States is losing for the sixth time in a row on European soil and hasn't won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe was crowned when the team of Dutch captain Thomas Björn scored 14.5 points, which was necessary to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most successful wrestler in the tournament, kicked the ball into the water on the 3rd pair of 16th lunes, withdrawing this match from Francesco Maliniara.
Italian golfer Maliniari has played well in all rounds, becoming one of four players to have passed this field 5-0-0 since the start of the current tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spice was beaten 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorneburn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Paulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia became the player with the most career wins at the tournament with 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to give back the cup.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said the shaken Garcia after the European team won.
He handed over the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday played the legendary Tiger Woods in the 2&1 singles.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I've been watching since childhood", said 23-year-old Romy.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team competed against each other except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tinnie Fines, who played golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning, we sometimes showed Europe what we were capable of.
We fought.
Let's take off the hat in honor of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Golf Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We were being played.
Red tide information: Concentration is decreasing in the Pinellas, Monati and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Committee shows a general decline in the concentration of red tides in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the committee's information, there are reportedly some blooming sites in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Cooley, which means a decrease in concentration.
The red tide flows approximately 130 miles (200 km) of coastline from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Flowers can be found about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but they're declining in numbers over the past few weeks.
Red tides were also seen in Pasca County.
The concentration of medium-sized on the shore or near the shore in Pinellas County was observed last week, in Hillsborough the concentration was from low to high. in Monatt's background to high, on the shore or near the shore in Saratoga County the concentration was from the background to high, in Charlotte County from the background to medium, on the shore or near the shore in Lee County from the background to high and in Collier County the low concentration.
Respiratory irritation has been reported from Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Calle County.
Last week, there were no reports of airway irritation from Northwest Florida.
