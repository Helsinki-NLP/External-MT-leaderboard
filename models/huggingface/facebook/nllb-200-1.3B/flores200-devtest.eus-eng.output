This confirms the theory that some dinosaurs had feathers and reveals details that fossils generally cannot, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was brownish on the top and carotenoid or light colored on the bottom.
The findings also provide details about the behaviour of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed coating (called a rack) but do have other feather features (feather-beards); therefore, researchers have concluded that the rack developed later in evolution than the other features mentioned.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or change shape.[1] The researchers suggest that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not the feathers of a young.

Just as the force exerted by the Moon on the Earth causes tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the entire Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter in the galaxy's atmosphere is in a halo around the galaxy, made up of many tiny particles.

The road at the scene of the accident was temporarily closed while emergency services evacuated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of his son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the evidence from the witnesses may not be entirely credible, given that his photographs have been published widely.
This is common practice in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts feel that publishing photos can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee says that journalists walk a thin line when they post pictures of suspects and so on.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the investigation, has told reporters that it will not comment further, at least until the investigation is completed.
According to the leak, the document is about the border riot, which is about Palestine's desire to reclaim the borders that were there before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues reportedly being discussed include the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Valley for the next 10 years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine wants to limit the stay to five years.
The hunters who were undergoing the supplementary pest control test were closely monitored by the forest rangers who were monitoring the test and evaluating its effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (New South Wales), qualified volunteers were selected as part of the Sport Shooters Association hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's Executive Director of Conservation and Heritage Park, said that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received a full safety and training briefing.
Martelly was sworn in as the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth C.E.A. in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the existing CEO should resign as part of the country's steps toward holding new elections.
The committee was created by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
There were several protests, some violent, over the inability to hold elections that had not been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning, overheated iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has reported 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had received 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company said were caused by the heat.
The ministry responded by saying it was "absolutely regrettable" that Apple had reported the cases so late.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (GMT 21:19, Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Bureau reports no damage reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has confirmed that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostage Hong Kong tourists in Manila, Philippines, after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A number of hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and studied medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in her spare time.
The study we did showed that giving a hormone accelerated the fetal lung development.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two black boxes that were recorded during the flight on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Luna was the first queen of the extreme, my first manager, and she died on a moonlit night, a special night, just like her, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was a freak like me, maybe more than me. I love her and I'm gonna miss her, and I hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and since 2008 there has been an 8 percent increase in the number of people who are against Australia becoming a republic.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gilliard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of people who responded to the poll have the same opinion, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the mines she has mentioned her season has been called into question.
The pain medication he needs has not been able to take because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the first known greatest number on January 25.
By early February, the discovery had been verified by a number of individuals using various hardware and software, and the discovery was reported on Tuesday.
It is possible that the flare stars were one of the sources that supplied the Earth with water, as well as organic matter that can help create proteins and develop life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth came into being after asteroids collided with the Earth centuries ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, signing a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He calls rumors "political nonsense".
He made a reference to running for president in 2016.
The FAA says the NextGen system will allow planes to fly shorter flights and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to outdated technology based on ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately locate the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transportation and no overhead trains stopping at Wembley, and there are no parking facilities or parking and departure facilities outside.
Fearing a traffic jam, he put the possibility of having to play the game with people and fans of the teams on the table.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported that a new species of bird is being bred on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has emerged in two generations, although the process was thought to be much longer; in fact, they have co-reproduced Darwin's shont (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus shont (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into any shape, rolled into tiny shapes.
You can pull it until it's thin, you can twist it and shrink it, you can twist it, you can crush it into a sheet.
The layer can be made thin and glued with another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
That's called the pH of a chemical compound, and you can make an indicator out of red cabbage water.
The color of the water varies depending on the acidity or the alkalinity of the chemical compound.
The pH level indicates how many hydrogen ions (H of pH) are present in the chemical compound used for the test.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (in fact, a proton and an ion make up a hydrogen atom).
Mix the two dry powders together and shrink them with wet, clean hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the layers outside, giving it a special feel, and forming a kind of shell.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a toilet with a splash water, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Traces of a sewage system have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets, and during the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would spend time together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and distorts our vision.
You need a spacecraft that's more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has dramatically changed the world, and the greatest thing the wheel has ever done for us is that it allows us to move faster and easier.
He's brought us a train, a car, and other transportation equipment.
Below them are medium-sized cats, eating medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many other small cats (including domestic cats) that eat larger, smaller prey such as insects, rodents, snails, and birds.
Their success is based on the concept of the Nishō, where each type of cat does a specific job so that they don't have to compete with the others.
Lions are social cats, and they usually live in large herds.
The lion herds usually have between one and three male lions and thirty females and cubs.
The females are closer together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds function similarly to wolf or dog herds; they are very similar to lions in behavior (but not like other big cats) and are extremely dangerous to prey.
The tiger is a very good athlete, able to climb (although not very well), swim, make high jumps and pull with five times more force than a strong person.
The tiger is the only cat that can murmur, and is the only one that can.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, it's more like a threatening phrase consisting of a threatening word shouted.
The only way to get rid of the pain is to get rid of the pain, and then to get rid of the pain, and then to get rid of the pain.

The Ozelotes are a group of animals that live in the wild, and are known for their ability to hunt, hunt, and hunt.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from its original main population (e.g., if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it cannot easily return from a new island), it will often find itself in an environment unlike before.
Such an environment has different resources and competitors, and thus new populations will need different characteristics or adaptations from those they previously needed to be strong competitors.
The original population has not changed at all, because they still need the same adjustments as before.
As time passes, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment and becomes less and less similar to the original population.
Eventually, after thousands, maybe millions of years, the two populations will be so different from each other that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process speciation; it simply means the creation of a new species. Specialization is inevitable; it's an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans expel (i.e., exhale).
Plants feed on the sun's light through photosynthesis and provide shade.
The fact that the animals are not able to eat the plants is a major reason why they are not able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the leading predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anyone except other Mosasaurs.
It had a long jaw, filled with 70 sharp teeth, and a set of teeth in its mouth so that nothing could escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a tongue-bifido, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's thought he may have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water, not even the great T. Rex.
Although most Roman food is familiar to us, they also had rare or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, bird, snail or a rodent called a mussel.
Another difference was that poor people and women usually ate seated, and rich men often ate side by side, lying on their sides.
The ancient Romans could not eat the food that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
They had no corn, they had no tomatoes, they had no potatoes, they had no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god, which they considered to be the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the god, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, as well as an inner sanctuary, which was only open to priests.
Pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open showrooms facing the street; they built their houses out of stone.
There were few forests in Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
There were not many people in Greenland, but in the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, the area was already inhabited by the Eskimo tribes.
Although each of these countries was considered Scandinavian, there were huge differences between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland -- people, kings, customs, history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Even if it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence is inscribed on the backside with the words: "Declaration of Independence, original, dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one is sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document was originally rolled up for storage (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches).
So maybe she just added the note as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
The Vichy regime was dominated by the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940, working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and French forces liberated southern France and began moving toward Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together in a cooperative manner as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it defines the size of a society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations, and a civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through generations, there is a cultural footprint, and there is an equitable transmission.
Lower-level cultures disappear without significant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government, with the Congress as its only component, and subject to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, with no national executive or judicial branch, state officials had the power to enforce its laws, though they often did not cooperate.
Furthermore, it had no authority to invalidate interstate tax laws or charges.
They needed the unanimous consent of all the states before they could change the articles, and the states treated central government so lightly that their representatives rarely even appeared.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful football team in the world, and were the winners of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
In the northern regions, winter sports are the most practiced, and Italians compete in international games and Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, it is geographically designated as the archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through it and named the island Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company settled in southwest Taiwan, and the native inhabitants began to transform their crop-producing activities, as well as employ Chinese laborers to work on the rice and sugar plantations there.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) captured the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to show tourists what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty-three percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and it is still being restored.
For example, in still image photography, the 35 mm format is the most common in the world, as this was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been continued by the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
In fact, confusingly enough, the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest even-numbered ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) have this ratio or approximate.
The overused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamics in an image while maintaining some order.
The rule states that the most effective places to place the main subject are the points where the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds cross (see example).
At this time in European history, they began to look closely at the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united the European states, despite their different languages and customs.
His mighty power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are used for exactly that purpose.
The central authority of the Church was established in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised doubts among many as to whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of the offensive, Britain began to blockade German shipping.
The blockade of basic military and civilian supplies was an effective strategy, but it violated the generally accepted international law codified by numerous international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain had placed mines in international waters, preventing ships from reaching large parts of the ocean and endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic was given a limited response, Germany hoped that the unlimited underwater warfare it was initiating would have a similar response.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were determined to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry and letters of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing each era, and each era or ruling family in China was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, the inter-dynastic period was marked by a period of unstable provincial division, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days, there were fierce wars between the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the right to sit on the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are various social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were made available to all men, and as a result, those with the most ambition and success thrived.
The same thing happened with the military, where instead of ranking by class, it was based on caliber.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired the working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in matters beyond the everyday life, and frequently visited a cave for contemplation, called Hira, which was located on the mountain Noor (light).
The cave, which has survived through time, clearly indicates Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even the location makes it hard to find, inside the cave, it's lonely.
You can only see the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, and there's very little of this world that you can see or hear from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Man is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing today.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century A.D., one of the largest pyramidal structures ever built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The plains of Giza in the Egyptian Valley of Death or the Necropolis of Giza contain several pyramids, small tombs, temples, and even the Great Sphinx (the largest of all the great pyramids).
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids and tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward-moving mark is V-shaped and the downward-moving mark is a grape or a square with the bottom missing.
Going up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and going down means you start at the base -- where you hold the bow -- and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger, denser sound.
You can make your own marks with pencils, but printed bow marks are for musical reasons, and so they should be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Maria Teresa and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a large group of women market-goers on 6 October 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage accompanied by a noisy mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At a certain moment, a member of the crowd at Versailles shook the head of a slain royal guard in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs incurred by the US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
The American colonial regime was forced to pay taxes for a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the profits from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which order was created.
The period of these events is called the Classical Middle Ages of European history, and covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Classic Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages, followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism includes many ideas in practice, including the belief that the impulse or necessity of technology, that the fate of human beings is guided by a hidden logic under the laws of science (and how they are expressed in technology).
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general ideas in common: that the development of technology goes beyond any political or cultural power, and that technology simultaneously has more influence on societies themselves than societies have on technology.
For example, one might say that the advent of motorized cars inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable if there are only a few cars; so new production methods are developed to make car ownership cheaper.
The more massive car ownership, the more road accidents, but this also requires the development of new techniques for the treatment of injured people in the healthcare field.
Romanticism was an important element of cultural determinism derived from Goethe, Fichte, Schlegel and similar writers.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures associated with geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws as they conformed to the place of society.
In the contemporary world, we think of Paris as the fashion capital, but in feudal Europe, Constantinople was the center.
It began to be the epicenter of luxury around 400 AD, and its popularity lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined in the 12th century, mainly because the returning crusaders brought silk fabrics and spices as gifts, which were valued more than they were offered on the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Constantinople ceased to be the capital of fashion in favour of Paris.
The height of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the costumes were heavily influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, styles arrived in the West with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, with the use of knobs to tie clothes.
Sustainable farming is the practice of producing enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Sustainable farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses stored seeds from the agricultural region and crop rotation or similar simple techniques to obtain the greatest possible harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced sustainability farming, and it's still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ways of thinking and who feel they are outside of social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
There are many ways to classify subcultures, such as age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture make distinctive and symbolic use of style to show their commonality, which includes fashions, peculiarities and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, were neglected, miserable, or intentionally abused, and who did not have the opportunity to socialize with adults.
These children are known as wild. Some wild children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents), others were abandoned by parents who did not accept a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is likely that these savage children experienced severe abuse or trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or fled.
Some say they were raised by animals, others say they lived their lives in the wild.
In the case of wild babies raised by non-human animals, they tend to exhibit behaviors that are almost identical to that of a particular care animal (within physical limits), such as fear or lack of interest towards humans.
While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it a step further.
The alteration method is not a method of learning, but rather a way of assisting those who are immersed in a new learning experience, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, and a clip-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aldiums are embedded in the software, providing questions, notes and explanations about procedures that may be difficult for students to manage alone.
Children come to the reception for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, blackmail.
Children shouldn't grow up in an environment that doesn't provide support, care and education, but that's what happens.
For such children, we'd like to think of a safe zone as the Welcome System.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The receptionist must provide all the necessities that they lacked in the houses they left behind.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The multiple features of the Internet have allowed for additional aspects related to usability and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialising" are considered to be the main motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued engagement" were also identified as a motivating factor by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied people's reactions to websites.
Using video recordings has made important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, one can detect whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, the President's speech in a scientific article, suggested that people who suffer from brain damage and are unable to understand speech are able to perceive honesty directly.
The only way to get rid of the animal is to get rid of the animal.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variants: the implicit and the expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variants, while selection removes them from the set of identified variants.
Separation and recombination involve variation from one set to the next in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to a human has a difficult time getting the right amino acids from the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, failure to achieve this can have devastating consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The protein in their leaves and shoots would be the most abundant plant resources available, but it's hard for primates like us to digest when uncooked.
Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise you that our ancestors solved the protein problem the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
During the process of sleep interruption, you wake up deliberately during normal sleep and fall back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
That can be easily achieved by using a low-level alarm that makes you conscious but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you reset the clock while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythms is to drink plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which is a well-known diuretic) to force you to get up to pee.
The amount of inner peace a person feels is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and all people have the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Enlightenment is something we can all achieve, and the only thing that's going to stop us from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but spread with the Mahayana way of love and the numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga, through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, is activated by the Kundalini energy.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, where the manifestation of various gods clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the awareness of illumination.
Germany was the enemy of many during World War II, which led to the USSR-US cooperation. At the end of the war, clashes in systems, processes and culture caused the countries to drift apart.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies turned enemies and the Cold War began.
The next 40 years were war, real fighting, with paramilitary forces, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, almost overnight these plans were rendered obsolete when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Polish regions, thereby violating the Riga Peace Accord, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of freight ships is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional job of the Marines has been to keep countries from moving people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving people and goods.
The most prominent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to send men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Similarly, the German Navy used U-boats to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Britain might have been able to conquer Germany, as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began raising goats for easy access to milk, hair, meat and fur.
Goats were usually kept in herds, which were active in hills or other pastures, under the care of goats, which were children or adolescents, similar to the more common shepherds.
Orbital tunnels were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the orgaways were only parallel wooden planks, dragging by horses allowed them to take higher speeds and carry heavier loads on the rough roads of the time.
The Habsans were added early enough to establish the rails, but gradually they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a rail on top.
It became commonplace, but the effects of iron made the wooden wheels of the organs wear more.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made of pure iron were used.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking, as humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means standing man).
Their early Australopithecines did not walk upright.
Biped specializations have been found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a cleaner, environmentally friendly life, we can join environmental mobilizations, and we can even become activists to help reduce suffering in the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we're looking for a permanent solution, we need to find the root cause of the problems so we can solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and that the problems have been exacerbated by the overpopulation and the humanity's wasteful way of life.
After approval by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap's printing press.
What are known as the Dunlap Papers were made in 150 to 200 copies that night.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of the copies was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his army on July 9 in New York City, and on August 10 a copy arrived in London.
The oldest copies of the document that have survived are the 25 Dunlap papers.
Many modern paleontologists believe that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
But in many ways, birds are similar to dinosaurs.
They have shells and claws on their feet, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (or in computer usage, bits).
The intestinal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, but vomiting and other symptoms are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
An open can of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indicator of intestinal intoxication.
You should read the label to find out the first-aid options for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bugs to refer to this group of insects.
The name is derived from their resemblance to ancient bedbugs, which have a high capacity to parasitize humans.
Both killer bedbugs and bed bugs are nidicles, and they are used to living in nests and hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis, making it a common neurological disorder among young adults and middle-aged people.
AD is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is comprised of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to have AS as men.
It can happen that a couple decides that raising a baby is not what's best for them or the baby.
Maybe this couple is making an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights to the other parent to become the child's parent.
Under the scientific method, understanding how the world works is the primary goal of science, in fact, it is the method that guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing that must be done; an experiment is also a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, and observation also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including philosophy, were accepted.
As Grezia's knowledge declined, the West became more distant from its philosophical and scientific origins.
The existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks is crucial for many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living things: bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that continue to work on their own for a period of time even when there is no external signal.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key clues to the fact that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phagocytes, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments: they marked the phagous DNA with radioactive phosphorus or they marked the phagous protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material it affects and whether or not the cells they affect are germline cells.
Mutations in the germ line cells only pass to the babies, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas, who go with the aim of enjoying the landscape (including fauna and flora).
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
Like visiting, photographing and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns to go to work and meet people who are working in the same place they just left.
As part of this transport dynamic, the whole world is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, and protecting it.
Science has shown that this tremendous carbon saving has altered the stable state of the biosphere over the last two million years, which has supported the evolution of the human race.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses the transportation systems.
Rarely in developed countries do we hear so many complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day, are transport technicians unqualified, or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flows study the movement and interrelationships of individual drivers and vehicles between two destinations.
Unfortunately, tracking traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers have fairly regular behavior, so traffic flows are fairly consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To best describe the flow of traffic, relationships have been specified in three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and legal of road services.
Insects were the first to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and reproductive partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings behind their bodies.
This allows them to hide in smaller places to avoid predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the witch needles and the ephemeroptera.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and so did the sun (and the other stars).
That makes sense, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
About 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Giza pyramids were never beaten in terms of their size and engineering excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then 1,000 years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least densely populated.
In the Vatican City, Italian is used in local laws and official notices.
Italian is also the common language of most people working in the public service, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Gold, silver, copper and other chemical elements have been known to man since ancient times, as they can be found in nature in their primitive form and can be relatively easily harvested with raw tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things were made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
He also theorized that the four states of matter, solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, are converted into other substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as those containing carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them could fit in at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was invented, a lot of people became close friends with it.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing are invented, the pencil has fallen into a lower status and use.
People now type messages on their computer screens without ever having to go back and pick up a clipper.
Who knows what's gonna happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
The functioning of a fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like carrying a heavy object up a slope, and when you split the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break with little or no help.
The surface of the moon is mostly composed of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the front and about 100 km wide on the back.
It's thinner under the moon's seas, and thicker at high altitudes.
There might be more moon sea on the front, because the surface is thinner, so it was easier to get the lava to the surface.
The point of content theories is to find out what makes people different or what attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wants that they tend to embrace as they reach adulthood.
These theories focus on two ideas: why people want things and what things around them will motivate them to do certain things or not.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two of his most famous theories.
In general, two behaviors can arise when a director begins to direct his former colleagues: one, to remain a "boy" (or "girl") of the "team".
It's hard for managers like this to make decisions they don't like, to maintain discipline, to evaluate performance, to delegate responsibility and to find people to take responsibility.
On the other hand, he becomes the unknowable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, it is the leader who is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to tensions between the team leaders and other members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are a few slight differences.
Members of virtual teams act as a point of contact for their live physical team.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional groups, perhaps because groups meet in shifting time zones, which their local leadership does not understand.
The presence of a real invisible group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive component of a virtual group.
The invisible team is the management team that each member reports to, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the lengthy process of creating an educational institution? Innovation is one of the goals of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
When available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence can flourish.
As a result, a process of working together to address a barrier in an organization can lead to innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
The continuum approach is described by Engel (2006) as a method for achieving higher levels of performance by organizations.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognition, thus narrowing and making the field of study much more specific.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting the current research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and alter certain brain functions.
The rise of modern technology has allowed us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that were never seen before.
And this gives us a lot of information and material to build stimulation models, which helps us understand what's going on in the brain.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important branch of computer science, encompassing machine behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence.
In the research of AI, we train machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
To name a few: control, planning and organization, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and calligraphy, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become a separate discipline, dedicated to providing solutions to life's problems.
AA systems are widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, but also in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of a classroom, so often the teacher would like to take the students somewhere they can't get on a bus.
The technology offers a virtual excursion solution where they can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful artworks while the students sit next to classmates.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on the excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital, and the site changes every year, but the old versions are kept on the Internet as a book of cuts.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and although students often start a blog with poor grammar and spelling, having readers often changes that.
Since the most diligent readers are often students, the writer of the blog begins to make efforts to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to learn more about the world around them, and to be intelligent and interesting, and to satisfy the needs of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to encourage collaboration, and it encourages students to share knowledge beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs can enable students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can specify their position in the context of other people's writings, as well as summarize their own viewpoint on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's magnificent, bilingual capital, and has a good selection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south, Niagara Falls, and further north, the unspoiled natural beauty of Muscoco.
All of these things and more make Ontario the most Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost deserted forests.
One thing that surprises many people about population: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, with a large margin, and it's a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France, and are popular as luxury holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and they took over a large area in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route to travel from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies, all female passengers are advised to declare their marital status, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but one that doesn't seem very expensive).
Women need to know that what they may perceive as harassment behaviours are cultural differences, and that it's common for someone to follow them, to hold their arm, and so on.
Be tough when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stick with them (cultural differences or not, it's not appropriate!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the same fishermen in the 20th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and sailors as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt Casa Branca under the title, but it was abandoned after a 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least popular shopping destination in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina you can easily find traditional Moroccan creatures such as daggers, ceramics, leather goods, nargiles and all kinds of gadgets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adjacent to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, when lava flooded the city streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is safe enough, all visits outside of Goma must be reviewed to determine the current state of the fighting in the northern province of Kivu.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragong volcano, as well as the cheapest trails to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a Boda-Bod (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, the usual (inclusive) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Since it is somewhat difficult to reach, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for speaking of exotic and remote lands.
Today, it is a poor town, but its fame as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites because of the threat of desert sand.
One of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "The Wonderful Land of Africa", was the show.
There is a big difference between this city and the rest of the country, with the Arabic rather than the African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each of which is home to a diverse fauna.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily quotas for access to the park and for conservation.
Maybe someone could use a Wild Card, which gives them access to South Africa's parks, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, is the main attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bright bar-diagram, which is displayed with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the adjacent Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in the reclaimed area on the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for clues to the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest range of marine mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest covering Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps; there are also the last remnants of the enormous forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are about 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 tiger ticks living there.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Inter-district buses are often crowded, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have Japanese shore bus services, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are quick and convenient transportation to nearby places such as Parora (Nu 150) and Punakhara (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapok River and connects Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, and the bridge has two lanes of 378 metres long and 3,50 metres wide.
The bridge is 15 metres high.[1] Construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.[2]
The bridge is expected to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs are completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing sustainability farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá tribes, who lived by hunting, archery and fishing.
The 16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", was the result of a mixture between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
It began with the Spanish colonization and lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous identity and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
You can also watch smaller tournaments and matches here throughout the year.
For news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the website of Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the island that can change money is Stanley's, which is way past FIC West.
They accept British pounds everywhere and at Stanley they accept credit cards and US dollars.
The neighboring islands may not accept credit cards, but they do accept British and American money, so ask the owners in advance if you can use that payment method.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland Islands money outside the islands, so change your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
It is located in the subtropical Montevideo, and in the summer months, it is common for temperatures to be above 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be very cool; it's not uncommon to freeze, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no known rainy or dry season: the same amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Although most of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the fauna is wild and cannot be fed or disturbed.
According to park authority, stay at least 100 yards or meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards or meters from other wild animals.
Although they may look soft, bison, moose, bear, and all other large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get hurt for not keeping proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous water dispute of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the village led to the assassination of the chief leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is located between the two ports, there are numerous beaches, the most famous in three zones.
The beaches on the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean; they extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches, so it's safe to swim, and there's mostly shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Waitemata Harbour in central Auckland, the beaches of Tamaki Drive in the upscale neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These beaches are often crowded with families, and there are many shops along the coast, so it's safe to swim there.
The local beer is called "Number One", which is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australia are better.
The local spring water is safe to drink, but bottled water can be found anywhere if you're not too trusting.
For Australians, flat white coffee is unusual, with the plain coffee being called espresso, the cappuccino being served with milkshake (without the skim) and the tea being served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards, the juice is expensive but delicious.
Excursions to the reefs are held throughout the year and injuries associated with these activities are extremely rare.
However, please respect the authorities' instructions, follow the signs and pay close attention to security measures.
The cubozoa are found on beaches and in estuaries of rivers between October and April 1770 in the northern hemisphere, and can also be found outside this area during this time.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, so most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By making a reservation in advance, the passenger can feel more comfortable knowing that he has a place to sleep.
Travel agents usually have offers for specific hotels, but you can use their services to find other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agents usually offer offers that combine breakfast, airport or airport transport or flight and hotel.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to think about the offer or prepare your travel documentation (e.g. visa).
Changes or orders must be made through the travel agent, not by contacting the hotel directly.
In the case of some festivals, most of the music festival participants choose to camp there, and most people consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activities, you should leave early, find a campsite near the music area.
Please note that even if the music on the main stages is over, other venues of the festival may continue to play until late.
Some festivals have camping areas that families with children can use.
If you're traveling through the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice creates a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruise ships in St. Petersburg also provide the opportunity to spend time in the city, with cruise passengers not having any visa-related obligations (see specifications).
Casinos make every effort to ensure that guests waste as much time and money as possible, there are usually no windows, no clocks, and the exits are not easy to find.
Special offers of food, drink and entertainment are often made to keep guests in good spirits and to stay.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house's expense, but drunkenness and common sense are incompatible, and even the best gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Those who plan to drive in high latitudes or through mountains should consider that snow, ice or very low temperatures can occur.
On frozen or snow-covered roads, there is very little friction and it cannot be driven as on asphalt.
When there's a storm, it can snow enough to get you stuck.
There may be a limited visibility due to snow or condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, frosts and snowfalls are common in many countries and traffic is normally uninterrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are a major tourist attraction and for many visitors, an unforgettable experience.
The term safari, in layman's terms, specifically refers to a journey to see the fauna that lives in the African savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come up to the cars and with standard equipment you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you'll see them better with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also called bushwalking, walking safaris or walking safaris) are walks that last for several hours.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you've booked a flight and a hotel for 2020 before we've been informed of the delay, you could be in a tough spot.
The cancellation guidelines may be changed, but the cancellations due to the coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, the date of the Olympics.
Tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 ¥.
Many hotels have iron and sand to lend, even if there is none in the room.
If there is no iron available or you don't like to wear polished socks, you can use a hair dryer as an option, if one is available.
Do not overheat the fabric (it may shrink or, in the worst case, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others in terms of known risks.
In some places, you can boil water for a minute; in others, it takes a few minutes.
Some filters are more effective than others, and if you're concerned, we recommend you buy a sealed water bottle from a major company.
The animals are not the only ones who are affected by the disease.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause an allergic reaction, even spreading poison or transmitting infections.
The animals are not considered pests, but they are considered to be pests.
Shopping duty-free is a good option to buy duty-free products in certain places.
Travelers in countries with high taxes can save a fortune, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.

You don't need a boat on the archipelago or the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough to fit any yacht, small boats or kayaks offer a different experience.
Navigation is the most common leisure activity in Finland, and as such there is a boat for seven or eight people.

However, this option is not cheap: usually, a business flight is four times more expensive than an economy fare and, in the case of first class, eleven times more expensive!
