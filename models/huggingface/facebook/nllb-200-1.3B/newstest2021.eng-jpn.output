NEW DELHI (AP) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th century mosque was demolished by Hindu hardliners in 1992, according to the trust overseeing the temple construction.️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The ceremony is set for Aug. 5, a date organizers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marks a year since the Indian Parliament revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.

United, Chelsea in the Premier League; Bournemouth, Watford down from EPL

Leicester, on the other hand, will play in the Europa League along with Tottenham, who drew 1-1 at Crystal Palace to secure sixth place - above Wolverhampton on goal difference.
The battle to avoid the two remaining relegation places went to the wire as Aston Villa scored in the 84th minute, conceded a minute later, then held on for 1-1 draw at West Ham to survive.
Jack Grealish scored Villa's goal in what could be his last game for his boyhood club.
Bournemouth did what it had to do and beat Everton, 3-1, but ended up one point behind Villa.
Watford was also relegated as the next-to-last team after losing 3-2 to Arsenal.
Manchester City supered 100 goals for the campaign with a 5-0 win over last-place and already-degraded Norwich, a game that marked the last in the Premier League for David Silva after 10 years with City.

"Falings" in US are holding back search for coronavirus drugs
The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in an "arbitrary, willy-nilly way", the expert leading the UK's program has warned.
UK's Recovery Trial programme, which has involved 12,000 patients in several hundred British hospitals, has already identified one promising new drug to tackle the disease and also highlighted two others - previously thought to be potential life-saving - as useless.

Ted Cruz says Pelosi's objectives are "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down"
Washington - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down" as negotiations on the next measure continue. The House Democrats accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down" as negotiations on the next measure continue.

President Trump last week demanded the next aid package include a payroll tax cut, but Mnuchin said it won't be part of the legislation, as the proposal was badly received among Republicans.
Mr. Trump acknowledged the payroll tax cut would be absent from the next bill but sought to pin the blame on Democrats.
Cruz, who last week objected to the cost of the next package, said Sunday he is not on board with the measure from his fellow Senate Republicans.

"The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump, and they have cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is to shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America", he said.

AP blasts White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for "political" briefings - but reporters keep asking political questions - RT USA News

Trump tweeted that morning that NASCAR's television ratings had been hurt by a false allegation of a hate crime against driver Bubba Wallace and by its decision to ban display of the Confederate flag at its events.

McEnany did not provide the answer reporters wanted - a sound bite that would hurt Trump - but she repeatedly responded by saying the president was not taking a position on the Confederate flag and that the essence of his message was that NASCAR fans were being wrongly portrayed as being racist.
AP said she sounded "exasperated" during the briefing. She sounded "exasperated" during the briefing.
The Associated Press' story echoed a Washington Post op-ed column earlier this month by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, who is also president of the White House Correspondents Association.
Karl argued, "denying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust".

A roast of former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents' dinner in April 2018 was so vicious that even MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski called it "deplorable".

Fox News political analyst Brit Hume, a veteran of more than 50 years in journalism who had a 1989-1996 stint as ABC's chief White House correspondent, said reporters today display "aggressive behavior" in the briefing room because of their contempt for Trump.

Pogba has a year to run on his existing contract, although the club can extend that by 12 months meaning he actually has two years to run.

"I think it has probably missed the mark where all the people who call us, call in the expectation they can get very cheap funding rather than the government backing 50 percent of the loan", he said.
"So they call and they get very disappointed because the expectation has been put out there that there is discounting and we look at our cost of funding which hasn't changed at all".

"It's been a bit of a Catch 22 the major banks have got access to the lower cost funding but they are more risk averse so they don't actually go out to lend in the same way, they can't get access to the data and they can't get comfortable unless you have property", he said."Until we can access that cheaper funding I think there's a fiction out in the market on how popular the scheme is going to be".""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas questioned on Sunday President Trump's motives for sending federal agents into US cities - saying that while he would welcome the help in solving a slew of murders in the Midwestern city, he thinks the move could be more about boosting Trump's reelection chances.
"I was pretty frustrated this week [that] the president mentioned the George Floyd protests, mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement", Lucas, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday" of the recent protests over racial inequality and police brutality.
"Kansas City is not like that. We've had year-over-year increases [but] what we need help on is actually clearing some of the unresolved murders".
