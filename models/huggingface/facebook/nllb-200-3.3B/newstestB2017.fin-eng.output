A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says that he did not know of anyone who wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally gotten his affairs in order".
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco man Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office.
The San Francisco Police Department is investigating the death as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio in San Francisco that Frank, who had worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he was hired as the head chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that the death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small, close-knit team, like a family, and our grief is great", says the spokesman.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends".
Louis Galicia says Frank initially lived in a hostel, but he had finally gotten his act together.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who would want to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and generous.
Her way of being with the family was to cook for all of us", says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
"Despite all the injustices in the world, she was a diamond in the rough that shines every day", he says.
Anyone with any information on this case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at the following number: 415-575-4444.
Striking junior doctors are demanding new work strike measures
The representatives of the British junior doctors (who are mainly represented by the specialized doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new work-related measures in a dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors' Committee (JDC), part of the British Medical Association (BMA), is calling on the whole of the government to support the extra-curricular activities from the beginning of September.
The JDC claims that the ministers have not resolved the problems with the agreement.
The junior doctors and medical students rejected the BMA deal in a vote in July.
Of the members who took part in the vote, 58% rejected the agreement.
The JDC's chairman, Ellen McCourt, tweeted Thursday night a letter to JDC members in which she said the government had "kept on insisting" on the issues that led to McCourt's rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the new draft treaty in its entirety and demands that all our concerns be renegotiated formally.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today submitted a formal request to the BMA board, asking for permission for a gradual expansion of labor strikes beginning in mid-September".
The dispute has already led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first full-scale work stoppages in the history of Britain's public health system.
The director of junior doctors at the BMA, Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'commercial' in the definition of the term 'commercial'.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally end eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin met his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara was more eager to reconcile.
The parties did shake hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he barely even gave off any heat with his own restrained measuring stick.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin  according to one report, five times.
I didn't keep track of my own.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be restored to an even better state than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I perceived her enthusiasm in the opposite way.
But the continued coolness of the Putin show that the Russian capital has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin has attacked Ankara in the strongest terms, accusing her of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Regaining true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, though, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of it all.
The most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in Isis-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the allegations.
But the official message from Pieter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only arranged so that Putin would get the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
This may have been a victory for Russia.
The benefits of a truce for Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after being nearly removed from power in a failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic element to the settlement.
The Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the ban on charter flights, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The numbers have collapsed by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely sigh with relief when air traffic can finally resume.
They put their faith in the late Song's rush to the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a drop in the price of fruits and vegetables as Turkey's agricultural imports were allowed to resume.
"You went there, the tomatoes came back", was the wording of an article in the business magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Turkey is angry with the West because it believes that the West reacted violently to the attempted coup.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations with Turkey, and has been a key player in the negotiations with Turkey, and has been a key player in the negotiations with Turkey.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara for expressing support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own hidden concerns about the transition.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, in a summit meeting in a palace on the sea, could convey what one analyst described as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West are joining forces.
Despite the public reconciliation, the two continue to have major differences.
Most notable is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.
It is telling that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The Turkish president refused to answer the question about the differences between the countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they can seek to reach a consensus in Syria.
Given the potential for total catastrophe that NATO member Turkey caused by shooting down a Russian fighter jet, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are at least back in touch.
Royal Bank of Scotland loses customers outside Scotland
The Commission has also received comments from the Bank of England and the Bank of England on the restructuring plan submitted by the Bank of England and the Bank of England.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank's global objectives.
The bank was forced to backtrack on its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds in international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's been seen as right to let more national brands into the front.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not use the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWeste, except for the head office and the listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, other smaller private banking brands will gain greater prominence, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and the one that our staff are in, because we are now becoming much more of a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, so RBS became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something very different in its own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands".
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of various brands in its sponsorship of the sport.
"Now is the right time to become a multi-brand bank, because the real question is how we can make the bank better for the customers", says the bank's CEO.
"Three years ago, it would have been very smart to say that we are going to be an excellent bank for our customers and to introduce the brands.
But the work we've done, and the focus on our customers' needs instead of our own, has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's the right time".
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory at Newmarket and reached his 3,000th victory.
Dettori sipping champagne after winning two consecutive Newmarket races, which earned him 3,000 points.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by riding his horse Predilection to two victories on the same night at the track in his home town.
Dettori, 45, from Italy, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in flat-track racing.
He has been joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
I'm feeling very emotional because my family is here, too.
I'm very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The race is not a big event, not Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night with a crowd of 20,000.
I am relieved and humbled".
Dettori receiving cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the pinnacle of steeplechasing, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won a record-breaking career of over 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner of the Derby, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it is no surprise that he has just reached this milestone that few have ever reached.
He's elegant and strong, but it's his tactical ingenuity that sets him apart.
He is a fantastic representative of the sport of horse racing, and his passion and toughness have brought supporters to the sport over the years".
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he hadn't raced only on weekends and only in the big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding record at the British Grand Prix has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been a great thing to watch.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he's an incredible jockey".
Frankie Dettori celebrated his achievement in a signature way by leaping down from the back of his horse.
"From flying finishes to flamboyant downhill finishes, Frankie Dettori has been the model icon of British racing for two decades.
It's been a long journey, up and down.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996's "Magnificent Seven", but has also survived a plane crash and been banned from competition for misuse of drugs.
When the ban was lifted three years ago, he had a hard start, but he showed admirable character, showed his doubters and returned to his best.
And he's not about to retire anytime soon. Dettori recently said he wants to race until he's at least 50".
Putin fired his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as special representative for environment and transport.
According to a statement from the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but the reasons for the dismissal were not given.
He was appointed to the post by Anton Vaino, Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the President's Protocol Department and the Cabinet Office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
Mr Vaino thanked Mr Putin for his appointment, saying: 'I am grateful for your confidence.
I think the most important function of the administration is to support your work as head of state, which means drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented".
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended Vago as his successor.
Are you smiling for real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been a member of Vladimir Putin's inner circle and, like Putin, has a KGB background.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, both of whom were shown on Russian state television, they said that Ivanov was resigning at his own request.
Despite the smiles on camera, few people are convinced by the explanations, especially during the parliamentary elections.
Are the firings the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that the man who is being hailed as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website quotes Ivanov's words to Putin, saying: "It was right that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to put me in charge of this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have served as the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months".
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation and, like Mr Putin, a former member of the KGB, the State Security Service.
When Putin was head of the FSB, the successor to the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin took office, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
At the time, it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian president after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from running for a third term.
But the task was given to another man close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, then returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
"Criminal Minds" star Thomas Gibson was fired after beating up a producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent altercation on a film set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, the producers of the show, announced the firing in a joint press release.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, had issued a formal apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened", he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the FBI agents in the next series will be released at a later date, according to a press release from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, 54, previously starred on the comedy series Dharma & Greg, and has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
"I was hoping to see the series through, but that's not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could have ever hoped for".
The series' 12th season will begin in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious landing of fish in the garden of Banff
Kevin Bain, a resident of Banff, has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind-blown fish that were sucked ashore by a hurricane.
Mr. Bain, who lives about a half mile from the coast, posted the vision on Periscope, hoping to find an answer to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
The Queensferry Crossing is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the Queensferry overpass to the northbound bridge and the overpass, meaning that the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of four sections in the series of "archs" that are now nearly complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 screed-liners.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land bridge.
"This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing", says Brown.
We are all witnessing a truly remarkable development in the construction of the bridge, with over 30,000 pieces of concrete and steel used to build this section alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete sheath in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place".
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the initial bridge section is always a major milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the pinnacle of road and water engineering.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the North Tower pylon road, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e., ground) gap.
This was done by drawing the northern land mass 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and highly precise operation.
Massive, because the land bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be hauled up at an angle of about 3 percent.
And it was very precise, because the tolerances that the team had to work with were very small - just a few millimetres.
Thankfully, everything went well".
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Center reports the miraculous rescue of three men.
Three men who were drowned in their fishing boat off Anglesey were saved as if by a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station was alerted on Friday at 1.20pm local time to the presence of the crew of a vessel in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued its unassuming course without a rudder.
"We saw the boat go right next to them and imagined the worst", says Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfren lifeboat.
"By the time we reached the water, the strong winds had fortunately driven the boat away from them".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy and without a lifejacket.
They were all taken aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It is a miracle that these three men who were near the water are still alive and in perfect health.
The boat's engine had a first-aid cord, but for some reason it had detached from the man who was driving the boat when it fell.
They had a real good luck on the trip".
Pokémon Go is a game of health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
In the past decade, many have lamented why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at the screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and into the action.
At first, the screen was only used for watching television, then came video games, and most recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outer space are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go illusion, a game application whose characters are derived from video games created in the 1990s (and later used in animated series, card games and related products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this one also went on hiatus before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to the huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as popular as Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out to look for Pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked by GPS, and when the Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the screen of the phone) or "captured".
Villitys has taken on a generation of younger gamers and pulled their butts off the couch.
In the United States, gambling has dramatically increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardiogram app on the Apple Watch, which found that within two days of launching the game, the number of people who exercise 30 minutes a day suddenly went from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know which users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees raw data on activity rates.
Many public health campaigns, encouraging people to get off the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been dull and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regular exercise reduces the likelihood of cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a host of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health-promoting attitudes: exercise, fresh air, sunshine and joy.
During the yacht, it's possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon includes the angry whimsical moments.
And yes, someone can walk into a door while playing.
What about it?
The slip is made.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit may have been tracking your activity before, they didn't give you a reason to get out there like Pokémon Go does.
The appeal of novelty fades, and use diminishes over time.
But the success of Pokemon is going to lead to more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, which increases the mobility of people going out to hunt and improves their fitness and health.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's team all-around.
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic jumps.
I'm not worried about the booms.
You're going to be a little bit of a shaky perm.
Great at everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American fencer won the mixed martial arts championship on Thursday, raising the bar between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Her total of 62.198 points was clearly better than silver-placed Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will be performing with her pole in the women's individual all-around final of the women's pole vault competition on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row and the fifth woman ever to win the mixed doubles title, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, if not the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final total points came into view and his long journey to this moment came to an end.
An achievement that will take the sport to a whole new level and put him on a par with other superstars in the sport, including Michael Phelps:
Biles has been the absolute heavyweight of the sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championships, 10 of them gold, and earning them with such an ambitious and precise program that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest strength-trainer of all time".
In Brazil, there was one last race left, one that was fought primarily between Biles and himself and the burden of exaggerated expectations, not between Biles and the rest of the world.
Coming home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States after winning gold and silver in the women's individual medley final on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday as a point-over-i coordinator for the national team and now retired Martha Karoly's farewell.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought anything ahead during his long stay on top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program , which contains his waltz series , known as his power card, is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside Rio's Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
She was adopted by her grandparents at a young age and was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman, who found the girl while she was on a daycare visit to the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He hasn't lost a multi-sports match since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Despite the fact that Mustafina had a small lead with two laps, it was like a thrashing.
All that was left was the puom and the perm, in which Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead with 15,433 points from the field and crowned the final score with 15,933 points from the pen.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final scores - which was merely a formality - and tears began to appear around Biles's glittering red, white and blue border colour as the dream she once wrote in her scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor revenge for the four-year-old event, when he first shared third place but then lost to bronze medalist Mustafina in the repechage round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call the "mommy" of the team, was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flyers to the audience after his permanto program and thus rose from the losing position to the winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for the Bils, this 19-year-old's widely-publicized tweet earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police say a man who was listening to three songs in a car was killed by a serial killer.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the deadliest mass shooting in Phoenix in 10 years, as the victims sat in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police report released Thursday.
Authorities say that on June 12th, a car parked on the side of the road was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Maleah.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another vehicle, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple homicide was not the result of a robbery because the assailant did not take the purses or the $2,900 found in the possession of the other adult victim.
A spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the deaths are connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in predominantly Latin American neighborhoods in four months.
"The common thread in the incidents is that they have occurred in residential areas in front of homes", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to be in a number of vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators are reluctant to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that they were carried out by the same person.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah were killed instantly at the scene.
A witness told police that the three of them had often sat in the car listening to music.
Police also issued a statement saying that the shooting of an empty van occurred only 30 minutes before the triple incident, and that the shooter in both cases is believed to be the same man.
The investigators found the holsters and took a bullet from the car seat and a fragment from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto enjoys singing, playing with toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other children his age, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small-headedness, due to a genetic disorder in his mother, Elizabeth Picciutto, of which he was unaware while pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was, "I'm not gonna make it.
I can't do this.
I'm not committed to this.
Which is not true at all  of course you are committed to it", he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors even went so far as to recommend that the child be institutionalized.
"My initial reaction was that I didn't believe that such a practice existed anymore", says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund didn't sit up and start talking until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He's walking with assistance and riding a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of sign language, by which he means "sing to me".
"We're going to teach him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it does not mean just ordinary sign language. It includes the ones invented by Edmund himself.
A number of conditions can be the cause of microcephaly, including hereditary ones, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
There's a lot of variation in symptoms and prognosis.
It is too early to estimate how it will affect the lives of people with Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional turmoil caused by an uncertain future.
"I'm always wondering what will become of us,
"What will become of us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time because I don't think anyone can give it".
But Picciutò has some hopeful advice for mothers whose children have Zika-related birth defects.
"Things are going to get better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you".
Heavy rains and flooding have led to massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi.
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency Friday in response to heavy rainfall and widespread flooding, with more rain expected in the state through Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are flooding their banks and spreading over a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already on its way to the flooded areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office of national security and emergency preparedness, says the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, tens of thousands of sandbags have been requested by Tangipahoa County alone.
A flood warning will remain in effect through Saturday for most of south Louisiana.
The weather service has issued a warning that another 76 to 127 millimeters of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued for southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record highs.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann says that many homes on the riverbanks may be flooded in the Baton Rouge suburbs.
He also says that downstream flooding in Ascension County is a threat, since the flooded rivers are slowly draining into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River was already higher than ever at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue efforts continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier Friday near Gloucester among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet [120 m] from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He had been warned by his other half, who lived nearby.
"We got up, and the water came in a steady stream", says Hansford.
"It reached my waist".
The wife had told Hansford that in the 48 years that she had lived in the area, she had never seen the river rise to such a height.
Hansford says that he and his family have all had injuries, and he is the only one of them who can swim.
Rescuers had rescued all three in a large army-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltered on Friday.
Weatherman Krautmann says flooding will spread quickly and widely as the heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports that an observer near Livingston reported nearly two inches [350 mm] of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has been wet since the rains that started on Wednesday.
Officials say that heavy rains and flooding of streets forced residents of Tangipahoa County to evacuate their homes and forced school cancellations in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a CBS affiliate, that 200 homes were under flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now both have been flooded.
District manager Robby Miller says authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped by the flood.
Evacuees have been granted safe havens in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to recede", he says.
In the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, nearly two dozen streets were closed because of the flood, and residents were given sandbags to try to keep water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a major flood was in March", says city council member Lacy Landrum.
"This flood seems to be matching".
"In Mississippi, rainfall continued steady on the Gulf Coast", says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director for Harrison County.
Lacy says that Thursday there were reports of a handful of houses being flooded, but as of Friday, none had been reported.
Keith Townson, the store manager for Shopper Value Foods, says he's lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and more and more of it all the time".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown , who was shot multiple times , is surviving the shooting in Philadelphia .
Police in Philadelphia have confirmed the shooting of a 6-year-old boy, the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when taken to the hospital.
"He was hit a lot, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television network.
"I can't believe this is real".
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has had several surgeries.
The family tells the network that they believe the boy will survive.
He was about to start his first year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another, 29, was declared critical and two others were stable, reports CBS Philadelphia.
The television company said the child was found in the front seat of the car, alongside a 29-year-old woman in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was full of assault-type shells, derived from various assault weapons.
"It is perfectly clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the street.
There have been several armed fighters on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told a television station.
Bullets also hit many homes and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and word is that the police are going through the surveillance footage.
The second shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was struck in the arm by a stray bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's Olympic weightlifting team, and there's more than one reason for that.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as dominant as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many girls of color.
The team's lineup, complete with Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the last four years, the top female wrestler has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked number one and two.
This is so awesome.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible feats of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and their surprising and masterful rear-strike programs.
Simon became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's singles event on Thursday.
And team-mate Aly Raisman won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but they're not the same in teleportation hours across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed in the footsteps of Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the Final Five, for the next Olympic team will be only four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts mainly train in private gymnastics clubs run by their parents, who pay for the training costs, facilities, travel, appearance fees, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members, etc.).
Most of the facilities of the local youth associations are located in affluent residential areas, which are able to support the activities.
The training of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have both coached enthusiasts of the sport since they began telinearling.
We need to provide more affordable and accessible physical education for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own charity 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have provided free or low-cost opportunities for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) to participate in the sport of fencing, and some of these youth have gone on to national and international championships.
In September, we're expanding into my hometown of Detroit to provide a high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality boxing match for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Wrestling develops strength, agility, and coordination of the body and teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to start teller school, and it's just awesome.
Participating in sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true "girl power" you showed by winning Olympic gold, and for inspiring so many young girls from all backgrounds to start their path to be healthy, strong, successful young women.
The junior doctors have rejected Jeremy Hunt 's proposal and are preparing for another strike .
The Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes in pay and conditions of work by agreeing to a revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), the trade union representing doctors, but of the 37,000 junior doctors or 58% of the medical specialists who voted, the proposal was rejected.
In July, Health Secretary Hunt announced plans to force a deal, saying Britain's public health system (NHS) was "in no man's land" and that any further delays would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working practices, to improve healthcare during non-social times.
The chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, Ellen McCourt, issued a statement last night saying: 'Junior doctors remain highly wary of the proposed agreement, with a particular fear that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There's only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so we have to move on now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to talk and in some cases has not reacted in any way.
I did, despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, reverse the execution of the contract and address the concerns of the junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for new labor strikes".
The previous strike in late April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were called to support the striking doctors.
The Ministers hoped to settle the dispute over the amendments by concluding a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the deal.
The chief of staff for the NHS, Daniel Mortimer, appealed to junior doctors not to strike again.
"Working groups achieve very little or nothing", says Mortimer, "but they put pressure on already marginal groups and services, and cause anxiety, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families.
We have spent the last two months in consultation with the Junior Physician Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have taken a positive view of their concerns about the role of the monitor and the disclosure of malpractice.
Employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other key issues - such as development, training flexibility, retraining, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, apprenticeships and gender pay gap in health care - was a sign of the seriousness with which the employees, Health Education England, the health education authority and the Department of Health, wanted to stick to the agreements reached with the BMA in March and May".
A medicine that costs about $1.25 a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to get their hands on a drug that costs about €2.40 a day, after authorities recommended that it be given to more people and used for longer.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is currently given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), part of the UK' s National Health Service (NHS), which is responsible for assessing the introduction of new treatments, has recommended that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even further.
But the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), now part of Britain's National Health Service (NHS) and evaluating the adoption of new treatments, has recommended that ticagrelor be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have a recurrence or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that accumulate in the walls of blood vessels, causing plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can form a clot that blocks blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a clot breaks, it can travel with the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a second heart attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
A British brand of the AstraZeneca brand, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of occurrence of seizures.
The NICE guideline published today recommends that tikagrelor be given first at 90 mg for 12 months, then reduced to 60 milligrams, and then given twice daily for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), says: "Despite the availability of effective treatment to prevent progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of heart attack victims will have a second attack or stroke - often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor, when combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor adds to the treatment options for the thousands of people who will benefit from it".
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor  particularly in relation to bleeding risk  are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend the use of the treatment regimen for longer than that.
The vote-rigging in Muslim areas has flourished because of the political correctness of the climate
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government to issue a report
A climate of political correctness has led to a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report released today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticised police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to the ballot box "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Pickles, a former regional government minister and now an anti-corruption powerhouse, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard lines outside polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present their identity card to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At this stage, the voter must simply state his name and address.
The report also suggests that fingers should be dipped in permanent ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
The Commission is also proposing that the EU should be able to take part in the negotiations with the countries of the region.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to fight corruption and fraud against financial interests and the culture that promotes them more widely in local governments", he says.
The British Prime Minister has asked for a briefing in East London after the Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ordered the then mayor Lutfur Rahman to be removed from office for corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "viciously distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and deflected his criticism by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use as a basis for his campaign the religious duty of every devout Muslim to vote for him".
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently cast by impersonating a person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the envelope on which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reportedly pressuring people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring ID at the polling station.
The report states: "There is evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and youth, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of their parents, particularly in communities with Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds".
"There was concern that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such activity because of the 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions for cleaning up the system, including banning political activists from processing postal voting tickets to prevent "votes being harvested".
The report now before the House also calls for stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider options that would require voters to present identification before voting.
Fingers in the ink after the vote so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to verify the nationality and voting rights of voters.
To set a limit of three years for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition on political activists handling completed voices and voicemail envelopes sent by post.
The right of the police to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to bring intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act, 1983, which extended the right to vote.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Allowing English only at polling stations (except in Wales).
Increase training to ensure that staff observe the rule that only one person may go to the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric is highly critical of the London police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The electoral court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices", he says.
"He was found guilty without a reasonable doubt and the criminal exhibition threshold was exceeded on many grounds".
He also criticised the ineffective 'screening' of the electoral lists in the city council departments.
"The court's decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call", says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and its prohibition practiced by some".
The resemblance of an Olympic cyclist to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers roaming the Rio Olympics
Rio 2016 fans went wild this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is staggering.
But social media chatter suggests that the 24-year-old Olympic champion is far from the only champion athlete with a likeness to a well-known figure.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the familiar faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic delegates whose obvious resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: Brady Ellison (left), a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine's twin seen on the bike trail, many people have noted on social media that a certain archer might be the twin brother of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. men's archery team has been rocked by Brady Ellison's Twitter post after images of him strikingly resembling a star from the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the social media phenomenon and admitted that he had heard since childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the similarity as being that great, except maybe the beard and the mustache", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment".
The 2012 London Games were highlighted by the resemblance of British long-distance runner Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will no doubt be highlighted even more in these Games.
The large-eyed Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the water, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user says that Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have powerful eyebrows and lips, has long been noted.
The silver medalist in swimming, Russia's Yulia Efimova, is reminiscent of actress Annalynne McCordia, not just for her beautifully tanned skin and fair hair, while U.S. team member Nathan Adrian is, according to fans, "an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their facial features and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the similarity.
This user is wondering if the resemblance of the pair is a good reason.
One tweet recently expressed his delight that "others on the internet agree on the similarity of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the Dexter actor are indeed strikingly similar in their facial features and eyes.
Many have also noted similarities in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the wide smiles of gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and movie star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4 x 200m freestyle relay stunned viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "got lost in the swamps" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Runner Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to vent his opinions on the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC news team bringing in color, was heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left in a hurry and died like a pig.
Thank you for that".
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg in a time of 1:57.79, missing Canada's Taylor Ruck by 1.61 seconds, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly, shocked by the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese girl died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet".
Described as a swimmer in the final of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle, Ai Yanhan of China said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl was a baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments critical of Byron MacDonald, with many calling for his dismissal.
The tweets were out of control when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis tweeted, "Wow, this is #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist bunch. #disapprove".
CBC host Scott Russell was quick to apologise for MacDonald's comments: "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened".
The CBC eventually had to apologize over 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
His co-anchor Scott Russell was forced to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
The CBC then copied and pasted its apologies to more than 90 other tweets complaining about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly issued a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and their appearance on the air.
On last night's show, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
"Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for what he said".
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his speech by saying that he didn't mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for my comment last night after the women's message", MacDonald said on the CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I meant no disrespect, and I am very sorry".
In Primark , a woman who negotiated in the middle of a store for unrestricted underwear shocked customers .
The customers didn't know where to look when she stripped in the middle of Primark to match her underwear.
He made matters worse by assessing how he looked in his underwear, removing it from his leg and putting it back on the shelf.
She kept going around and eventually tried four pairs of underpants at a store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, relates that after trying on some lingerie, the unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He relates what happened: "People could not believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own shirt and underwear and put them on.
He was not trying to do it without being noticed, but he was doing it without any shame.
Everyone watched as she took off the underwear she had tried on, and apparently did not like them because she put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn't like any of them, he got dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks  or think about the person who would eventually buy the underpants he had tried on".
Davidson, 33, of Kent Town, adds: "It's disgusting to think of someone taking home underwear that someone else has worn and not washed".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff made efforts to remove the items in question from sale after the woman had left - which is correct.
It would be a terrible thing to take home new underwear and find that someone else has tried them on without washing them", adds Davidson.
A spokesman for Primark commented: "Primark is aware of the situation that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th at its Folkestonen store.
All the products concerned have been withdrawn from sale.'
So you defend against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little bit safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, a New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga movement, for advice on how to deal with a robber or a bully who waved a gun at close range.
The video shows how to defend yourself against an attacker depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or from the back.
If an attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and get out of the line of fire, says Mizrachi.
Then, grab the weapon so that it is between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker in the knees, and when he goes into double pain, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and back off with the gun pointed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed assailant is approaching from the front, you have to move away from the ammunition line, grab the weapon, and deflect it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the weapon and strike the attacker with your fist at the chest, turn the weapon away from the attacker's grip, back off, and hold the weapon pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound like a problem?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of a robber is to give up your cash. Unless you're a grand master of Krav Maga.
Ian Wright , a world traveler who 's a travel guide , is sucking on the dirtiest places in Europe .
The British world traveler put his endurance and his twin reflexes to the test by licking Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Ian Wright, 51, a presenter and travel guide writer from Suffolk, wanted to prove his resilience by licking a euro banknote, a cuff on Piccadilly Circus, a train flusher button and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the audience what he was putting his tongue in.
The experiment was made into a documentary film by Ian Wright, and the results were surprising.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train may be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his travels through Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the benefits of good gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel show, where he tested his gut's endurance by traveling the world and eating strange and miraculous things.
The railway station handrails and the licking of the toilet flush button no doubt challenged Wright's resilience.
In the documentary, Wright says: "Ever since I was a child, I have been quite careless about my health and have stuffed my mouth with everything from mud, worms and water".
In the movie, he really lived up to his reputation.
The only place I met Raja was in a filthy public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured over 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, freshly washed hands usually have less than 60.
The border was met in the Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer read 4,000 units, and in the hands of the newly-washed, the same number is less than 60.
Wright is seen in the documentary Ian Wright  Inner Power, co-produced with Valio, which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the document, Wright says: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in a toilet.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
It's so disgusting, I'm not going to lick anything".
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright  In Search of the Force in collaboration with Valio.
Valio gave Wright lactic acid bacteria and Valio Gefilus, which contains vitamins C and D and helps to strengthen the gut's good bacterial defence and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the snacks, juices and fresh products category at Valio, says: 'We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's interesting to look at and also tells you about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time coming up with crazy ideas, and finally we came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along".
Gut health has become a worldwide trend.
"Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to immunity.
Gut health has become a global trend, and with this documentary, we can give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!"
The film's director, Tom Hakala, adds: "Let's put it this way, I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is also shown in the film.
Naturally, some of the objects were easier for Ian to lick, while others were quite bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty bitches on tape".
In the 2015 Valio survey, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with gut health in particular and 58% reported at least occasional use of products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
The family of the bully destroyed, before they were evicted, a city-owned rental property in Saltash, Cornwall
The Wicked Family left £50,000 worth of damage to a city-owned rental property after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their flat in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple were forcibly removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company were shocked to find that the apartment was in a state of disrepair.
There were gaping holes in the walls, the floorboards had been torn off, the trash was spread on the floors, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The couple has now moved in, and they are believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the house may not be salvageable.
He says: "This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, and no one should have to put up with this.
There's a lot to weigh here, as the property is likely to become known as a less than pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, as its name suggests".
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment on and off, and police said the family's terrorism included street fights at baseball fields, intimidation of close friends, use and distribution of drugs, and loud shouting, arguments, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, who signed the lease, was issued an anti-social behaviour order in June.
In several rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old debris was found.
The house had been a drug store before, and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and the police were called in regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Authority evicted the couple this week after giving them an 11-week extension to voluntarily move out.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction - they said their life had been hell on earth.
Says one neighbor: "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and it has been a difficult time.
The police have been here an unbelievable number of times".
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It's going to be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted".
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of enforcement at the Cornwall Housing Authority, says the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Trash and old toys were thrown onto the leafy wall of a rental home.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own conduct and that of his family, for eviction is always the last measure considered by the Cornwall Housing Board.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my task force, the Devon and Cornwall Police and to the members of the community who have been involved and have courageously offered to give us information.
I hope this progress will improve the well-being of the neighbors and send a message that antisocial behavior is not acceptable".
Fitzpatrick says the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after the home was vacated.
The housekeepers now have to clean out the garbage dumps around the house.
Police raided the flat in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with intent to sell.
He claimed the money was for the headstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband are said to have moved to a private home in Plymouth.
Many rooms had graffiti on the walls.
The police say they're going to demand eviction of tenants who violate the rules of the lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction will serve as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they please without being charged, as well as to those who suffer from such behaviour", says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never condone criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying military jet that crashed into a beach in Portugal frightened tourists
Sun-worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal, were shocked by the events of their lives.
A P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force plunged to a staggering depth.
The Air Force has confirmed that this was a training flight and that there was no threat to safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicked as a low-flying jet plunged over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows an army plane coming within a few feet of sunbathing tourists on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up, understandably concerned about the roar of the jet engines that began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the holidaymakers who posted photos and videos of the dramatic glide on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a really low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the machine would fall on me".
Tourists on the Aveiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a shockingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force has today reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which is why the plane had to be flown so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly at a slightly normal low altitude because of the smoke from nearby forest fires, which impeded visibility, but according to the air force, this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exot's first half result better than expected
South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) exceeded its planned result by EUR 3.4 million in January-June.
Export earnings were EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The results were particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has helped to decongest the institution.
The guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote is looking to shorten the number of operations.
The exotic reserve covers the deficit previously incurred by the surplus.
The excess may be used to cut down on the queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is forecast to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exotic Board will be discussing the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Forces soldiers took the oath of military service in Immola.
Seventy members of the U.S. Coast Guard and Border Patrol were sworn in Friday.
A military ceremony for the cadets of the Border and Marine School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Forces Medical Corps was inaugurated at the garrison's sports field.
The oath of allegiance was taken by 70 men of the armed forces.
Special Forces are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat duties.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young men applied for the Special Forces.
Of these, 250 were invited to auditions.
Special icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans' meeting, held in conjunction with the ceremony, included five wartime veterans of the border troops.
The average age of those who were on board is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans to attend the event were born in 1918.
The district's equivalent of a robbery in advance - Crime Intelligence helps to solve crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has had a RTA, or Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The police department in Hämeenlinna has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being led by a sergeant stationed in the Gulf.
The chief executive of the Gulf is the Commissioner.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a dedicated civilian IT staff in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in plainclothes.
The unit has proved its usefulness and its necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different reports for the other police.
In the case of the applicant, the Commission has not provided any information on the number of asylum seekers in the host Member State.
The reform of modern working methods
The creation of the analysis units is a recent reform of the way police work.
The aim has been to prevent crime, so that the police will be less and less likely to go to the scene of a violent crime only when they are alerted.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will be used to direct day-to-day police activities to where they are needed most.
The reform of the police administration resulted in the establishment of one Criminal Intelligence Centre, three national units and a Criminal Intelligence Unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which is part of the Vantaa Central Criminal Police, is responsible for the national operation.
As the name suggests, the PTR units are staffed by police, customs and border guards.
RTAs, in turn, work in areas allocated to the police authorities and are responsible for providing information to both local and national police forces.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory.
Whereas an individual policeman is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is responsible for knowing what is happening in the entire police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of your own facility, because that's what crime does.
The people who work in the RTA have better computer skills than the regular police.
The unit uses registers, the alert database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive crimes or similar crimes.
This is called sarcasm, and it's one of the most important tools in criminal investigation.
Every man has his own way of doing things.
The handprint is also seen in work, whether honest or criminal.
The way you do things, it gives you a certain image of the person.
Classification can be done either by the act or by the person, depending on which the police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The RTA staff do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not completely public either.
It is as if the methods used by criminals are not disclosed, because this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to impede police efforts to combat crime.
The police shall publicly disclose the methods if they foresee a threat.
For example, in the early summer of 2001, a news story was the marking of empty apartments in a housing collapse.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin, or a piece of tape on the outside of the apartment door to test whether the occupants were actually traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be publicly available to at least the interested parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most important of these is the ordering of a court record, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time we steal, we'll leave with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä Häme, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa of the East Finland Police, Crime Commissioner Sami Joutjärve of the Joensuu Police Station and Crime Inspector Arto Tuomelaa of the Central Crime Police.
Police gather and analyze information to plan practical action.
The background is the reduction in manpower and funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation involves collecting information from outside the institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl from London who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria.
The news is that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that the sultan died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, was planning to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that this serves as a warning example and a testament to people to understand that this is a real risk when going into a war zone - and one that makes people give up the decision to leave", Akunjee says.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a flight to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that the sultan had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's nomination after Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who will fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicts Clinton will pick Garland "with a fair degree of certainty".
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether he would name Garland.
Reid praised Garland, saying the Clinton team wouldn't want to "swing the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid says the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "collaborators" and "advisors" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are as much a part of women's lives as they are of men's.
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to launch a Pirelli-inspired calendar in the style of the 1970s for 2017.
Instead of celebrity models, they want to find the next generation of supermodels for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his strip-seeking magazine differs from the old-school Playboy magazine in that, according to him, "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women".
I'm sure he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity, where women, as well as men, can freely enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body", says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure the women will want to be part of this project, because it's going to be a beautiful piece of art".
Those who want to be models for the calendar can submit their pictures online or participate in open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
The appeal of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write your angry protest in the comment section under the heading NotEveryoneAndSinglesMid-AgedMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the research company YouGov, the much-hyped new vinyl album is not the result of a millennial-generation boom, where millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but rather a nostalgia for middle age.
The most likely age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely buyer.
It is also not just about the desire of the fans to pick up the records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions in check (56 per cent vs 53 per cent) and enjoy being alone (69 per cent vs 66 per cent).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked down the busy Soho Street in my plain gray suit, and I would be so excited, I would bend my arms in a cup and say something traditional like, "Let's find out".
So let's find out for ourselves.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rosy appearance as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase have taken over the formerly privately owned premises, a handful of specialist record shops still remain.
I would probably ask the cameraman to pause the camera for a moment while I get very close to the men who visit these stores and try to gauge their age and temperament by observation.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is on a full-time afternoon in London, spending his spare time exploring the shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess so", he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records".
These plates fill the wall of his living room, as you can see in the photo (Stuart e-mailed me the picture, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he's gotten so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which allows him to buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out, and buy back things he was forced to sell when he was young and broke.
"I miss a lot of the late '60s and early '70s stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them", he says.
He agrees that vinyl record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my evil".
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has observed a new stream of people affected by media hypocrisy, who have heard of the return of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"From the discussions I had, people had generally given up their collections by around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back", he says.
This may explain the boom in vinyl-dominated music at a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the soundtracks?
It takes a few seconds to realize that in a business like Phonican, they provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have become particularly resentful of contactless payment systems.
The digital world may be a bit of a trap for some vinyl fans, for whom returning to the familiar disc box is a permanent fix and a reminder of the happy days of their youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a void or provides some sort of comfort in acquiring material possessions", says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe many others have, too.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things".
"We're like social workers!" exclaims a fellow worker of Wez from behind the counter.
An ICM opinion poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who had bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also revealed that 41 percent have a record player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers do not have a record player of their own.
At this point in the news, I'd probably be looking like a serious face while browsing through a collection of pinol bossa nova.
The new vinyl record is also associated with a "cup phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman for the Sounds of the Universe movement (with three middle-aged men as customers at the time).
"A customer came into the store recently and said he didn't have a record player, but he wanted to buy a Radiohead record so he could put it on his shelf", says Jonny.
"The proportion of such customers is not large, but they are there.
They're more interested in the material than the music.
Some of our customers tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just beginning the hobby".
The customer base is much more diverse at Fopp, which I'll be getting to next, and the business has a whole floor devoted to vinyl records.
Our clients are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of the customers is a delight, though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous moves: instead of jazz with loudspeakers, the latest sex-themed synthesizer rap from Wild Beast.
None of our clients seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to detect a searing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various discs in the lower level.
He's more interested in watching than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or otherwise, but the subtlety of vinyl is"... he sighs with delight and continues:
"I can't explain it, they're so unique".
My final stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine themselves hyping up jeans, but instead they're huddling around Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary and classical music, the key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the walls, perhaps because they're just a piece of furniture and part of the wall so high that you can't even get to it.
They're made from pure art vinyl.
But considering that any way to get attention for these discs could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients on a scouting trip to Soho, there's little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the demographic group most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group most likely to spend the most on luxuries like vinyl records.
So, while my research shows that YouGov's findings are true, at least in the Soho record store, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or in the workplace.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings slinking around Berwick Street record shops, browsing through records, and avoiding the 30-year-old who plays a TV host, who stares at and glares at unsympathetically middle-aged men.
The holker, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate  Video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is the ice shark.
According to archaeologist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark ever recorded in the study was a five-meter-long female, 272 years old.
French court rejects application for closure of forestry company
The French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in a jungle camp populated by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp, which sell a variety of goods to residents, from tobacco to energy drinks to haircuts.
The authorities in Calais have called for the closure of these shops and restaurants, because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a 'grey economy' and because they pose fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, since the free meals provided by the state-supported organization and others are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 temporary shopkeepers, but found the prefect of Calais' concerns "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Mollan, the camp's grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants are of far greater importance than simply providing food for people "living in extremely precarious conditions".
He says they provide quiet places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the sites under demolition was the Jungle Book Kids Café at the camp, a non-profit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and shelter counseling to the hundreds of unaccompanied minors at the camp who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an appeal to preserve the children's cafe.
According to a letter to the Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that following a surge of summer arrivals, the population of the Viincoleri has risen to a record high of over 9,000.
Food prices fall much faster in Finland than in the EU average
Food is being depleted in Finland, to the delight of consumers and the displeasure of producers.
The price of food has fallen in Finland by almost 5% in three years, compared with an average of 0.9% in the EU.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
In the last three years, food prices in Finland have fallen the second most among EU countries with a wage level similar to Finland's.
Of the comparative countries, only in Britain has the price of food fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are taken from an article by Statistics Finland's Head of Development Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The price comparison is based on real prices, i.e. prices that are correlated with the general trend in consumer prices.
The most recent data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell to near the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership brought", says Lehtinen.
Then came a twist, and the food has become less and less good year after year.
Now the price is weighed down by the Russian ban on food imports, which has halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The price decline has also been influenced by increased price competition in industry and trade.
The big retail chains S Group and Kesko have both cut their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has taken the form of a showy advertising campaign.
Nevertheless, Finland is still not a glutton for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen sharply.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive food in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the same VAT rate were applied in the other countries, Finland would be the third cheapest food market in the world.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the other countries were 7, only Germans and Dutchmen would sell food cheaper than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we must halve the VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue price competition", writes Lehtinen.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made in the VAT rate are indicative.
School isn 't what it used to be .
Returning to school may find that during the summer there has been a change in the school.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools and will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the term.
It is a guideline that is followed in all schools in Finland.
The schools will decide the details, but the plan will tell you the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
For example, the teaching of cursive will be abandoned, and instead coding will be taught in schools.
Swedish language is taught from the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are taught from the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of the pupils.
We used to think that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is an attempt to make education more interesting.
The world 's oldest known vertebrate has been found . A great ice shark can live up to 400 years .
The Greenland shark, also known as the ice shark, does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live for another 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic fly, whose oldest known specimen has been dated at 507 years.
The Greenland shark is swimming across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch the dogs longer, they can grow up to over five meters.
Because of the slow rate of growth, reported to be only about one inch [1.8 cm] a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified the lifespan of 28 adult female ice shark that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon test of the eye lens.
The average lifespan of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian shells, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old, respectively.
Since previous studies have shown that the ice-tailed macaws reach maturity at a length of only about four millimeters, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fires nearly 300 salespeople, but they're not cutting back.
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off at the department store company Stockmann.
The cooperative societies in the company, which was in difficulty, were closed at the beginning of August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, the majority of which will be carried out by means of redundancies", says Stockmann in a press release.
It says that the number of salesmen in the department stores will not be reduced to avoid a detriment to customer service.
In addition, some 80 support staff are being offered new jobs as sales staff.
Stockmann's consultations concerned some 3 000 employees.
At the time of the start of the restructuring, the number of employees to be reduced was estimated at approximately 380.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of some EUR 20 million, which are due to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme which is expected to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making a profit from the commodity trade.
Although the group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the merchandise business is still loss-making.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
The Commission considers that the restructuring plan is not sufficient to ensure the viability of the company.
The second quarter's improved earnings were mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter sales and earnings.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group recorded a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the group's turnover this year will be lower than last year.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the hottest day in the northern hemisphere with temperatures below 20 degrees across the country .
The low pressure center over northern Finland has declared Friday as a rainy day, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist with HS.
The central part of the country also gets rain, but the southern part is arid.
The temperature is not so summery anymore, since the mercury levels in the entire country are below 20 degrees Celsius.
In the northern rainy areas, it's 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya's national team is shaken by a doping scandal - a bizarre explanation for the coach's removal
Kenyan gymnastics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah posed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
Associated Press reports that the athlete Anzrah was trying to reach is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenyan national team manager Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
The doping agents went to Anzrah to inform the authorities.
According to Soin, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour", Kenya's Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics competition begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It's not yet known if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is already a favourite to win Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah used the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid of being exposed", the source said.
Where is everybody?
The stadium in Rio is empty
Where is everybody?
At least not in Rio's Olympic Stadium watching a sporting event.
On Friday, the competition for the medals of the world's most prestigious sports began in Rio, but the world's top athletes were allowed to show off their skills to a bewildering audience.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day's morning games and 65 percent for the evening games have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where a stadium was packed with cheering crowds.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rios.
The Olympic spectatorship in Rio has already attracted attention before the Games.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen at rugby, melon, and horseback riding.
When Brazil's Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seater arena was only about 30 percent full.
The poor attendance is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling financially, is far from European and Asian sports tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are foreign to football-addicted Brazilians.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian soccer team did not fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the race organisers, said at the weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold by then, a figure that was clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell", Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as those for Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not allowed yet because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not caught the attention of the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012 and won the gold medal in the same year.
We had enough people on the newsstands.
A new way to protect nature - get a claim on land
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, which was set up last year, is acquiring ecologically important nature areas.
After that, individuals, companies and communities can redeem their land tenure rights in cash.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is divided into virtual blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire it in return for a fee.
The holder has a veto over the 187 square blocks of land, which means that in practice, if the land is to be re-purposed, no approval is required from each holder.
The right to fish for more than one block may also be acquired.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something tangible that can be bequeathed or given as a gift.
There is no need to go out and carry banners or to tie yourself up somewhere to protect nature", explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has won the right to manage the site.
The user who has acquired the right to manage the block will be able to obtain precise location data on the block, which will allow, for example, to visit the block.
The Foundation's website displays the names of the holders of the rights in the same map as the land block data.
Leviäkangas sees the only risk in building a nature reserve is that the Foundation's activities change from their original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation established to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There's a risk that the foundation might act in some unethical or commercial way, but that shouldn't be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect natural areas in such a way that they can be left untouched and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or by donation.
It is financed mainly by the sale of holding rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The foundation's goal is to acquire more protected lands.
It is also aiming beyond Finland's borders and plans to import from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities at the pop up forest at Helsinki's shopping street from 13 to 19 August.
Cycle thieves are the worst offenders in big cities Turku - look at your home town
Of all the big cities in Finland, Turku is the one most frequently attacked by bicycle thieves.
More bicycles have been stolen there this year, relative to the population, than in nine other major cities.
Based on bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsinki Sanomat found out the number of bicycles and their parts stolen in the ten largest cities this year, per thousand inhabitants, from January to August.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were the top three cities.
Police reports indicate that there were between four and five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are twice as many burglaries as in others, in proportion to the number of inhabitants", says Police Commissioner Tommi Reen.
I'm surprised the police are wondering why this city is at the top of the list.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles are stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft may be affected by how much people cycle in the city and how many bicycles there are", reflects Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the head of the police administration, is very much looking forward to Turku, Helsinki and Oulu rising to the top of the list.
The rates of bicycle theft are largely determined by which are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances, and plenty of wheels for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, with city centres far apart and the bicycle not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
In January-August, the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police in Finland as a whole was slightly lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year.
But there's no reason to be happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
This means 50 to 60 bicycles a day and in Helsinki alone some 4 000 a year.
"It's a lot of money", Reen says.
In reality, the thieves steal more than the bicycles, since only a fraction of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bicycle theft, even though less than one in ten cases reported to the police ever go to trial.
A typical bike theft is one where the police are notified of the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases come up in other investigations, too, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught on a weekly basis, either for the crime or in the course of a police investigation, says senior constable Timo Leppämäki.
He says that bicycles are stolen from shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars, or virtually anywhere they are stored.
The most common type of individual bike theft is the Jopo, as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take a bicycle for short-term personal use, but a large proportion of the stolen bicycles end up for sale, for example, through the Internet.
They're for the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that the stolen bikes go abroad much", says Reen.
The buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns, according to the police.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some of us might have doubts.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, for he may be guilty of concealment or trespassing.
"Alarms should go off if a bike in good condition is being sold at a clear underprice", says Reen.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, carries his colorful Nopsa every day during his work at the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five of them, but none have been stolen, says Hirvi. "No one has ever stolen them, so he's a good monk".
"Maybe this is not so attractive to thieves, it may not have hipster value", says Hirvi from Helsinki.
In a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve, who had just arrived, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now, the wheel is bolted to the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike onto something solid, like a bicycle rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this is the most expensive thing I've ever owned", says a student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, which cost about $200 (U.S.) for the frame alone.
"I hear from my friends all the time that the wheels are gone".
"Mostly bad bikes, like those Rumple-Jops".
Valve himself had a bicycle stolen from the housing company's backyard a year ago.
But the bike was left unlocked, so Valve knew to expect it to be impounded.
You're saying that under 15s are not accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is testing its US-style equivalent
In Helsinki, an experiment is being carried out with a so-called peer-to-peer team to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
The experiment will initially be applied to those under 15 years of age, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
The first crime committed by a young man is being investigated by a peer review team.
The idea is that the peer review panel discusses the crime that occurred with the offender and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer review team to make amends for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in conjunction with each other.
"Everyone is trying to steer the youngster's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn't go to hell because of the first mistake", says Laitio.
The parallel fleet is modelled on the US, where it is widely used.
The idea is that rather than face an adult panel after a youth commits his first crime, he reflects on what happened with others of his own age.
The model has been tried once.
Palmo's service designer Iikka Lovio, who was monitoring the experiment, says that it was a case of assault, which was successfully solved.
Especially first offences committed by those under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message to continue on the path you have chosen", Lovio says.
The youth exchange team is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
The Commission is also proposing to make the EU's new rules more transparent and more effective.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding the Trump campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans have reportedly signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by Politico, a U.S. newspaper that had obtained a copy of the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter has been sent to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the divisions caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record unpopularity threaten to bring a vote-river to the Democrats in this election", the letter says, according to Politico.
Only by directing all possible resources immediately to the congressional elections can Republicans be kept from drowning in a Trump-like anchor around their neck.
The letter says that the decision should not be difficult, as the chances of Trump winning the presidential election decrease day by day.
Politico says the letter is due to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is a Republican who is very anti-Trump, Andrew Weinstein.
Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 former national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States .
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the American economy can be run well for all.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will go well for him and his cronies", Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases on the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a show of support for the American workers who suffered when the factories were moved to the low-wage labor countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a construction crew, we have to get back to building!
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the burden of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he said that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax evader, it has to pay exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"[As president] I will oppose any trade agreements that work against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
Speculation in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech suggested that Clinton was going to criticize the economic program unveiled by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "favoring only millionaires like this".
Clinton has previously called Trump's proposed sweeping corporate tax cut "Trump's loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton made it clear that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has defaulted on, and the clothing that Trump himself is manufacturing in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton mused.
The following are the numbers of viewers for Rio: The Finns have not been glued to the screen, but the mobile app is of interest
Sports shoes are usually seen in television viewership statistics as sharp mountaintops.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached huge audiences.
At one point, the Games have attracted the attention of at most 12% of the population: on Tuesday night, the swim was followed by 615,000 viewers on the YLE Olympic channel on TV2 at the same time.
By way of comparison, the European Championships in athletics a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Championships in football attracted well over a million viewers.
The Sunday evening cycling and the opening ceremony of the fifth day of the Games have been the most popular events of the Olympics, both attracting almost half a million viewers at one time.
The Commissioner for Sport, Panu Pokkinen, was pleased with the audience figures and recalled that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, the audience will be divided into several different media.
In addition to TV, the Finns follow the Olympic Games from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the fact that the Olympic Games are the first choice of television viewers.
In the television sector, viewers are divided between TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you're on the air 24 hours a day, and you're watching from 20,000 to 500,000 people, that's a good foundation.
The viewership is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts in Finland come at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone now considers it to be lax - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise medal in the preliminary round, the interest would have been boosted upwards with it.
In addition, general sports are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The ratings for the first season have been close to what we expected, according to Mr. Pokkine.
When the Open starts, the ratings will go through the roof.
Yle launched the mobile application Yle Rio 2016 for the Games, which became the most downloaded free application in Finland in the first days of the Games in Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're well on our way to 200,000 downloads.
"We will not know the number of viewers until later", Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not been performing as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has been received and the defect has been corrected.
The opening of the Rio Arena has been subject to delays and other minor technical problems in the initial phase.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen on the Yellen Canal and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some sports, and Yle Puhe broadcasts races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the busiest YLE ever, but also the last to be watched exclusively on YLE channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are shown on both the Yale and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 meters deep on the island of Ristinsaari.
It could be deeper than that.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters at Ristisel, with a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation with a sonar probe.
The method may not find a small hole at a depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now, the official depth is still 305 feet [95.3 m].
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
The main waterways are the Saimaa, Toisvesi and the Pääjärvi.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Spider.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been mapped thoroughly.
"There may well be unknown deep water", Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is defined by mean depth, it is the Great Lakes, 75 feet [23 m].
In this view, your planet is not in the top ten, and Suvasvesi is even further down the list.
August 12th, 14:29 pm: Fixed the last section where the deepest lakes were off-center.
The tax burden: taxation of pensioners to be tightened
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the issue came up during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equalised with that of employees.
The government's proposal doesn't include any of that.
We think it should definitely be there.
The EU must also be able to take action to ensure that the EU's citizens are not excluded from the EU.
Earlier this year, employees received a reduction in their working hours, which reduced their tax burden.
The issue was heated up in Parliament by the opposition, who blasted then Chancellor of the Exchequer Alexander Stubby (pictured) for his election promises.
The purchasing power is protected, it does not increase
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the task of drawing up a report on the situation in the EU.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment, if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The European Parliament has also called for the EU to be given a clear mandate to deal with the issue of the death penalty.
He says that keeping the agreement is crucial to credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government's term.
It is a fact that the social partners have done it, and it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It comes into play because the economy is so dependent on domestic demand and people's belief in their own future.
The longterm unemployment crisis
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'eco-friendly' in the definition of the term 'eco-friendly'.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was some 17 000 higher than a year earlier.
He says that unless growth is halted, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will be lost.
The Commission is also proposing that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to carcinogens.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks in Thailand
In Thailand, at least four people were killed in bombings last night and last night, in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finnish nationals to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
The EU's new law on the protection of the environment is designed to ensure that the EU's environmental legislation is not misused.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at present, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish season for travel to Thailand is the turn of the year.
Most of the tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to the Finnish people in Hua Hin in particular to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No record of the perpetrator
Westphalen says there's no word yet on who's behind the attacks.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to political unrest in a divided society in Thailand and last week's referendum on a constitution by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, the country arrested people who declared their opposition to the law.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the existing aid to the coal industry, which is already in the process of being phased out.
Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
But in the past, attacks have not been directed at tourist sites.
There's a big local celebration in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the town is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There's very little traffic in the city.
The impact of the attacks on the day is such that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from normal terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, according to the Thai police, according to the AP news agency.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in the past 24 hours as 11 bombs exploded in tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded overnight on the resort island of Phuket, a popular destination for Finns, reports the Bangkok Post of Thailand.
According to the current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded, according to the paper, on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ng, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
In the popular tourist resort of Hua Hin, local authorities say a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both twin bombings, at least one person was killed.
In addition, in the southern Thai town of Surat Thanh and the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
In each attack, at least one person was killed.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is the gateway to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the head of the military junta that rules Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was still unknown.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
"We should not be encouraging more panic", he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of security, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been intent on destroying the country's tourism industry, as all the attacks have been on tourist sites.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finnish citizens to be careful and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish people who are going to Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but should follow the instructions of the embassy on precautions, says Westphalen.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks and the victims of the night in Finland.
We've had a little more time to learn about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
The incident killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In the second attack by Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded near a famous tourist attraction, the Clock Tower.
PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin, Thailand, where they believe they have found another bomb.
The bomb in Surat Than was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
The strike killed a city employee.
At least one person was injured.
The police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were used in the Surat Than attack, which were detonated about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded outside two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple sculls
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for a Rio championship in the throwing, jumping and bowing.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He's got eight individual world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the quadruple and perm championships three times in a row, and the pole last year and the year before.
As a member of the U.S. team, Biles has won two world championships in team competition.
Biles has more than a World Cup medal, he's got a bounce and a bump.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "The weather has no effect on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's playground in the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think anything more wonderful will follow", says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some 20 years.
As a seasoned businessman, he has seen firsthand many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year, the bombing in Bangkok.
If these past trips haven't driven out tourists, this one probably won't.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard the shot from one of his employees.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach road and the main road Bangla Road were completely closed due to the strikes in the early morning.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were put in place because of the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere at Patong was calm, and the main street was allowed to reopen at about ten o'clock local time.
On the beach, many people had never even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 p.m. Thai time, traffic in Patong had returned to normal and most stores had opened.
The explosion was small, according to Huovila, who was at the scene.
Later, the car in question was seen in Crown Heights on the Jouxholmin road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
Patrol spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby bush.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other one got away, but the man was later found in the woods by a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of motor vehicle, theft and gross mischief.
The police are grateful for any leads.
The President of the Russian Federation on the change of leadership: clear dismissal
Russia on Friday made its most high-profile leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his administration's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino, who is of Estonian descent.
He's an ex-diplomat and former Ivanov number two.
Kangaspuro says the reason for firing Ivanov may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the rotation of managerial positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to stop people from asserting power independent of the president.
The fabric company also says it's possible that Ivanov has had a run-in with other top executives or has screwed up.
The fall of Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be assigned to special duties in the field of environment and transport.
Putin, in a tape broadcast by state media, said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said that Ivanov had asked for his transfer to other posts and had proposed Vaino as his replacement, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it's a clear decline.
Environment and transport are not very high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the peak of Russian power.
Ivanov has also played a key role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kanguroasp points out that the old ways, such as governors, have been replaced in Russia recently.
Senior fellow Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that what's more interesting than the successor to Ivanov is that Putin is switching his entourage to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated into Syria.
They used civilians as human shields to escape to the town of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars to be taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters last week took control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
But it's estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Earlier, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters were kidnapping civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says public law professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authorities' own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to release the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the State Council and by the fact that the information was entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's communications director tells STT that the Ministry sees a need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt 's last Olympic show is starting in Rio .
As in previous years, Bolt has been racing against time under the title.
He injured his back in the first round and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic trials.
I know this hasn't been a perfect setup, but I'm in much better shape.
"I've been practicing well and that's key", Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and fanatical reporters.
The portrait around Bolt highlights the fact that the Jamaican star has emerged in an era when public sport has struggled with doping scandals and dwindling interest.
Bolt's previous Olympic loss came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the heats of the 200 meters in a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise, slowed by injuries and a lack of training.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a 100-meter dash, which he broke the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite the final result of 9.69 seconds.
This one 's harder .
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career-high point by measuring the time with a watch.
The world records set in Berlin at 9.58 and 19.19 meters per 100 meters are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he's going to set the world record in the 200 meters and the 19-second sub, but no one believes in its birth except for Bolt himself.
In the 100m, Bolt's toughest challenger is the 2004 Olympic winner in the 100m, Justin Gatlin, from Athens.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt beat an American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost a single title final since he took over in Beijing, if he's ever been there.
In the 2011 World Cup final, Bolt was disqualified for a foul.
Bolt will be turning 30 in a week.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and Rio is his last Olympics.
And with the final finish line of his career, Bolt has set the stage for next year's world championships in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart from the rest.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it", Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rios: two athletes suspected of doping offences
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian athlete Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with traces of epo-hormones.
She finished fourth in the women's 100 meter butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadão, the Chinese smoker has taken his doping case to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that Xiny's sample from Sunday's test showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspected doping cases have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female athlete Silvia Danekova has tested positive for doping with traces of the hormone epo.
Kenya, meanwhile, has sent a Rio athletics coach home for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test event and provided a doping sample to prove it.
Media reports indicate that the suspect is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
The Daily Mail reported that he had used the race car of Ferguson Rotich, an 800-meter runner, in the incident.
Nothing can stop Phelps . Historical gold has come to the show .
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the American Michael Phelps, swam in the 200-meter medley for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
Sam Phelps became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same event in four consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1 minute, 4 seconds, 66 seconds.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mixed doubles, ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, says BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughing in a quick interview with the Daily Mail.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is the most read story on the Evening News website this week.
And next to him is the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not stressed out by the slightest rumor in the press or the British press about her revealing and peculiar attire.
Well, television is a visual medium, he insists.
Skelton is wearing high-heeled shoes and a short-cut dress that I'm sure has at least enough exposure to it - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But no backtracking is allowed.
It's important to look good, and small breasts are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be pleasant and maybe even upsetting, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the scare has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton chuckles.
You know what?
It's a hoot from nothing if it comes from the (headmistress's) attire.
I'm a little amused if one of these has ever hit anyone's radar.
The Rio police made two arrests on terrorism charges.
The police in Rio announced on Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The arrests were made by the police as part of the security checks at the races.
The police made five other arrests in the same connection and questioned two people before releasing them.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to G1 news site, the individuals arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The suspects are believed to have links to the Islamic State.
The detainees were known to have incited violence on social media.
Messages inciting violence had been posted on popular WhatsApp, among others.
The Rio Olympics are run by 85,000 police officers.
Police blow up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their opening match of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty arena on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package at the basketball arena and closed it down.
The police let the public in after they had controlled the explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled demolition mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was allowed in after the police had controlled the explosion of the package.
The crowd was unable to gather for the match because police had temporarily closed the arena due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the public into the hall afterwards.
The beverage woke the sleepy Spanish team that had started the race.
Spain, who had started the games with two losses, beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the previous two Games, Spain won silver.
Police conducted controlled detonation for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police were forced to blow up a suspicious find near a cross-country cycling finish last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their opening round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty arenas.
Argentine lady punched the Siren of the Deceiver - Finnish protest
The Wind of the Willow had a colorful day at Rio.
The wind was strong on Thursday.
The Argentine lady beat the Winds of Cheat Siren on Thursday at the opening round of the women's surfing day in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted the violation.
He got stuck in the crash, and the others ran away, according to Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete thought long and hard about the protest.
It was not worthwhile, since it would have been futile under Olympic rules.
I should have fallen in the water to get my reward, Sir the Deceiver said.
The Finn hung on his board until the end because he did not want to be in the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish driver was in 27th place after the crash.
In the overall standings, the 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
The crash had little effect on the engine.
Friday is a big day, with the 10th to the 12th race.
Unlike the first report, the Deceiver-Siren did not protest.
7 Things That Science Say Will Extend Your Life
Science has explored everything between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his life is prolonged.
On the other hand, at times things beyond one's control can add years to one's life.
These include a tendency to be obese or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't always have to push yourself. You just have to go get the milk jug.
Many studies have tried to unravel the mystery of longevity.
Medical Daily listed seven of the most bizarre findings.
Science says all of these things can add years to your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with "reduced risk of death", especially from neurological or heart disease.
Alcohol is backed up by research that shows that moderate consumption - one to three servings a day - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by as much as six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation of the intestines.
They, in turn, can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected the life of a person.
The seven-year project followed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment than were those who were vomiting.
Sex, when it is considered to be a protection against venereal diseases, is found in many studies to be good for health.
In addition, it can extend life.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
To add years to a person's life, they must also have an orgasm.
I'm sure sports will add years to your life, there's no denying that.
However, achieving longevity does not require absolute shyness.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to the mortality of the low-born.
Whether it's an Olympic medal-winning athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he's more likely to live beyond the average buck.
Many studies have been conducted to try to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to achieve such honors as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior in people over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily is less likely to live as a shopping parent.
This is because working in a physical store reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause premature death.
So, put your credit card down - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver slammed into a truck .
A serious truck and passenger car collision occurred in Koske, in western Finland, on Friday night.
The accident happened in Kosk, between Kosk and Sorvaston on Friday at 9:00 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when an oncoming passenger car had driven into the same lane, hitting the truck at a right angle.
The truck was left on the sidewalk after the crash, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car slid into a ditch and then across the ditch on its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who was driving a car was crushed in her car.
The rescue team removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test came back at 2.02 promille.
He's being charged with gross misdemeanor DUI.
The post office sent the loose change to the wrong town .
The K-City market had a shortage of snacks because the post office had accidentally delivered a part of the load to Seinäjök.
Teija Haltia, a resident of Pernio, was shopping for sweets at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when she noticed a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there's a shortage of products in the unloading rooms because the Post Office delivered our shipment to the Seinäjo!
We'll have more when the Post gets the shipment!
So unless there's a traffic jam on the lawnmower, the sign says.
The sign for the shopkeeper is linked to the fact that last spring Posti extended its services to include lawn mowing.
The lawn mower is on the Post's menu until the end of August.
Haltian thought the sign was mostly funny and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update has me overwhelmed.
The media has been calling all the time, and the attention this has gotten is incredible, Halti wonders.
Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
The elves were able to get their own favourites into a bag of loose candy, even though a few barrels were empty.
The Commission has not yet received any comments from the applicant.
The background is that three of the five boards went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make the part delivery (to the saloon) with three, but we took five boards today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first to report on the matter was the Evening News.
And the reason that Mr. Haltia wasn't mad at the sign was because he found all of his own loose candy in the catalog.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 pounds, posted a picture of herself changing.
The comedian-producer has lost tens of pounds since the birth of her baby.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of her life-changing decision.
Lotta shared the photo of the couple's change on Instagram on Friday.
By spring, Lotta was in a fitness class and aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in the year 2014.
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund began her weight loss campaign in 2009.
She has made a complete lifestyle change and has quietly lost 80 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of Instagram photos of his stunning performance.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo shoot has garnered many appreciative comments from public speakers.
You are so beautiful.
We're on the same path, motivation is high!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
Your pictures give me such power and excitement, as I'm on the same journey, another tells.
Last spring, Lotta lost the last few pounds on the "Do It Now" project.
At the time, he told Iltalehd that he wanted to finally reach his normal weight, which was then ten kilos.
After three months of fasting, the weight dropped to five pounds.
The family of the woman murdered in Loviisa wishes: The victim's memories for the police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa last week wishes that the victims would be remembered with a donation to police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
The Sipoon Veterinary Medical Center has posted a Facebook update to share the wishes of the victim's family for donations to help police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Hospital and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary station remembers her with touching words.
Cheerful, smart, had a sense of humor, and never feared work.
My dear friend.
We're still not quite able to accept that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update says that the donations go entirely to the police dogs, primarily for the safety harnesses.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehd that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned a number of animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a hen.
The 27-year-old suspect in the murder didn't know the woman and had no connection to her.
The murderer was accompanied by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
But Borje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violating the Equality Act
The Postal Service had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform a hired worker, the Kanta-Hämeen plaintiff court said in its ruling.
The district court ordered Post to pay the employee the greater part of the withheld salary and EUR 2 000 compensation for discrimination.
The Court held that Posti could only deduct from the guide's salary a proportion corresponding to the guide's share of the total day's work.
The Court of First Instance held that the employee had been placed at a disadvantage, contrary to the Equality Act, on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision on the prohibition of information.
During the postal strike last November, the PAU made a decision that the Post employees would not investigate renters who violated the strike.
The National News first reported the matter.
Turkey's return to respect for human rights
The EU is also calling for the abolition of the death penalty, and for the EU to take action to combat it.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the report, which calls for the EU to be more involved in the fight against terrorism.
The Journalists' Union had earlier asked Sipilä and Soinia in their letter to express their concern about freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and of expression in Turkey.
Putin fired his administration chief to replace an Estonian persecutor.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is replaced by the grandson of the Soviet-Viron Communist leader, Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
As of March 2014, he was the Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration.
Vassalos will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a close associate of Putin, will be transferred to the special task force for environmental and transportation issues, according to a Kremlin press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for the transfer and suggested that Vaino be replaced, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era as a KGB spy.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin's re-election as President in 2012.
The BBC: ManU's abandonment of the away game will not be seen at the Premier League opening
The world record holder for the most football transfers will not be seen on the pitch as the Premier League was kicked out of the ground this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling was followed by a ban on England.
Manchester United's Paul Pogba is suspended from the game as ManU opens their league campaign against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid €105 million to the Italian club Juventus for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was suspended from Juventus.
He got two rebounds in the Italian Cup last season, and that's one game suspension.
That ban has been extended to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next game is the second leg of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The Flow Festival's meticulous criteria and ambitious vision have established it as an internationally acclaimed event, with the world's top artists as its stars.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
The Festarians have typically expressed themselves through their own distinctive style of dress.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area is decorated with, among other things, artificial turf and art installations.
We have never been satisfied with just a headboard and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which is being held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The success of the event is based on a simple question: What kind of event would the event organizers want to attend?
It's a little unusual in the event industry to think this way.
The aim is often to achieve the level of necessity and to act according to the rules of the authorities, says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out this year.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors from last year's 70,000 to 5,000.
This year, the festival will again feature a number of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in turnover is a good thing, because what you do has to be funded somehow.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, for at some point the mass would be like a cattle herd being herded along huge lanes.
We don't want that.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over the course of 13 years to include 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and bars in the partly artificial area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, 15,000 people will be performing in tents this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be done more simply.
I may be a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've managed to preserve Flow's spirit.
If we lose it, this is no longer our case.
Kallio's greatest joy and reward for his work is that even great visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event, the mid-2000s activities were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of about 20 000 euros.
The turnover of the limited company operating Flow was about EUR 6 million last year.
It can be used to accomplish "even the smallest things", such as the erection of that tent, which is seventy-three meters wide.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive way.
And, by the way, when you talk about a music event, you can also talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled in a particularly fashion.
We want to differentiate ourselves first and foremost by our content.
However, the fashion phenomena also fit into Flow's world of values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main acts on the stage is punk legend Iggy Pop, 69.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he will be seen on the road in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what they play on commercial radio.
And Iggy's latest album is fucking great, and he's done some really great gigs in the last few years.
The bombs were hidden in the flower pots of Thailand 's tourist paradise . The tourists fled in terror .
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night, local time.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured in the attack.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a wallet and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
The bombs were detonated as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife activist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a highly publicized image of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't look right, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said that a bomb had gone off at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar-streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of casualties is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also the favourite of the Finns.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one person was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one unexploded bomb in Hua Hin.
According to Thai authorities, the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet reports that the police have recently been caught up in the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new emergency forces will be the first to go into battle in a war situation
In an emergency, the guards are ordered to fight only months after taking the oath of military service, reports Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnis, the head of the Defence Forces' training, interviewed by Lehden, for example, of the reservists serving 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are at the end of their training are combat-ready.
According to the head of training, the first order of business is to assign reservists from the reserve forces.
No soldier or reservist is ordered to a mission for which he has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it emerged that the Defence Forces will start training reservists for the emergency response units from next year.
The units may be used for military purposes as early as the training of conscripts.
Pamela Tola was paid a fortune by the gay-themed
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, Managing Director Pauli Waroma, have won a bitter legal battle over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of the two-storey detached house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing a microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014 to be demolished.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so that the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court, where they demanded a reduction in the price.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the court of law and in the court of law.
The court of appeals ruled Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 in price reductions.
The seller must also pay the couple's legal and administrative costs, totalling EUR 47 344.
The court reasonably reduced the price somewhat, since the buyer was already aware of the need for repairs to the apartment at the time of the sale.
However, the Court of Appeal held that the construction defects were substantially more serious than had been claimed.
Tola was looking for a home that was in good shape.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a good home because they did not want to undertake the repair work.
He had the impression that the building was in good repair and in good condition and that the inspection report had no problems.
The environmental inspection report mentioned as risks and disadvantages ventilation and inadequate management of rain and meltwater flowing down the cliffs.
However, the discussions did not reveal any urgency.
Tola and Waroma held that perhaps within a few years, the rainwater from the rock should be diverted a little.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than had been thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which the Witnesses said was due to both the rainwater from the rock and capillary-induced soil erosion.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that microbial air could also enter the interior through the porch.
Molds or moulds with a potential health risk exceeding the limit values were found in the brush marks in the household toilet, on the cellar door, in the living room window and in the laundry room in the cellar.
The terraces were built without a permit .
The court also disputed whether the extension of the apartment was contrary to the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the apartment had been altered contrary to the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built without proper permits.
But the homosexual issue was a central issue in the trial.
The Court of Appeal held that the information provided by the seller before the sale could have led the purchasers to assume that the building was suitable for living in its present state and that there was no need for any major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider there to be any particular reason to carry out a wider inspection than is customary.
The Court held that the purchasers had not failed to fulfil their obligation to purchase.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - Finnish women in the register
In a recent article in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilm records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women applied to become Nazi marshals.
The documents and registration cards are from the Racial Bureau, which operated in Nazi Germany.
The Office of Race was under the command of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of even larger numbers of women who had to be able to give birth to as many as 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women underwent gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The Office of Race Censorship investigated the women's backgrounds by examining church books, among other things.
The idea was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Board a handwritten biography and good recommendations from relatives.
The racial department wanted assurances that the women were "child-lovers", "savings-of-the-earth", and "good National Socialists" who spoke well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either married or unmarried.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on the family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting child-bearing.
The German Mother's Cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were prohibited by law, according to the museum website.
The traitor Siren sixth, the dwarf rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the Finnjolli sailing day at the Rio Olympics, but finished last in the second start of the day.
Nirkko moved up to eighth place in the overall standings after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th place.
The Wind of the Five-Siren fought the RS:X class day trips at positions 17 and three.
In the overall standings, Siren the Fool is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening round of the day.
In the overall standings, the Lindgrens are 19th.
Jari Satoulinna was recorded sleeping for a couple of hours at night: "I was so drunk"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite artists of Finnish people for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship bartender to the 1995 Tango King, Finland's best-selling solo artist and star of dance clubs and festare, Sillanpää can still be seen and is currently in a frenzy.
The book, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of her favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Naked, was published today, Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career, both good and bad.
But his career rose to an all-time high when he won the King of Tango crown at the Seinäjoki Tang Market in 1995.
At the contest, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already planned a different kind of music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted into a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so fucked up!
The bridgehead is mentioned in the book.
A recording of a song that became a huge hit would not immediately suggest that it was sung in a drunken stupor.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't always have to be perfect and top of the line.
The second coincidence related to his most popular songs, which is related in the book, happened almost two decades later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from her then-partner and the case eventually ended up in the lyrics of the song "You deserve gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics of the songs ordered from Saara Törmäne were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the break-up were not true, but it was written based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper said that the reason for the break-up was because of his excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was all bullshit and not true.
Jari, according to the book, angrily called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and well.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting to leave the EU.
In the end, 52 percent of voters supported leaving and 48 percent would have remained in the union, even though opinion polls during the voting week predicted the opposite.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support for staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university supported the split, even though a few individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the campaign slogan of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", was dropped into the dustbin of the British Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked to see that the economy did not seem to be the most important political issue.
The economic whirlwind
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics is gathering responses from the professional community to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most common answer is that economists were not consulted, because this time the voters decided on a basis other than economic.
One of the reasons economists say that the economy is losing its position is that people don't understand the economy.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of hours worked, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's right off the British.
Many also feel that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it would help the export industry.
The Committee of the Regions believes that the economic arguments were not believed by the voters because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's impartiality, which gave just as much space to the few per cent of economists who supported the EU's break with the EU as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic powerhouses think of the consequences of the divorce.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, the national debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with which the voters themselves do not feel they have a common interest.
The message was not received in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The winning argument in the Brexit vote was immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant overcrowds your hospital, the immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments are working.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would be available to the British if they left?
Every health center waiting room has immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a Brit to get medical appointments if there were none?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real Brit to get a place in school if they were to be disposed of?
Every town has foreigners.
How much more room would the natives have if they just left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But the economists failed to answer them, and if they did, their answers were not given visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants are the reason why brostites have more jobs, fewer health care lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK public finances and their spending creates jobs.
The Aberdeen Real Estate Fund was prepared for Brexit with cash.
One of these funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish investor Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that in Aberdeen, they prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B: preparations for the victory of the pro-Brexit camp were started a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a 'no' vote.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their assets out of the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have measurable liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We were sent to grow cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says, of the only Aberdeen open daily highly quoted real estate fund that was in the news.
The old man said the normal range would be 15 to 20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says, of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds was at 10 percent or even less.
So the real estate funds were preparing for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds are shutting down the trade.
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went into a tailspin.
The real estate market was relatively calm for the two weeks following the vote, Vanhanen said.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they seized the situation and made headlines in the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started rolling, and one after another, the trust had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash they had collected, but they were eventually forced to freeze their trade for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close the deal, they just changed the pricing down.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worthwhile to withdraw the money in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you didn't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't be worth it, because you would be making losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them dropped the ad.
The market has been fairly stable since then, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no such upheaval in the Aberdeen Continental European Funds, for example.
But there were a lot of inquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
The closures of the real estate funds received too much attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control about 4% of the UK's real estate.
Aberdeen was closed for six days, and the company sold off less than ten properties out of its 80 in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may be holding its funds until mid-2017.
The uncertainty is now high and the economic growth forecasts have been downgraded, but the situation does not look any "worse" for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now are about the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even opened up new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound is at its weakest dollar in 30 years, and the market is down 15% from the pre-Brexit days.
Now, a dollar retailer can buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
Old Man says there's a lot of people who want to buy.
Brexit has brought downside to London's property market
By two in the morning, the situation did not look too bad.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of real estate investment at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to look again at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power of it.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says Vanhanen in his other home in Helsinki.
He was headed straight to work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the dawn.
The normally quiet TV screens in the office were playing the news, and the normally noisy crowd was completely silenced to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped before the camera this morning to announce his divorce.
When the market opened, the ends of the display were flashing red.
It was a morning that he never thought he'd live to see, the old man says.
Not only that, but despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the largest property funds in the UK, completed two property deals the day after the Brexit vote, in a joyous way.
It was a mixed atmosphere.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pin fell, the British leadership changed.
The market was starting to anticipate a sharp downturn in the UK, and particularly in London's housing market.
London office space was projected to be reduced by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now that the storm has subsided, there's still uncertainty in the air.
But it's not the Old Man who spent his last summer days in Helsinki this week.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
So much remains open: how the difference is made and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Preliminary information on the development of the London property market has already been obtained.
CBRE, the property services company, covers about one third of the market in terms of price developments.
They show that the price of all London properties fell by 3.3 per cent between June and July.
The City of London office buildings were down 6.1%, Vanhaen said.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're month-to-month changes.
The monthly index was launched in 1987 and only five months have seen worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All equally large declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It's interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the U.S. housing market.
The old man thinks the analogy is not quite right, because this is a British domestic crisis.
The tunnel machine is the other.
The real estate market has not seen the panic selling of that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's always a way to pay for it.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle to him - one that could have been ahead even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that London and other world-class cities have been overpriced for years.
"We've been saying for two years now that the City and especially the offices are overpriced", Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London prices have skyrocketed for four reasons, Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has London's population.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last property class to go global, Vanhanen says.
New entrants from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutional and private investors are looking for investment opportunities abroad.
London, as a city, is a destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to seek returns on new items.
On top of this, credit has been readily available - although debt leverage has been used, according to Vanhassen, now significantly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Spread it out, spread it out.
In London, the price increase was levelled last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to dilute its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
You'd expect some kind of twist, and now it's happened.
What's next?
The EU is also looking to the UK to provide a more robust and effective response to the crisis.
He is not very sure what he will do, but he says that there is no chance of a big jump.
The mood indicates that we have a downhill or a flat course ahead.
The old man has seen a lot of ups and downs, 'cause he's been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the pits can be worked out.
If you're prepared to take risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much to sacrifice.
If you have diversified, you have diversified the risks, says Vanhanen.
S Group starts recording more detailed purchasing information
Soon, S Group will know what you're eating, as the retailer announced today that it will begin collecting more detailed information about its regular customers' purchases.
By now, the group will have collected the final receipt amount and will begin to collect it from purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S Group follows Kesko in this respect, since the data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes under licence.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Very few customers have refused to use product data, Riitala tells Taloussanom.
He said Kesko wasn't going to react to the change in registration of the S-Group.
The union classifies its lawyers in ten groups based on their purchases of food alone.
The ranking is updated monthly.
The number of transactions and the amount of money spent on them are also used to classify retail customers.
The information is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
The partners, such as Neste Oil, do not share their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty programme and has no plans to do so at this time.
Finnish Retail has its own Ykkösbonus customer support programme, which can be joined at Valintalo, Siwo and Euromarket.
At present, we do not collect data at product or product group level, but at the final receipt level.
So we know where the purchases were made, and on what day, and the customer's receipt for the balance.
We have not gone to that level as K-group or S-group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
He said that the regular customer programme was to be renewed in the future, but that the local shop would inform him later.
However, the Commission does not promise that product data will be recorded.
First, the experiment.
The customer and customer register of SOK has been relatively extensive up to now.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data also included occupation, education, form of residence, and birth years and previous personal data of children.
The persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also recorded.
The S-E card records the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchase and the method of payment.
In addition, information on the S-bonus partners is obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in the S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, the data are recorded at product group level for the time being.
"We have been asking customers for some time to target marketing more precisely", says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK's head of customer acquisition and partnerships.
S Group says they'll notify their clients of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is stored in the registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
If you want to check your saved data, you can do so on the S-group website.
The Commission has also been asked to make a proposal on the future of the European Union.
Video: Heila the puppy is Tull's newest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosion dog
A black labrador pup is vigorously sniffing at five boxes lined up in the same way at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before he's sitting firmly beside the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila for playing with his favorite toy.
From the drawer next to which Heila sat, a can of powdered gas-smelling holsters was revealed.
"The smell of gunpowder is the first smell that we've practiced with Heila", says Suntio, the owner of Heila's dog.
Security and reasons for online trading
Heila is Tullin's first dog to specialise in the search for weapons and explosives and will be put to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main location for Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks prompted the customs authorities to take measures and after the attacks, the supervision has been strengthened, says the Customs Supervisor Mikko Grönberg.
Another way to train gun and explosive dogs is through the postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the growth of Internet commerce, the airport receives up to 40 million mailings a year, which may include foreign-ordered munitions and explosives.
In recent years, customs has made about 300 finds at Helsinki-Vantaa airport in the online shopping, passenger airline luggage and air freight sector, relating to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's going to be checking registered luggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great use in the future, as it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the dog, Customs will evaluate whether to train more gun and explosive dogs in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in my church
The training of the Heila-puppy is coordinated by the Dog School of Tullin in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also trains with Heila with police and Defense experts.
The police have a strong background in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, along with other authorities, will decide what scents Heila is taught to detect.
Heila is always given further training as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs and Massi, a money and drug dog.
Heila, a Labrador retriever, has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog for an airport include rest and hunting instinct, as well as peace of mind, since the dog will be exposed to weapons, explosives, and human flows.
Heila, who lives in Sunto's home, is a close coworker of the customs inspector, but also a member of his family.
Nothing comes home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
The delicate orders are going to Heila from the top of the head.
The Night's Messenger cameraman loses the camera's mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila restores the soft toy-like cover immediately on the "go away" command.
Hard-working dogs , tough competition .
Heila's primary school will be finished next year.
The next level tests, due in October, will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
If all goes according to plan, you can see Heila in action at Helsinki Airport next year.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to pet the dog wearing a work vest, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog to customs is about EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work periods last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There's a lot of competition in Customs to own a working dog.
He hired about 20 to 30 people from Customs to own the Heila.
Lucky Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but years of experience with dogs and guarding duties at Customs.
The Mini-State won its first Olympic medal . The people get a day off .
With a population of less than a million, the Olympic gold in rugby is so highly valued in Fiji that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the government of Fiji confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The team's release day is the day after the team returns home.
And the heroes will be celebrating in their homeland.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated their championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen was installed on the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish entertainer passed out after a wild performance
The printer Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight of 175 kilos.
Tocolas have a peculiar and life-threatening property as a hoist.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 pounds from the push and 145 from the pull.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his work done with his last 175 kilos, as well as his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with a furious scream.
His body was shaking under the weight until the jury agreed to the lift.
The Finnish woman's joy was accompanied by the fact that she had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired the Estonian striker Prosan - The League of Sports - Evening News
The Rovaniemi Palloseura, which plays in the men's football league, has signed an end-of-season contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player for our team, with a lot of potential and a low threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with over a dozen agent players.
"We are not going to be able to do that", he said.
Prosa, 25, joins RoPS from Flora in the town of Tallinn, where he has scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonia national team.
Prosan is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovan natives will face the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's King of the Moose, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star is back in action again: Teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, now known as Alex Dunphy, has once again shocked the world with her bold body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in a pair of miniskirts that leave little to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has posed in photos on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scantily clad clothing.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on TV almost her entire life, and she grew up with the Kardashians.
"The more you see, the more you've learned that the more you expose the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood", Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on the show Modern Family when he was 11.
The actor has upset some of his longtime fans with his makeover.
It's not hard to guess where he'll be in ten years, when the bottom is already this hard, says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some fans of the actress, however, defend her and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a young woman with a lot of energy.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland , and the tourists are attracted by the aurorae , which are the fabled mirror of the aurora in autumn .
The campaign aims to attract Japanese people to start their sunrise trips as early as autumn, says a press release from Visit Finland.
The main destinations for sun tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
The snow lights are the hallmark of our winter travel and are strongly associated with the landscape of heart-shaped winter and snow.
The demand for winter skiing in Lapland is very high, but we are now trying to increase the sales of the autumn skiing.
Few people know that the springtime season begins in early autumn and continues well into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the sun's rays, making the sight twice as spectacular, says Anne Lind, Visit Finland's marketing manager.
The main target group for the Visit Finland campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its landscape and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, by online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University, Turku and Tokyo Universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
But the Japanese would like to see more distinct and unique sights from Finland, and this reef has a huge potential, according to Lind.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in the Rugby Sevens, as Fiji's champions won gold.
Britain's impressive record in the seven-a-side rugby was crushed when Fiji won it in the final at Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, 437.
Fiji was the masters in ball handling, passing, side-kicking, back-stroke, running line and roughness, winning gold - if it was the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
The loss meant silver, a slightly bigger consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first-ever Olympic rugby sevens tournament, where the team beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight victory by South Africa's Boxe in the 75 semi-final earlier in the day could have affected the team negatively in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fiji team in this form would have beaten the British, even if the 15-man team was at full strength.
It may be a relief to the British people that at least one Briton will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, a former Wimbledon-born coach of the England rugby sevens team.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens tournament under Ryan.
They only lost one game in Rio.
I know it hurts to lose, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started out well and introduced his tapping skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had been crushed by a swarm of moving buses, and the world champions were leading by five points as Osea Kolinisau made a dash for the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored the second goal from the right-handed goal kicker.
It was 12 to 0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's spectacular tackle prevented the stunned Leone Nakarawaa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow down Fiji's advance for long.
Seven minutes into the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a right-hand corner goal, which left Great Britain 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored the second goal of the second half, with over a minute remaining in the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou stormed through the weaker tackles of the British team and jumped over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with a score of 29 to 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-a-side rugby, whereas the British were still in the role of the apprentice.
Which is pretty much true.
Great Britain made a sweeping change at half-time and managed to hold the Fijians for a full four minutes, a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored, thanks to the excellent team play of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the scoring to 36-7 to the British in the left corner, but the game was long lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was hard not to admire the pure joy of Fiji.
Mata Viliame made the final shot to the Fijians' cake by scoring in the final moments.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan in the semi-final by 20 to 5 and Great Britain had narrowly outplayed South Africa in the tight semi-final, where a draw decided the UK's goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with a stunning footwork and dropped under the goal posts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson, a rugby player in the England 15 team, sealed the victory and eventually the silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win gold.
There's no more emotional gold in these races.
From first pitch to last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning raced 220 victorious pitches into history and found a new purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in the air, the third coach on the boat, Robin Williams, encouraged them to win their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in women's doubles, making them the first women in British sporting history to achieve such a feat.
Their superiority was unquestionable, their 39th consecutive victory, and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the water surface like a swan, does not fully correspond to the nature of success.
Behind every southpaw is a large group of helping hands, each of whom has contributed two to one, but the most important of all is a coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who didn't know if he would live to see this day.
Williams said it was a tough time.
"I had bladder cancer, and they were able to remove it.
If it wasn 't for the surgery , it would have spread everywhere .
And it would have been pretty bad.
It's a little bit of a change of mind".
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that Williams was able to begin his treatment in the off-season in early 2014, when the interruption caused the least disadvantage, if such a circumstance can be said.
"I needed money, so I had to get better fast.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward for six, nine, and 15 meters at a time, when they said that a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
The woods themselves are a long way off, but this one made it a little bit bigger".
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were on Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own anxiety.
Captain Stanning, of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, who was on a tour of Afghanistan, says: "I've been in ruins this week on an emotional level, which is maybe a little extreme, but it means so much".
"It just goes to show how much this means to me and how much Helen and Robin and I have worked together.
The last three years of Helen and Robin's fund have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him, thank him, thank him, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not have wished for a better person to train with, or a better coach".
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single competition in the last five years.
The duo have found a supreme rhythm that their competitors have failed to match.
Even in the last half mile, when the New Zealand and Danish twins started to approach, Stanning and Glover still had their spare power.
"We were very much caught up in the moment.
Helen Hook, "Keep up with the Joneses, keep up with the Joneses".
It is very important not to be led off course".
"We did well in leaving, and at the same time we did not try to do anything extraordinary.
We didn't want to go to heaven today, we just wanted to make a good shot and win the race, which we did".
The two of them will spend a year thinking about their future.
Glover is celebrating his wedding with a TV nature presenter named Steve Backshall next month.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure".
"After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to pass out.
This feels so much better", he says.
Iceland replaces the government stolen by the Panama Canal
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters, angered by the Panama leaks, are demanding as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes by using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that wasn't enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised at the time to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now set for October 29th.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the latest public fury will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of the incumbent was evident, and the candidate from outside politics, Gudni Johannesson, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he said that Obama was the founder of ISIS.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has cancelled his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic when he said that the incumbent President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation ISIS and that the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the creation of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink that low, your Clinton tweets, be the commander in chief of the military.
The mayor of Cannes in southern France has banned the wearing of the burkini, a popular Muslim swimsuit, at beaches, reports the Guardian, a British newspaper.
The decree, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that beaches and swimming are forbidden to anyone who does not wear a bathing suit that is respectful of good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits that express religious sentiments in a grandiose way may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove his car into a crowd celebrating France's national day.
In late July, two extremist men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France, killing a priest in his 80's.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region was superior to that of the blue-green algae in the Lake of the Wash.
O The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only the lake has been found to be affected.
During the week of Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Service took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
The concentration of E. coli and enterotococci in the bathing water of all bathing areas except the coast of the Mediterranean was below the action levels set by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E. coli and enterococcus levels in the seawater pool were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action levels.
The blue-green sediment found on the shore of Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favorable conditions it can quickly turn into a blue-green sediment, forming a blue-green alkali mass on the surface of the water.
The Environmental Action Programme is monitoring the situation closely.
If the bluefin turtle turning into a bluefin, this shall be separately indicated on the swimming pool bulletin board.
Check out the results of the swimming pool samples here.
The EU has a stronger role to play in the reduction of forest loss in the EU.
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Treasury's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the succession of the estate.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a reduction in the forest endowment has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of timber.
The Ministry's objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct from the net capital income of the forestry.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote generational changes in forestry is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, director of the forestry association MTK.
But Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the tax reform bill.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
It's the capital gain minus all the other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen consider that the tax reduction would be more effective if it could be deducted directly from the sales of wood.
The draft of the MoU is based on the assumption that by deducting from the net capital income of the forestry sector, it is prevented that there would be a loss of capital income for the forestry sector which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if the wood was not sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to visualize it, says Hakkarainen.
Furthermore, he says the model only affects a small proportion of forest owners.
The limit for the tax deduction linked to the forest yield value is EUR 40 000.
It's been raised too high by the Snitch.
As such, he said, it would remove 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the deduction.
The model would affect about 10% of the forest ownership community, he says.
The GM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of the farm.
In forestry policy, reducing deforestation has been taken for granted for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It's based on the aging of the forestry community.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful gust of rage overwhelmed the motorists on the Himalayas . Two cars slid into a ditch and crashed into each other .
On Friday morning, a strange event occurred on the Himanga River.
According to the rescue service, two cars driving in a row crashed into a ditch, after which the one behind slammed into the one in front.
According to the current fire chief, Harry Wipes, the suspected entry into the ditch was due to a violent rage.
Two people were in the car behind him and were taken to the hospital for treatment.
Their injuries are not known.
The driver of the car that was in front of us was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 in Himanga a few kilometers towards Kala Lake.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku may help to develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and the cells of the tissue grow normally in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the cancer was stopped from growing in the laboratory by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to a normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug therapies may be enhanced by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, in addition to cancer cells.
The findings were published on August 4 in the respected journal Nature Communications, a cell biology journal.
The murder of the family friend of Muhos continues in the court, the prosecutor also demands the murder of the second perpetrator
The murder of the Muhus family continues in the court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to life in prison in June for a family murder in Mohoes.
Another was sentenced to eight years and four months for, among other things, manslaughter and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The other is serving a 12-year sentence for murder and robbery committed when he was a juvenile.
The convicted offender was also convicted of gross endangerment of road safety as a juvenile and of driving a vehicle without a right as a juvenile.
The prosecutor, the plaintiffs, and the man who had received the harsher sentence appealed the decision of the district court.
The prosecution is demanding a lesser sentence for a man convicted of murder committed as a juvenile, to 12 years in prison.
They were fully conscious at the time of the crime.
According to the district court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a child protection instructor at the school last July.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on a sofa in the back of the living room, according to the court's reasoning.
The instructor had let go of his hold and had taken the youth into his room, where one of the youths struck him with a straw.
The conductor was also strangled with a wire, beaten, and kicked in the head.
The state of mind test showed that both convicts were fully conscious at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the youths had been planning to leave the family home since at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's oldest vertebrate, reproducing at 156 years
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed to be a glacier shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the holkers, or ice sharks, can live for up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The ice's life span is increased by only one centimeter a year.
Only one shellfish species is known to outlive the reef shark.
The researchers determined the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residues.
From these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The estimated age of the oldest was 392 years - though, in one direction or another, it can be as high as 120 years.
Donald Trump is an economist
Donald Trump's America does not need to change the world.
Even a third of all government tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump's corporate tax reform is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced by tax breaks that benefit the richest in particular.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he unveiled it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would be lowered from 35 to 15 percent.
If we don't collect it, we're going to have a very large amount of money, a billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after a reduction proposed by Trump of 33.
The tax on inheritance would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating the economy and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards that were so hastily agreed upon must be re-established and the energy sector deregulated.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must appoint 'experts instead of bureaucrats'.
Trump says that "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of America's problems.
The free trade agreements would be terminated.
The tariffs would be increased to 45% on imports from China and 35% from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
"Americanism, not globalism, is our creed", Trump declared.
The America of Donald Trump doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect the cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his usual associates, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program as taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released her own program early Friday, Finnish time.
A blast from the past - People's News
The sea roars with fatal force, but a real storm surge hits the heart of Madrid's street gridlock - and the reckoning with the past can begin.
That, in a nutshell, is the essence of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodóvar's previous directorial work, Matkarakastajat (2013) was a dark and gritty satirical comedy, preceded by Iho ku živu (2011) which marked the pinnacle of the Spanish writer's career.
Julieta (2016) is situated somewhere between these two works.
It is a conventional psychological drama of love, relationships, and family, centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
It's a simple story, and you see a lot of it in the long run.
Life seems to be going well for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything is threatened with collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed until the final seconds of the film.
In the form of a long, back-and-forth letter, Juliet recounted the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
She begins the time before the birth of her daughter, the moment she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
The second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher in the popular TV series Ommelten välineinen aika (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that could be considered clumsy, but I would say quite literally and verbally with a wheeze.
From the frankness that is often characteristic of Almodóvar films to the humor, Juliet is a fair distance away.
It's a steady, restrained, somewhat good music and a rather sad film, with an elegiac element.
The Spanish director, on the other hand, retains his visual richness of colour, and thus it begins to catch the eye more as a pure fashion item than as a dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, death, or any other sudden loss, but the surface remains the same.
This is especially true of the costume: in the case of the title character, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true of the showy outfits.
Almodóvar is careful in these matters, but the main thing, the tuning of each scene, is not particularly improved.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is superficial and a little soulless.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three novels by Canadian Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The novels have been published in the collection Karkulainen: Narrative.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat flat-out literary film-making of literature.
The material would have been emotionally immeasurably more pronounced to the drama, the great things - especially the searing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The film is based on the novel by the same name by the French writer, the film stars Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie opens on August 12th.
The government is trying to get elected.
The ministers are saying that no new cuts will be made so that the Finnish people do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made at the expense of the farmers.
There won't be any more cuts.
The four billion dollars we've already decided to save is enough.
This is the assurance of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Country) under the budgetary line.
Which is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation, because the cuts to social security were already decided in the spring recess.
Child benefit, the National Pension, the basic unemployment benefit and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the Ansiosidonian unemployment insurance scheme is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training operations are continuing.
The municipal elections are haunted .
Why do the ministers insist so strongly that these are the ones who should not be subjected to further cuts?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important heat metric of the election season, not the Gallup polls.
It has been seen before that the divergent views of the ruling parties have long been a disaster for the government.
But Gallup says the ruling party, the Finnish People's Party, is expecting a landslide loss, even though its result in the last elections was a modest 12.3 percent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of the Left received 752 new members of parliament, many of whom will be paying the price for their influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life of a government of three or so large parties depends on the persistence of the Finnish people.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy within the first year.
The first signs of the party's congressional caucus's melting pot have also emerged.
The rhetoric of no new cuts will firstly obscure the fact that next year they will be made drastically and secondly try to soften the expected attack on the Finns.
Big surgery in 2018?
In a year, things will probably be different if the government of the Owl is still standing.
The government has set a target of debt relief for this election term, but in Petteri Orpo's budget proposal, the debt will be raised to 5.9 billion euros next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the election season and admit that the government cannot follow its own agenda: debt-taking will not bend or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means more cuts on top of the existing ones, even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be rounded up to at least near balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will take what comes.
These actions will prevent you from incurring debt
It is clear that the current measures will not be enough to drive debt out of the country, despite Juha Sipilä's efforts to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen at the budgetary briefing are irrefutably clear:
The forecasts for world economic growth have repeatedly proved to be unrealistic, meaning that there is no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has barely recovered from the 2008 crash, except for a temporary recovery in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has risen by 35% in this decade, from an average of 34 weeks to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more per year than in 2008.
The current trend shows that the debt of public sector institutions, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% by the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt settlement proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected as irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered almost entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the central, the assembly and the Finnish people's idea of what is responsible.
Question: Many tasks are left to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of childcare, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a survey by KAKS - the Municipal Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the people also holds the individual municipality responsible for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, secondary education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is clearly defined as the county administration, specialised nursing, vocational training, vocational colleges and institutional care for the developmentally disabled.
No tasks for which the municipalities are responsible are to be transferred to the State.
A drunk driver, a minor, ran from the police after a car chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from a police party in Joensuu on Ilomantsin Road on Friday night at half past one.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle, which was driving without lights, but the young man drove the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonkajan ranta road, from where it continued to the Sorronahon road and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed policeman caught up with him.
The breath test on the driver was 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driver's license that would have authorized him to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious traffic offense.
A truck in a gravel pit fell into a ditch.
A truck with a pile of rocks fell into a ditch on the road to Polvijärvi, Kaavintal, on Thursday night at about 21.15.
The truck had drifted off the road in a left-handed curve and had fallen into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the overturned truck through the overturned door, along with the rescue helicopter crew and paramedics.
The car owner was responsible for the lifting of the vehicle.
A hydraulic oil leaked from the overturned truck onto the road, and was sucked into the peat by the rescue system.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
A beautiful woman went missing this afternoon in the River Aire.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the Lake Lahden area of the South Northeast.
Police are looking for a woman about 5'5", thin, well-groomed, with white hair down to her chin.

The elements of the disaster in the air - see the gallery of photos of the disaster of Parafest
The Parafest tents were swept away by a downpour, causing extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, believes that the festival will be able to get back on its feet financially and that the event can be held again next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the end of Friday night in the market square.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theater, beginning at 1:00 p.m.
The Art Center of Ahjo has a Parafest exhibit at 1 to 3 in the afternoon.
The program will be held as planned.
The downward flow is produced in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its pressure initiate a downward flow of air.
The change in the shape of the water in the cloud cloud traps heat, and thus the descending air cools and accelerates its velocity toward the ground.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that the currents in Finland are strong and sudden, and that they occur several times during the summer.
The path of the shock waves is difficult to predict.
The floodwaters hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the venue for Parafest, Friday afternoon before five.
Three of the tents were down, with about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was a child who was being transported for further treatment with minor injuries.
Londoners Aged by Air Pollution
A study has revealed that Londoners' skin ages faster than normal.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British Evening Standard is reporting on the investigation.
The British skin-care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners in retirement is two and a half years older than that of a peer living in a rural area, for example.
The skin-aging particles are a very fine dust that is derived from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illnesses that kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for those in London who walk to work near busy streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing masks, but a more practical solution is to clean their skin regularly.
The tractor brakes failed to stop the man standing in front of it .
He had been moving rocks in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not hit, but the tractor did push him so far that he was taken to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not go any farther because it ran into the rocks in front of it.
The future of the European Union
The River Island Liiga-Riento, who play in the Volleyball Champions League, will start the series starting in October with better starting points than men.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The tone is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the series has been dark for Rienn.
Jani Säis, who will continue as Riennos head coach, praises the new team for their effort and unity.
The third-string outfielder Fred Musoni is entering his second season at Rienna.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwanda national team, is a 6'9" forward.
Garchet is a passer-by, the Brazilian is 198 centimeters tall.
Through Josba, Kataja and the Joki Boys, to the U.S. national team.
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Sailboat Championship since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, the sixth Games are underway, with only 2013 missing after Canada was better in the North American tests.
I was working in Turku and playing with the piggy women when I saw the ad.
The U.S. was about to form a national team for salibandy.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in Elizabeth, near New York City, in 1967.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as salibandy being played at the SM level.
They used to play football in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in the SM series with the Jokipojki.
Jumppanen played for the university team in the 1991-92 season of the salibandy SM series, the next three seasons were spent in Jospa.
Besides playing, she coached the A-team girls to the state championship.
The women's singles was silver in 1995.
Overall, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series for 10 seasons, accumulating a total of 169 matches with 51+34=85.
The last MLA was 2001-02.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josba, a member of the Joensuu salibandy team, was trained by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, a native of Enola, was selected to play for the Finnish national team in the Tshekin Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who plays for Helsinki Erä, has played in six men's national matches, in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a hip injury and is part of the national team's regular squad with 117 international matches.
The national team also included Mika Kohonen, a Seinäjoen Peliveljien player who was last seen wearing a Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy national team is Petri Kettunen from County Gah.
Beach volleyball star Essi Hassu's circle is closing in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the trophy case
Essi Hasu is about to retire as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after this season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championship will be decided this weekend at the Kouvola Sports Park.
The three-day event will feature both adult and youth division medal matches.
The six best teams in each series qualify for the SM final tournament, which is organized in cooperation between Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Volleyball Federation of Finland.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball elite for several years.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, looks forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see the show this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played Kouvola much in the adult series, so it's nice to play the finals on the home court, Hasu-momo.
The community of Kouvola ignited Hasu's love for sports and provided a fine springboard for a fine pastime.
I have a lot of memories of my childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine with the E-girls of NMKY in Elimä.
"The main thing is the oversized jerseys, the ankle-spinning knee pads, the big-ass chants and choreography after the scores", recalls Hasu.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was fun to play.
All of us had families that were very involved - a teammate's father coaching us, and our mother was the club president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle was already a junior in beach volleyball, a natural rival to indoor volleyball.
The beach at the curling pond has been playing the beats since the 1990s.
The walk has always been active.
I also went to watch the junior SM Tour's half-time shows, hoping that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkki from Belsås in the SM finals.
The goal of the two, who are second in the tournament after Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still short of the SM-gold in the trophy case, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend's performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hassu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await you in the field of civilian work.
The international career is over after the Tournament of the Red Chamber.
Otherwise, the precautionary measures will be put in place at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
A flash flood knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
A downpour knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjala, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
According to the Karjala, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In one of the larger tents, a show was going on.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened Friday at 5:00 p.m.
The day-to-day fire chief, Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation was one of a major accident.
The paper says the continuation of the event is in doubt.

An open, industrial loft in downtown Los Angeles is experiencing a homey transformation
The 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library is being celebrated with a new book, of course.
Salomon Koli was a farmer who was very brave.
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweating and having energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an entrepreneur in agriculture because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Koli started about two years ago with his little brother Valtteri Kolli as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers from his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking out loans and expanding the farm so that bread could be made from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always loved working on a farm, and now that I've started my own business, I've put everything into it.
If you're gonna start something, I think you should start it with a real, serious mind.
In 2013, we started building a backyard pool, and at first, the bank wasn't too keen on it either.
However, I was very brave to join the project and have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything will turn out for the better.
Meat-producing company Salomon Kol is looking to invest in an even bigger vessel.
The work has paid off, as Mr Koli has been selected as one of the top ten young food producers in the Future of the Countryside magazine.
At his best, he's competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until August 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest level in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has exceeded zero since October last year, when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2%.
The Commission recalls that the Commission did not provide any information on the level of the subsidy to the sampled exporting producers.
The CPI index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) has been 0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was 0,2%.
Compared to the previous month, the following categories of consumer goods showed an increase in prices in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7%); transport (1,8%); leisure and culture (6,3%); restaurants and hotels (1,2%); other goods and services (0,3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime-themed content is being criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers say it's racist.
With the Snapchat Lens tool, approximately 150 million daily users can alter reality and play identities in ways that are close to absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are unvarnished, feature-distorting tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All the delusions are quickly made public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for favoring blackface makeup or lightening skin tones as a beauty standard.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that made their eyes crooked, their teeth crooked and their cheeks puckered, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts pointed to a larger problem the company had with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with online publications including The Verge and Motherboard writing about it the day after Snapchat said it had removed its filter.
The company gave the following explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes.
Some people were very vocal about the anime analogy.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the image was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at the very least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is hard to argue against the very bad taste of Asian rice as a filter enhancer.
It shows that the filter is not just yellowface, but one taken to a paralyzing extreme".
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural pitfalls.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governance to Hollywood to the devices we carry around with us.
The large audience on Snapchat is made up of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parents, which may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image that offends the user, this type of thing doesn't go unnoticed as easily as it used to", said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, a product manager and designer at Medium Publishing, decided to delete his Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In a media post and telephone interview, she said she believed that the ethnicity-related conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat's recruiting practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white and male-only board and ended her post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no people of color on their one-sided staff, so they can make these kinds of decisions, or they have people of color on their staff, but they're not in a position to dare to speak their mind directly and easily", says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the allegation.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnicity of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups and promote inclusion within the company.
Zhu, for his part, says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not OK".
A congressional panel of experts has concluded that military officials were misrepresenting intelligence about ISIS .
A congressional panel of experts released a report Thursday that found that officials at the U.S. Central Command altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what was being reported on the ground.
Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee's Intelligence and Defense Appropriations subcommittee formed a task force whose interim report cited "general dissatisfaction" among military intelligence analysts, who said senior military officials were "flattering" their assessment of U.S. actions against ISIS.
Central Command, abbreviated as Centcom, is a United States military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence findings approved by senior Centcom officials generally presented a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism activities than the facts on the ground, and were invariably more positive than those analyzed by other units of the intelligence community", according to a press release on the report.
"The events at Centcom cannot be tolerated  our soldiers suffer as false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers", says California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"Centercom's management mistakes extend to the highest levels of the organization".
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that are contained in the Central Command's descriptions and analysis of US actions to train Iraqi forces.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports commissioned by the Obama administration were falsified, it does provide an analytical picture that suggests that Centcom leaders were pressured to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually occurred", the report says.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015".
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of ISIS.
"After months of research, this is very clear", said Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officers in the U.S. military manipulated intelligence to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq".
The Republicans set up a task force after learning of analysts' suspicions that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, which will be published on Thursday, will provide more details as the investigation continues.
In addition, the inspector general of the Ministry of Defense has launched an investigation into the intelligence of Centcom.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were partially consistent with the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restrictive process for evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces", said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat on the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence, "damaged the morale of analysts", and "inadequately addressed divergent views".
But according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "a pre-determined or official political line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans says in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues".
The investigation has other implications besides seeking to establish whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria were successful (a claim made by several defence authorities).
However, last year's claims raised questions about how much President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis zones.
The criticism of intelligence data on ISIS is a response to the controversy that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published research that found that President George W. Bush's administration, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only a small number of Iraqis and spent little time considering what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker was also a key player in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's task force concluded that, despite contradictory public statements, the attacks on ISIS-run refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built makeshift refineries that allowed it to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the investigation were not communicated outside of Central Command, The Times reported in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers said the testimony before the Senate was too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced as commander of Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth match in women 's field hockey and consolidates its position in the mediation with Great Britain .
After scoring three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, as the U.S. beat India.
To score five goals in two games might be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had achieved the same success before.
"I have no idea", he says.
"I'm not one of those people who puts a number on a painting".
But he knows this: The Americans have won four games and lost zero in their Olympic tournament, and they share the top spot with Great Britain, who continued their winning streak by beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which will determine which of them will be first and second in the six-team block.
The first-placed team will avoid a longer encounter with the hard-hitting Dutch team, who won the second block.
Regardless of how Saturday's game goes, the Americans have already raised eyebrows over their surprising success in these games, four years after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first played field hockey at the age of three (his parents' twin sisters played in Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he didn't make the final roster.
Then came the 2012 races, where he and his team had little success.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as the coach, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical", says Bam.
"Our work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a complete reversal".
Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a near-clinch kick.
India had entered the game without winning a single tournament, but they proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent, maintaining a 1-0 lead until the third period, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long on the left side of the court, swerved to center field, hit the ball into the goal and took the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final touchdown in the middle of the fourth quarter.
It was the first game of the tournament in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep a clean sheet, and in the first three games, the Americans had been out on goal by one shot each.
Briggs is now living off his success,
And so is Bam.
"Our position is good now", says Parnham, "but how good depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
# In the middle of the Olympic foyer # # My trampoline is a thing #
No matter where or when, the Olympics are bound to happen.
The events, the competitions, and the struggles of Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a fervent message constantly and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming torch that passes from archer to swimmer, from swimmer to gymnast, and from gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation over coffee in line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian, is delighted with his smile and may well be the name on everyone's lips, the one who would be on the top of the news and the best of the world, the favorite of sponsors and the one who would be in good-natured TV commercials, if only he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for the Olympic gold medal in trampolining.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all the competitions equally.
Further out of the center, and partly in the shadows, are lesser-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, and taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and may we have the championship for a long time.
But if I may be permitted to write a humble account of my own particular favourite, I would like to call attention to the restrained allure of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility has been so low for the past 16 years that many people I have interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
The ignorance can be regional.
The United States has competed in the Olympic trampoline event, but the country never won a medal and did not advance to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to be going to the Chinese and the Russians, and in the women's side, the Canadians are the winners.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will defend this year's gold medals they won in London.
The trampoline, however, has a sub-optimal appeal, partly because to the uneducated ear it sounds more appropriate for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I confess that I am not an expert, but just a fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons to endlessly bounce off characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, which are essentially combined in trampolining.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning "trampoline".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline that lowers them to a height of nearly 30 feet [10 m].
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged on performance, difficulty and "flying time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete for the trampoline world championship.
The most common Olympic sport is straight forward.
To win the gold, the medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth across the field.
In addition to the goal line or the starting line, they have another goal that they strive for in their televised reports, namely, a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is lofty, admirable, even fanatical - and enough to make the onlooker shed tears.
But I also find this a little exhausting just watching the races.
This is where the trampoline provides a respite.
On the trampoline, the direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The booster will bounce up weightless like an astronaut, drop down, and effortlessly swing back up.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect to the sport, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a high-speed dash to the finish line or a long jump, only a dreamy and fluid combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as the Olympics can get.
The women's qualifying and finals are held on Friday afternoon, beginning at 1:00 p.m. local time, with the men's qualifying on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon broadcast, which will begin at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of the Olympian mania, they bring a moment of calm and beauty that might go unnoticed in the midst of the general commotion.
And if the only way to increase awareness is to offer attractive male athletes to watch and objectify them - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new crowd of fans to come cheering.
A whole generation is protesting in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed demonstrations for political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia in the process of breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months the country has been rocked by anti-government protests that are spreading to ever larger areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights groups have called the government's response "ruthless".
According to eyewitnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The videos, which are believed to be from protests at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show security forces beating young people with sticks, forcing them to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN's top human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving it forward is even harder", says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group of the African Horn Project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by Western countries.
The United States military and intelligence community are closely supporting the Ethiopians in their fight against terrorism throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has been growing at a rapid rate.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, with a new tram in the capital Addis Ababa.
City streets are usually quiet, safe, and clean.
The European Union is also calling on the European Union to take action to combat the illegal trade of arms and to provide a legal framework for the international community to deal with the issue.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But that may be changing.
"If a people is oppressed and has no choice but to speak out, it will come out", says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
"All the youth are showing their interest.
A whole generation is protesting".
The reasons for the discontent are many, ranging from land use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.
After last year's widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat previously held by the opposition, with the result that they now control the whole parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the Eritrean border, where a tense situation has led to hundreds of deaths in fighting in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to take advantage of the disorder and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitterness that has been hidden for years is erupting right now.
The first is the seemingly innocent: smartphones.
It is only in the last couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and internet access improved.
Even though the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many people still access the internet through proxies that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths told me that this was how they called people to demonstrations.
The second reason is the growing solidarity between the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amhara.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharas, who are from the predominantly Christian Ethiopian highlands, have long dominated the country's politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella", says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest protests have been in Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by a tribe of Tigers, who represent only about six percent of the population and yet control the military, intelligence, commerce, and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an unspecified illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactful genius who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting the first signs of discontent and using envoys to mediate between the two sides.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct", says conflict researcher Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes from near obscurity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he's not trusted by the security forces that run the Tiger tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced similar riots was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated against an election that analysts say was first rigged and then stolen by the government.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although the death toll was lower than in previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and for making significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment toward the Ethiopian government has clearly not been deterred from gaining ground.
And the resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amhara city of Gondar, tiger-owned businesses were attacked by protesters, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more prevalent on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft to monitor neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the US.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already fragile region to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance", says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of ISIS.
Donald J. Trump tried to backtrack on Friday in the latest controversy he's faced in his campaign by claiming that he wasn't serious when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to clearly communicate his message to the people of his country.
The situation is also fraught with his supporters, who must try to defend his candidacy in these stormy moments, and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at a campaign event on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he said that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted that the allegation was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted from the day before, in which he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest storm of criticism came as Trump tried to refocus his campaign back to the economy as his approval ratings plummeted.
Trump and Clinton are holding their economic policy keynote speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm in the past.
In late July, he came under widespread criticism for appearing to encourage Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email, later explaining his comments by saying, "Of course I was being sarcastic".
This is how Trump stretches the limits of political discourse and pulls back when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing out certain messages that will have a response from his supporters, watching how supporters react to messages and then 'clearing' one way or another depending on the reaction", says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his arguments and knows they are sufficiently circular to pass through different strains".
Instead of softening his rhetoric for the election crowd, Trump has in recent days changed his style to even more aggressive as his approval ratings continue to soar.
A new poll released Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist said Trump's approval ratings are significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida is strictly Republican.
While Trump generally avoids apologizing for his provocative remarks, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But after being subjected to increasing scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position of publicly defending Trump's comments, however provocative.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a reasoned, political speech", Giuliani said when asked if Trump was telling the truth when he said that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded ISIS.
"That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little-known, little organization that Obama called, completely wrongly, a 'lower-level team,' and that's why it was, because he pulled troops out of Iraq".
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, let ISIS continue its activities when it didn't take a strong stand in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of misrepresenting his speeches and discriminating against him.
He mocked "undignified and pathetic" television commentators who tried to get to know him but, he said, could not.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying it only made it more clear that he was unfit to be president.
The cafe that stopped opening in Greenpoint because of the unfair rent increase.
The Cafe was a little run-down coffee shop in Williamsburg, where Verb only paid in cash and didn't have Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe had to be priced out of its Bedford Avenue location when the rent rose beyond what was reasonable.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Café in the summer of 2014, sells soap bars in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals consider this a sad story about the loss of a café that had to be avoided by the middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB Club is gone, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap store".
But even if New York is not the same as it was, it's also creating something new.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and a credit card, but some of the staff are the same and the atmosphere is still uncluttered.
The coffee is still good too.
The new Verb Cafe is owned and operated by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old Verb Cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said that he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine.
Moreover, it even re-used the lamps of the old Verbe.
But Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
new products were added to the list.
There are bacon-chicken-egg-cheese sandwiches and capers and browned onion rings for the filling.
There's also a list of dark-currant beans.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but instead, juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of running the café, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regulars were starting to visit Verb in a steady stream.
"Many of our old clients were also priced out of Williamsburg", he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who came to the café a few Sundays ago.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and was a regular at Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walking tour of Verbi, then still in Williamsburg.
When the Verb was shut down, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found myself liking the Verbi coffee and the culture", he says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, although on that Sunday he had a chai tea mix instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also new on the list.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal Verb customer since 2003.
He used to stop by the coffee shop before work and order the same thing every time.
"I would enter the café every day at a quarter to seven, like a machine, and there they would make my waffles with all the fillings", she relates.
Rodriguez wanted to try something new too, and brought new items to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he changes his bagel to include bacon, chicken eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not holding a grudge because the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, made from Verbe's own cold-pressed coffee.
"We may still be able to take the offer", says Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish community in Greenpoint has also embraced the coffee.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez says he is now looking for a place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell the cafe's cold-pressed coffee.
The cafe might also expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to have their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular at Williamsburg, and he says it broke his heart when the cafe closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered coffee there, it was like coming home, says Whitt.
"I miss the smell of coffee".
The grim food of the Great Lakes in the new work, A Square Meal.
In March 1933, shortly after his inauguration as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his executive office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, a renowned chef, had a taste for the luxurious food of Fifth Avenue restaurants, including goose-liver pasties and Maryland turtle stew.
On that day, his menu was more modest: Devil's eggs in a tomato sauce, potatoes, and, for dessert, nut butter.
"It was a culinary show of solidarity with people who are suffering", says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat".
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, each work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of a Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a penthouse in the Lower East Side through the food.
Their new collaboration is A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesdays, which depicts the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their culinary solidarity by meeting with the supplier at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron Building that opened the same year as the Great Depression, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, ordered turkey, potatoes, and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a very large meal discussion.
"The maraschino was very popular", says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter and beans.
They were made of materials that were cheap and contentious.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that you have enough to eat for an entire meal".
Andrew Coe is a laughing stock.
"It must have been weighing on his stomach like lead", he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
The women prepared food for the farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which a nation coped when it was suddenly forced to give up its abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and pressing topic of conversation for Americans", says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally disturbing was the new low-cost diet: According to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as mules and patchouli became staple foods, and patchouli was said to be "a powerful way to tap food sources", as cooks could cover unattractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the centerpiece of the American diet, became a frugal luxury.
We tried strange concoctions that emphasized filling with calories and nutritional value rather than taste or even a healthy sense of cooking.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared a special meal of peanut butter-filled oven spoons.
"It didn't get a lot of attention at the dinner table", says Coe, who
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oatmeal are not a good match.
This was typical of many household recipes".
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, influenced the eating habits of the citizens in a way that was unprecedented and unique.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be strict budget-keepers and to take up the challenge of making tasty dishes from such snacks as carrot-and-egg pastry.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical tastings.
Especially tasty are accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked European cuisine, like fish and cucumber", says Coe.
"He ate in the nearly gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely disconnected from reality".
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared".
Many of the foods of the depression were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in the way we pay attention to calories and dietary intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
As they wrote the book, the couple said they began to understand better the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother, such as why she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid that the food would be thrown away", says Coe.
"People even began to feel sick of his food", recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one of the windmills".
After the main course was emptied at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out their homemade plum dessert, the same one President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum broth", says Ziegelman, adding that giving a fancy name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only berries, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
We reluctantly dipped our spoon into a thick brown puddle.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got the second and third.
"German walnuts would do better", Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget-maker.
Full compensation to Gilead for the attorney fees for the patent trial of the hepatitis C drug with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for legal fees incurred in a patent dispute with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. over a patent for a hepatitis C drug.
Gilead was exonerated in June of a $200 million judgment against it for infringing two Merck-owned patents relating to Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni success drugs, after a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of violations that included false widowing and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to relief from attorney fees incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the private ownership of sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs, which was undergoing laboratory work.
US-backed forces have captured the city of Manbij from ISIS.
US-backed forces have seized the town of Manjibin in northern Syria, near the border with Turkey, after the last ISIS fighters left the town, a military spokesman said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now searching the city for the last of the ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, a member of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages taken by ISIS fighters have been freed.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are still conducting search operations", said Darwish.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% in federal taxes.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, revealing that she and her husband had $10.75 million in income and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, most of it to the Clinton Foundation, with former President Bill Clinton earning nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announcing she earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster library, which dealt with her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be the model for financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, a campaign aide to Clinton, in a statement.
The exact opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and backtracks on promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax authority for an audit, citing it as the reason why Trump has not released his income data.
"The transfer is yours", tweeted Ian Sams, a Clinton campaign aide, referring to Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not let Trump release his tax returns until the audit is complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members of Congress, have said that his refusal to release the data raises questions about Trump's own wealth, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including his ties to Russia.
Clinton has taken up the issue and on Friday posted a video online showing prominent Republicans pressuring Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, Clinton brought up the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not to release his tax returns", Clinton told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted several tax lawyers and auditors as saying that the situation may remain the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has been a proponent of a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those making over a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama has also endorsed the proposal.
At the Clinton campaign rally in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway headquarters are in the same place, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both reveal their tax returns.
Buffet says he's also been under scrutiny by the IRS, and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, he's afraid of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns all the way back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in the town of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32% in federal real taxes between 2007 and 2014, and the actual corporate tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax returns show that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was payroll taxes.
Their main investment was a low-yield index fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Glow-in-the-dark condoms filled with chili pepper to support elephant conservation in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have devised an unusual method to keep elephants away from human habitation - by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The idea has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has partnered with the Nature Conservancy in the United States to launch a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we developed the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as villagers can now rely on their ability to keep elephants away from their fields without harming them", says Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, in a press release.
First, the intruding elephant is chased away by flashlight and horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw a "Chili-Chili" cloud.
Mixed with the soil, the chili powder is placed in the condom together with the spark plug, and then the condom head is closed so that only the spark plug is left out.
When the lighter is ignited, the condom explodes and releases a nice cloud of chili pepper into the air.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a projectile that shoots a firework, known as a Roman candle, into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab 'boasting'  RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent has sparked a media scandal after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel's phone number in its directory, prompting a hotel worker to point out that the "calls" from Arab customers were "inadequate".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust document Shoah, took out his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann was trying to find Israel in the directory provided by the hotel.
But it was not listed among the countries where you can call from a room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed - as if it never existed?"
Lanzmann is writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The director asked me to explain the whole thing to the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels".
The reason behind the measure shocked the film director even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli area code".
In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German ambassador to Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident "a great disgrace".
"This incident has shocked and appalled us all.
It's a great shame.
And it's all the more shameful when you consider that we're in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
No need to explain it any more.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the Internet, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the demands of its alleged Arab customers.
"A disaster", said one publication, pointing to the hotel's location near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the allegations, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"No direct order to remove Israel from the directory was ever issued", reports Suddeutsche Zeitung, quoting a Kempinski Hotel spokesman.
It adds that the code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian student protests
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement officials tried to break up the student mob, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students joined the protest, expressing their shock at the government's plans.
The governor of the state of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed an austerity measure that will close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters were graffitiing on the walls opposing the interim president Michel Temer.
The student protest came just days after the streets filled with protesters who had been expelled from the pro-President Dilma Rousseff rally after the Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 %  RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in doing business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
'Russian companies are continuing existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, increasing trade is one of the main objectives of cooperation between the two countries", says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015 and reached USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons", says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
'Last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in terms of tourism visited by its citizens in Russia.
And it is not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year", he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, and the ambassador hopes that this will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he says.
Scottishman Callum Skinner scored the winning goal as the British won the gold medal in cycling.
Callum Skinner of Scotland made a name for himself in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night as the British trio defended their 2012 title in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, was the anchor, a role he inherited from his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoyle, and he made the legend proud by scoring a goal and taking the win over the New Zealand team, which had been regarded as the favourites.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won five of her six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the feat after finishing sixth in the World Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since retired from competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who had specialized in the role of the first drawer.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoye's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Scottishman Skinner was a man that British coaches believed in and saw potential in, and he has now redeemed that.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the world championship with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in the time trial, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in the doubles.
Hindes was trailing by a hair after his round, but Kenny struggled to take the lead, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was the change in strategy, with Hindes driving at a higher gear to slow down, allowing Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed the BBC commentator from his seat and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped onto the awards ladder.
"I'm flattered by the comparison", says Skinner, 23, of Glasgow.
I'm just trying to do my best and be successful.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to beat it".
After winning London 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that they had deliberately crashed the track due to a poor start.
Later, he retracted his word, and British racing partners had no recourse.
This time, the sovereign victory was not associated with problems like this.
Hindes says: "It was like London, all the British flags flying in the background.
Our team has been building up a strong foundation over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great".
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten world championships in track cycling in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of the progress made in the last five months, we have five successful days on the Velodrome.
As Kenny has shown in his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's achievements and winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean a tally of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyt and also born on March 23 (the magical date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medal tally would be the same as it was for Hoyt.
Kenny will be competing in the next sprint, which begins today and finishes in three days.
"At the moment, I can only rejoice in this", says Kenny, 28, from Bolton.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the victory with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely".
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal event of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012 and winning gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will be contested on the second day of competition, and the center of attention will surely be Wiggins.
He had a fight with the race officials yesterday before the time trial when the reporters called him to measure his height.
In the women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record of 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its great cycling team to take charge of the mid-Olympic and bring home a stack of medals.
After the truly exceptional evidence from the full-scale demonstrations in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been some dramas, not the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of racing for major athletes like Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
But the races on the first night at the Velodrome show that the already legendary British reputation is once again being restored at the perfect time.
The future of the Portland smelter is at stake due to the expiration of the power contract
The future of an aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake after the electricity company supplying the smelter said that one of the plant owners was terminating the supply contract and that it was expected that all supply contracts would be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue the subsidies that keep the plant running.
The fixed 20 year grant expires in November.
The Alcoa plant in Portland is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
The closures may put up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to grow, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which forced the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland merger is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures reflect years of speculation about the future of the plant, first by the strength of the Australian dollar and more recently by the price of production at the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valleys, says it expects three other smelter owners to also terminate their contracts.
The majority shareholder is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with the minority shareholders being the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
AGL says that it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measures in question were necessary to restore the viability of the airport.
The contracts have a notice period of 12 months, which means that they expire in 2017.
The Commission also notes that the AGL is a subsidiary of the AGL.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts by $187 million in its books "in anticipation of termination of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts 'does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter'.
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November this year, although it has yet to clarify why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the weak financial situation of the industry, analysts have been cautious in their estimations of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
AGL's chief operating officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts earlier this week that on an annual basis, Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
'If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as producers, it would not be good news", says Mikkelsen.
Kendall, the Kardashian co-star of the television show, in the September cover photo of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and her mother and manager Kris, is pictured in the famous September issue of American Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and has been featured in fashion shows in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Watching the duck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted video in which all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar-pimps Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) appeared to have forgotten their sister's cover.
The plot is a cliché, used in almost all the birthday episodes of the children's programs (Seacrest says the words, "Did you think we forgot you?" as sincerely as a cartoon character on children's morning TV), but Kris had to somehow get her other daughters involved in this publicity.
Because appearing in the September issue of Vogue is undeniably the beginning of a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have graced the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is the best-selling Vogue publication of the year.
The issue, which resembles a magazine with a larger cover than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website Fashion estimated that last year's 832-page issue had 615 pages of advertisements).
The anticipation of the cover of the September issue is so great that for the past two years, the magazine's pictures have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous September cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more celebrity-model-working than celebrity-model-working.
Oscar-winning Dior model Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and Lady Gaga took the honor a year later.
The magazine describes Jenner as the supermodel of her generation, and while she's more of a celebrity model, she's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars or modern-day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of those things).
They can rightly be called talented women who excel in the entertainment business.
Beyonce, who was on the cover last year, is coming off one of the strongest years of her career, the release of her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner's place in the fashion world will always be a bit of a pain.
In June, Victoria's Secret original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid by calling them "narcissists".
These feelings have been reignited by the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But the constant nagging of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
She's the face of Estee Lauder's makeup and lotions.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's doing reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year .
Each year, more than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable people are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in funding will have on already marginalised centres.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people who seek free legal aid and legal counsel are turned away - most of them elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and similar injustices against those who struggle without resources.
The public legal services, already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
Starting next June, legal aid centers are at risk of losing an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
According to the latest census report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centers, thousands of people are already being turned away from the centers each year, says James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Center.
If the federal government doesn't change its mind, Farrell says it's only going to get worse.
"The Queensland public legal aid services are continually underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away when they seek out the essential services they need", says Farrell.
"People who leave violent relationships, people who are under an unmanageable and crippling burden of debt, families who are separating, workers who are being unjustly fired - all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government is planning to cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal issues without help.
We are calling on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately end these funding cuts so that people can get the legal help they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to take account of the needs of public legal aid centres and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work".
The Donald Trump campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was sued after allegedly not taking action after being told that a North Carolina campaign manager had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte County District Court by former state campaign software instructor Vincent Bordini.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be addressed internally in the campaign before, in his own words, realizing that it was not going to happen.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Bordini says that campaign manager Earl Phillip "took out his gun, put his right forefinger on the trigger and put the barrel against Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, after making a complaint campaign to the local and regional leadership, Bordini was informed that at least four other people had had the same experience as Phillip.
"Even if the gun doesn't fire, it causes damage", says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a public uproar by telling a crowd in North Carolina that "second amendment supporters" - who are considered gun owners and gun owners - could take action if her opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose the justices.
Trump campaign officials say the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not verbally incite violence.
Mr. Bordini's lawsuit is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent conduct and from Mr. Phillip for assault, battery and emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking for comment.
Despite all our efforts, we were unable to reach Phillip.
Charlotte's local news outlet, WCCB, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been campaigning in a controversial way.
The Commission has not identified any other party to the investigation that has come forward with a claim to the benefit of the Commission's findings.
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow is also a catalyst for economic growth and prosperity - not just in local communities and in London, but across the country.
For me, this was the thing that most interested me about Heathrow, and like the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the fact that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we're doing it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new learning places and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As in the London 2012 Olympics, there are always those who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too much of a challenge.
As for the Olympics, I was told that Britain would never be ready for them and that we would be embarrassed in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles to overcome will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits the many, not the few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, bringing skills and jobs to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have delivered on time and on budget an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, which included Terminal T5 - voted the best airport terminal of the year for two consecutive years - and Terminal T2, which was built between two of the world's busiest air routes.
Now they're ready to produce a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be a great success too.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can secure the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Secretary of State for Trade.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocking in the cat and mouse game
The efforts of companies that make money from online advertising to mislead anti-advertising software have become a cat-and-mouse game, says one anti-advertising firm.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blockers, Adblock Plus published a blog post, saying that users could update their ad blockers' filters to block ads on the community service again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it was changing the labeling of its desktop ads to make it harder for ad testers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock is saying they've cracked the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of ball-playing between the open source ad community and the scammers has been going on since ad testing was invented" and that it's possible that Facebook will soon be making its own corrections again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how much concern the advertisers have become in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, a figure that has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook has 1.03 million daily active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company will focus on the disguise of ad blocking programs in its desktop app, as the spokesperson said that mobile ad blocking programs do not work in Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop advertising is still sufficiently high and Facebook considered the investment to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update its advertising tool for user settings to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also block the view of some of its regular Facebook posts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we're going to fix the problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
"Adware is clunky and ineffective, and that's why we've invested in developing user-defined settings like advertising tools instead, so people can control how they target their ads".
A woman committed suicide by throwing herself under cars on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses in the aftermath of an accident on a highway Thursday in the early hours of the morning, in which a woman deliberately ran herself under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
"A woman who was desperate for help, lying on a dark road, was hit by several cars", says a statement from the Vaud police.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her apparent suicide attempt was accompanied by a truck.
She died at the scene.
Police have interviewed many of the motorists involved in the accident, but some are still unidentified, and are asking them or any other witnesses to come forward.
The lawyer, Gilles Hofstetter, told the newspaper Le Tribune de Genève that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Was the collision unavoidable?
It's up to the prosecutor to find out", says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where drivers are not held liable.
In both cases, the newspaper reported, the person was walking on a dark highway, and the court ruled that motorists could not expect to bump into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was acquitted of charges brought against him for causing death by dangerous driving after he ran into a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a large amount of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court held that the driving of the police officer who was responding to the emergency call was justified and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unforeseen situation".
Anyone with any information about the accident near Morges on Thursday, please call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus has been habitable for thousands of years
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been habitable for a long time.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model that allows the study of the past of Venus to be done using the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus could have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on its surface and its atmosphere is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously speculated that Venus' slow rotation is due to its thick atmosphere of gas.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus once had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth's, yet it has been slow to rotate.
The model was also used to determine the early surface structure of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry land than Earth, but it may have had enough water and geographical diversity to sustain life and prevent rapid decay.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model, Venus rotates slowly and has a diurnal phase relative to the Sun for almost two months at a time", explains Anthony Del Genio, a GISS researcher, in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella, shielding the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average temperatures in the atmosphere are even a few degrees below present-day Earth's temperatures.
The model created a history of Venus that matches the planetary scientists' previous assumptions about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for many billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
As the water rushed into space, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus as it is today.
The scientists reported the results of the new Venus climate modeling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is resigning as head coach of the Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of hockey operations, citing a lack of influence over team decision-making.
Colorado Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the team will begin recruiting new coaches immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been doing my job as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of hockey operations with energy, passion and determination", says 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
"During the summer I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and the vice-president of club hockey operations must be in full alignment with the organisation.
He also has to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not met at present.'
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today", Sakic says.
"We are grateful for all that he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future".
Royle was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's coach of the year in his first season as Avalanche's head coach in 2013-14.
Under his leadership, the team scored 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made the postseason in the last two years.
The Avalanche finished 39-39-4 in the 2015-16 season, and were five points behind the Minnesota Wild for the second Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say the strike in the North Sea oil workers will be stopped when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against Wood Group, an oilfield services company, on drilling platforms in the North Sea, owned by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to re-start the process to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week we will have a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will be dealing with the problems from a fresh perspective.
The unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group will cut approximately 9% of the tariffs of its contractors operating in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with the 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the country in 20114.
The company claims that the additional cuts will give it the room to maneuver that it needs to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries, in a bid to streamline its operations following its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour crises experienced in the North Sea for a generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits the many, not just the few", says Anderson.
The total amount of new projects in the North Sea is expected to be less than USD 1.4 billion in 2016, compared to some USD 7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler is measuring the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades galaxy.
The most recent mission of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the rotation rates of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive catalogue of rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades constellation to date.
With this new information, astronomers are able to explain why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how the orbits relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with those of other galaxies, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass and age of a star and even about the history of the solar system", says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at Caltech in Pasadena, California, in a press release.
The Pleiades are located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the galaxy were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching adulthood.
They're spinning faster than ever right now.
At their peak, the adult stars emit large amounts of stellar fire.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they pass through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of identifiable stellar dots (which are similar to sunspots).
The latest data on the rotation rate suggest that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers. The larger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiades' 'dance' that the slow-spinning ones are typically larger, while the fastest-spinning ones are typically very light stars", says Rebull.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they serve as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars relative to their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a foundation for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars", says Rebull.
We still want to know much more about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop "dancing".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotation rates in three new papers that will be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
