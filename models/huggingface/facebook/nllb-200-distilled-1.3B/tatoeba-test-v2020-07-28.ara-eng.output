Can I go with him?
Go ahead.

Swimming is prohibited.
Sammy's office had a couch.
It sounded crazy.

The elephant has a long nose.
Sami was upset.
Sami beat Layla and knocked her unconscious.
All the teachers were here.
That's her shoe.
When the wind blew, the candle went out.
Sami has made a decision and no one can force him to compromise.
It's a fake.
Don't you remember him?
Tom is waiting for a response.
The sunshine covered the hills.
Sami was subject to eternal judgment.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I can send you my Amazigh dictionary.
Tom doesn't sing anymore.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever said.
Fadil went to a public college in Philadelphia.
We have no choice but to continue.
Can you suggest a good place to eat Korean food?

I don't want him to know the truth.
He wasn't my teacher.

I'm from Australia.
We know that the sun is bigger than the earth.
I don't feel so good today.
Actually, that's why I'm here.
Thanks for coming.

My parents confused me.
Fadil lived on Sadik Street.
Which car is Tom's?
Most of the leaves have fallen.
The hospital opened last month.

They're talking about this and that.
I have an Italian neighbor.
Sami went on vacation.
Say hello to your turd.
I'm going to shoot him.
Where was Tom born?
Israel knows what they're gonna do to the West Bank, but they don't seem to know what they're gonna do to Gaza.
She's holding something.
I go to school by bus.
It doesn't work.
Sami wanted to make Layla love him.
The book is here.
Sami came closer.
"Tatoeba" means "for example" in Japanese.
I think he's right.
Have someone else do it, please.
The Japanese like to travel in groups.
Wait for me in my office.
I see what you mean.
We were just talking.
Let's have a look.
You're in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was wearing a blue jacket.
The police have collected a lot of evidence from the crime scene.
Maybe he was sick.
It doesn't matter where it came from.
What do you think you're doing?
You got me?
This is my fault.
Tom likes to go out .
Sami's fate is now in the hands of the jury.
Nancy looked like she was exhausted.
You can waste ten logs.
Just 15 minutes.
This is the window that broke.
Tom's little grill with a spoon on Mary.
We discussed the plan with him.
What did you major in at the university?
Don't say anything without thinking it through.

Let's split the expense.
I hope to see you again.
We don't have to do this every day.
Sami's car hit a bus stop.
I have a cat and a dog.
Layla will be brought to justice.
As in heaven, so on earth.
Eder is my favorite Amazigh singer.
Did the cat eat your tongue?
I yelled at the school.
See you later.
What does "get" mean in this sentence?
I walk every day.
"But don't you think it's a little too big?"
Why are you being so rude?
Layla has given up on Sami.

I have a good job now.
Is anyone watching?
Thank you very much, Doctor.
I have to tell Jamal what I heard.

She 's become rich .
I'll try not to disturb you while you study.
You should go back.
And say, 'The truth is from your Lord.' So let him believe who will, and let him disbelieve who will.
Sami disrespected Layla.
Fadil knew the police could be here any minute.
Where's the British embassy?
Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
Does this dog bite?
It's a good club, Danielle.
Sami was serving a life sentence.
She put the magazine on the table.
Sami called Layla, asked her to come and pick him up.
Sami never feels comfortable.
Sami offered the police to tell them everything he knows.
How far is the park from your house?
This is my house.
Thanks for the heads up.
Let's get ready to go.
Sami looked down.

A drug dealer was arrested at the airport.
Did you see that, Jamal?
I use Twitter.
Give me your credit card, please.

It could take a while.
I remember seeing her once on the road.
He knows.
They're gay.
When did the meeting end?
The thick fog made it difficult to see the road.
Take your time, Yoshida.
It wasn't her!
She told me not to touch me.
Sami came to the clinic to meet Layla.
I better ask her.
Mariko speaks English fluently.
I don't care what other people say.

What about you?
That's not a white candle.
Yesterday was my birthday.

We ate a whole load of apples.
The grass needs pruning.
Show me how it works.
Anyway, that's not the point.
May I ask, where are you going?
It's Tom's turtle. Her name is Mary.
I hope summer never ends.
Sami wanted Layla to give him more money.
Do you speak English?
Sami has no right to do this.
All her cats are sitting on the roof of her car.
Sami was tied to a hospital bed.
I'm glad to hear your voice.

I want to buy.
I went to the wrong address.
I don 't have more than 1,000 yen .

You might have to fire her.
The hand has five fingers.
We can't wait for dinner.
I'm not swimming in this lake.
Not every question is worth answering.
Sami was confused.
Who stole the apple?
I'm sure it will.
Did you talk to me?

What did you come here for?
Layla stopped at a grocery store at a gas station.
Sami met a Muslim woman on the Internet.
Do your own thing.
This is gonna be a very dangerous mission.

You came alone?
I was thinking about getting a dog.
Sami and Layla were planning to spend the weekend together.
She said she was 20 years old, but that's not true.
Get out of here!
He's such a bad guy that everyone hates him.
We can't live a life like this.
We have to work while we live.
Where did he get this sweater?
It's not easy living with Tom.
Sami will give Layla some medicine.
He could have been worse.
Sami was borrowing money from his company all the time.
You better take the bus.
She's not the right girl for you.
Who's that boy swimming over there?
Sami changed the subject.
Tom was buying a special thing for Mary for her birthday.
Tom likes Mary's new hairstyle.

Environmentally harmful projects should be systematically cancelled.
Who wants to do this?
On your way.

That's how it worked.
Sami is very scared.
He'll have to forget you.
Sami lived a glamorous life.
A generous new teacher.
He's right next to me.
Sami must have been scared.
The doctor will be here any minute.
Let me ask you a question.
Layla was asleep in her bedroom.
Arabic is not difficult.
What a big dog.
I think I need to talk to Tom.
Sami's wife left.
The Sahib said, "Yes, that's me, but there's at least one of us in every country. And we all love the Vanta, and we like to put the beginners to their limits".
Sami was playing a very dangerous game.
That's Tony's book.
Fadel lived the life of his dreams for seven years.
Tom thinks Mary won't say yes.
Sami has to eat.
Take a shower, please.
Fadil wanted to cremate Layla.
He became president of the company at 30.

Since Mario lied to me, I haven't talked to him.
We encourage your contribution.
I'm too fat.
Not necessarily.
Tom's hair is really short.
Sami suffered several serious injuries to his body.
Sami regrets it.
I'm not old enough to get a driver's license.
Please don't talk about me while I'm gone.

Fadel told the police everything.
Tom wiped the table.
Peter looks young.
Who's Tom's son?
That's why I went out.
Move the table outside, please.
I know your mother.
Fuck you.
I love her like a sister.
There's so much I want to tell you.
You must have been scared.
Sami is waiting outside.
Sami had another woman in his life.
Sami was in danger.
Change is the only thing that stays constant.
I can't forget the day I met him.
I'm leaving for America tomorrow.
Remember your promise.
I could have a lot of fun playing alone.
What are you looking at?
He's listening to a shortwave radio station.
He works at the bank.

I think we should do more.
We thought it was normal to be punished.
What's your favorite band?
They look American.
I advise you not to go with Tom.

I should have done this a long time ago.
You just miss her.
I haven't actually eaten anything since this morning.
Sami fell in love with a Muslim girl named Layla.
I call you, hear my voice.
She asks how that's possible.
It is a remarkable fact that men often write good poems under the influence of emotion, which they could not do under other circumstances.
We got a call from school today.
He decided to keep his plan a secret.
Layla shot Sami to save her life.
Sami is ready to go.
I was wondering when you'd be back.
This book is hard to understand .
Is that your son, Betty?
Layla was busy.
Don't worry, I'll do it for you.
There's nothing to be proud of.
Sami watched Layla suffer.
Where's my car?
Please help me.
We met our teacher.
Let's take a break.

Can you sing the Argentine national anthem?
I'm a substitute teacher.
Trust no one but yourself.
This is Tony's book.
Doesn't that bother you?
What's the purpose of your trip?
Where are you going? - I'm going.
The boy stayed quiet.
They don't pay any attention to me.
You need to control your delusions.
Tom has always had that problem.
The program will end with the national anthem .
I'm going back to work to make some money.
I'm telling you the truth.
Sami was sound asleep.

I'm cold.
She hated her math teacher.
