The city of Juankosken joins the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
The Juankosken City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the association, but its council decided that Tuusniemi should continue as an independent municipality.
The following municipal elections will be decided separately by Kuopio and Juankoski.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
Since the accession of the Republic of Kosovo, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian forces are shooting at civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership of Kiev does not want to engage in a meaningful political dialogue with the east of the country, Putin said, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are supported by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian military forces were shooting at civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push these armed forces and their artillery away so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Rhythm Section.
I was surprised to see the crowd come in early.
The event was expected to attract visitors over the next two days, promoter Tom Kangas said.
The Wall River Hip Hop Festival was held for the third time.
I'll do it again next year.
We're still going to be hip-hop festivals, so no pop is allowed, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law restricting the procurement of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Government for permission to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances are hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the concentration limits are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in cleaning and washing products, but the levels in these products are generally not above the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration cycles.
However, starting materials obtained before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is accused of the Nairn and Pitlochry hotel rapes.
The accused in the two hotel rapes are awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, was arraigned at the High Court of Justice in Glasgow.
He is accused of a rape which took place at the Pitlochry Scotlands Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman while she was unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision for herself.
Webster is also accused of a second rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the order of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November at the High Court of Justice in Edinburgh.
Super Raheem is a star Mario has been overshadowed by Super League
At just 19 years old, Raheem Sterling has once again shown why he is seen as the future of English football.
White Hart Lane was electrified on Sunday as Mario Balotelli-built Liverpool arrived for a visit from Tottenham.
The Super Marion's debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than in his Manchester City days.
Balotelli was still far from peak power.
The Italian lost three quality goal positions and only gave half of his 16 innings to his own team.
The pool fans who already love the player expect more in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has installed Balotelli as Luis Suarez, who has moved to Barcelona, as the team's second striker, alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team, replacing Balotelli, was the top midfield diamond, Raheem Sterling, who smashed past the key opening goal of the 3-0 win over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, is not just a powerhouse.
An Englishman less than eight inches tall is like a fish in water between the lines.
This is not a common feature for a player who can hit a top speed of about 21 miles per hour.
Rodgers also deserves a lot of credit for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irishman told us after the game how Liverpool have systematically developed a player more versatile than a midfielder from a North West London boy who grew up at Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected principal cellist of the Helsinki City Orchestra.
The City of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next principal cellist of the Helsinki City Orchestra, starting in autumn 2016.
Newspapers ranging from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times have asked which orchestra he'll take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start her new assignment happy and proud.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the musical life of our country for over a hundred years, including performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the finest Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation", he says.

- What?
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball team stumbled into the league champion Vampula Athletes in the final of the Pihtiputai training tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula went on to win the game 3-2 after five innings.
Last round, WoVo lost 15 to 11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in defense and passing Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
The WoV's hexagon was so large that the 6'2" American Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the side with her back.
Sara Niemi played center.
Despite her thumb injury, she was able to play and formed the most powerful combination with Johanna Pekkarisen at WoV.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a batter, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 innings.
The best part of the vamp was the skilled Russian pimp and the lib libelist Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo circled as much as possible.
WoV's preparations for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinnan HPK will arrive at training camp in Rovaniemi.
The teams will meet at the dealer's on Saturday at 6:00 p.m. for an official practice game.
We're gonna have a rematch at the gym on Sunday.
Lidl is hitting the big numbers in Finland .
The company's sales in Finland increased by almost 25% to almost EUR 1,2 billion in the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company released its earnings data on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland and plans to continue its expansion.
Lidl also reported that it paid almost EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland in the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company employs over 4 200 people in Finland.
Ovarian cancer deaths are higher in sparsely populated areas because of late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In rural Australia, women are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent survived more than five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
Smaller research: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through the women's health records for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, history, and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
Older women with more widespread cancer had the lowest survival rate at diagnosis.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not investigate why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan cites delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
Gynecological oncology specialists are the best treatments for this disease, and their clinics are mostly in major cities, says Jordan.
While telemedicine is becoming more common and distance is decreasing in importance, the researcher also proposes increasing the mobility of doctors to treat patients closer to home, as well as programmes to support patients treated remotely.
Dr. Jordan's study found that long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are poor regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by the charity Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neavel, a 33-year-old mother in the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the operation of the skate park in the Friendship Park, located next to the hotel Pohjanhov, with a station plan.
The city council decided on Monday that the proposed station plan for the Friendship Park and its surroundings would be placed on public display at the service point in Osviitta.
The draft plan is subject to a request for comments from the Environment Committee and the Lapland Environment Centre.
The change in the station plan is intended to allow the continuation of motor racing activities in the area, which are linked to tourism.
The site is to be developed into a park area that includes the present Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
The proposal provides for a maximum of 200 motor sails to be permanently available on site between 15 November and 30 April.
Fuel stations may also be located in a designated part of the area.
The new park area will also be open to service traffic.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for motor racing in winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
The sledding operation and the change in format have aroused even loud opposition.
Residents of the neighboring buildings have been plagued by noise and concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied and no findings have been made that go beyond the guidelines.
The renewed furniture is also lower in emissions than the old one.
The park is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, hotel safari guests would have to be transported to the starting points of the safaris by buses, which would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
The area and surroundings of the Friendship Park are also sufficiently large for the slopes, better than the places presented as replacement starting places, such as the pier column on the east side of the Ounas River bridges.
The Friendship Park is also well situated, as it will be possible to expand activities in the future, for example to the Ounas Pavilion area.
The establishment of the park is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, which aims to create a good business environment by providing adequate quality areas for locations that are logistically and functionally advantageous.
The park is also listed as the starting point for motor racing in the city's share plan, which has not yet become law.
The decline in ownership is reflected in the garden shops
The decline in homeownership, especially among the under-35s, may lead to a decline in garden shop turnover of tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the "target group" of gardeners by their mid-life.
According to a report in the Financial Times, apartment tenants spend only 55 percent of the money that homeowners spend on gardening.
The study also found that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens, and that the size of the garden is shrinking as the front yard is increasingly paved over to a parking lot, also threatening the garden area, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion a year.
In the greater London area, homeownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years and has the lowest per capita expenditure on garden products in the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Horticultural Society (RHS), the increase in rental housing or the decrease in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow crops.
Guy Barter, the RHS's senior gardening adviser, says that for example, plants grown in portable growing containers are particularly popular with apartment tenants because such containers can be incorporated into the move if necessary.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a boom in garden retail, as home ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year, thanks to better weather conditions, which are worse than those of March and April last year.
Turkey is interrogating an American diplomat over a spy report .
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy's case manager and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept report that leaked documents by Edward Snowden, a former analyst for the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was a prime target for U.S. and British intelligence.
Turkish news agencies reported that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the report's significance, saying that all major powers were spying on each other.
An earlier report on German intelligence spying on Ankara provoked a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to star in new Finnish animated film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been cast in the female lead in a new Finnish animated film.
Croze will play director Mikko Kuparinen in the movie 2am, which starts shooting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in the 2003 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
She has appeared in films including Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's Butterfly in the Glass Picture.
The male lead in the movie "Two in the Morning" is Mikko Rosianin.
The film will be released in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calviàn city officials at the Mallorcan prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of the resort island of Mallorca, Calviàn, has been arrested following allegations of corruption by the owners of shops and bars in the Magaluf region, known for its humid festivities.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several businessmen on Punta Ballena Street, where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calviàn city officials at the Mallorcan anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were angry about the bias of the authorities, which made it difficult for them to operate.
It is no longer about money, it is about survival, one business owner told the court.
You're not gonna destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video was posted online showing an 18-year-old British vacationer performing oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrollable behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-fuelled pub crawl.
The Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was also ordered to close for a year and the nightclub owner and the pub crawler Carnaghe were jointly fined EUR 55 000.
The popular tourist destination of Magaluf, especially among young British tourists, has also become a popular destination for the so-called balconing trend, which has led to a number of alcohol-related accidents involving people jumping from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters after rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket fire in the communities of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashosh, workers removed fragments from walls and slippery areas before children arrived after a rocket hit the day care center.
'We are a little scared but also excited,' says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area are in dire need of routines.
Shani Bart, Bart's 11-year-old daughter, feels that going back to school after a long time feels "a little weird".
We have had difficult times when we have not left home, she says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire began last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas farther from Gaza to escape the rocket and grenade fire.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are skeptical about returning after a Palestinian shell killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, as many as ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that their education and safety would be taken care of.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted fighting but did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' demands for the lifting of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disputed the death toll, saying at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5,000 demonstrations and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, school officials moved the start of school last week.
"I hope that schools will open soon and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old shelter student at a school in Gaza City.
According to a commonly used measure, the highest increase in house prices in seven years has occurred during the winter months in Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures house prices in the Australian capital, rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
The increase in prices in June, July and August was accompanied by a total increase of 4.2%, higher than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily throughout the country.
According to Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are leading the way in price increases.
The results of RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% and in Melbourne by 11.7% over the previous year.
The next busiest housing markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, with average house price increases of five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, a real test for the housing market.
Given the increase in sales of homes for sale at auction, the generally buoyant sales and the continued low interest rate, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months, says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record numbers of visitors to Mantua
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences to Mantua this summer.
The Serlachius Art Museum has had over 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured pop art classics by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
The Mäntä visual arts week reported on Monday that it had set a record number of visitors, with 14,500 people attending the Moment event this summer.
I'm not used to numbers like this.
People have been swept out of doors and windows", says director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will approach 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
The population of Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, is about 11 000.
Museum director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make it permanent", he says.
The hope is that the art season will continue well beyond the summer.
In the autumn, the art museum will open new exhibitions.
Police are investigating a string of robberies in the last four days in Kajaan.
On Sunday night, a window was broken into a commercial building on North Street.
The unsub said he had taken a small amount of cash from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, a truck was robbed of fuel from its tank on Deep River Road.
Between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its engines were removed from the port of Petennissiska.
The rowboat was a Pisces-designed light-colored outer and yellowish inside.
The inside of the case had the words "OIVA" written on the tip.
The police have already gotten a couple of suspects in custody.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into on Ladder Road.
The police got a trace, and a 20-year-old arsonist was found hiding in the woods under a bush.
On Monday, police arrested another man in Paltamos, who is also suspected of the same burglary.
The missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Cayenne.
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine brought a murder charge against a Caiaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone into the apartment with his partner and another man and shot the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old woman from Kainan, with a shotgun, whom he suspected of being a drug smuggler.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that he was accompanied by another man as the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car with a group of people burning clothes used in the bloodbath.
In addition to the burned clothing, the car was found to contain a severed shotgun.
The Kainu District Court will rule on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the National Weather Service, an August this warm occurs on average once every ten years.
The National Weather Service reports that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
The warmth of July and August made the whole summer warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the entire summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, where the temperature was 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never wanted me".
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a family of seven Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, in the British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father, who worked in a factory, died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently training for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, based in part on a fictional conversation he had with his father, which was developed from a Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap in an upbeat style.
Henry's been going through some painful childhood memories.
She's been in therapy a lot since her mother died, and she's been thinking a lot about her relationship with her father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
I never saw his face, only the voice saying, "Stop the noise".
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, would visit my father at the pub and discuss such things as the shape of a beer bottle or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metalworking factory in Dudley, and this gave him a glimpse of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than then.
The melting pot is now a little brighter, but it's basically a dark, smoky, labyrinthine abyss, bursting with flames, smoke and soot, reminiscent of the underworld.
My father used to go to the bathroom and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the dirt off the smelter.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing this work for years to get food on the table for us, and I came to appreciate him more.
Yet, Henry's childhood was lacking the closeness his parents provided.
My father never cried, never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother became ill shortly before she died that we began to tell each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, he has been able to share the love that he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
I'm with Dawn French.
Why can't we be friends?
She 's a great mom .
Henry is still good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why can't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother's death.
When I began to suffer from severe overweight and diabetes, my doctor ordered a complete reversal.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce my symptoms.
It 's very difficult .
and boring.
No one likes eating carrots.
Henry's famously short beard may reflect his change in career progression.
After receiving much positive critical acclaim for her performance as Othello, she has devoted herself to theatre.
Next up was the comedy of errors and August Wilson's Fences.
Doing theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was just 16 years old, working in a factory.
A dishwasher spotted her on stage doing a number on the New Faces talent show.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on television", he says.
Henry learned his trade.
I had to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn to produce jokes on the treadmill from 1975 to 1985, while living the life of a star and being on television.
Lenny at the 1975 New Faces competition.
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show in which characters appeared in black make-up, so Henry ended up on the show as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been a part of it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and disgusting, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet the award-winning, longtime favourite light entertainment programme on British television was also a "decent parody of black people".
Henry worked on another comedy series in the '80s that both mocked and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s, Henry was known for his role as chef Gareth Blacklock on the sitcom Chef!
Henry spent the next decade working on commercials, documentaries, TV series and film scenes, but after his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len?
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series What's So Great About...?
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wear socks and have money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme scared me.
Everyone we interviewed on the show -- Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench -- they all said to me, "Try it.
Don't give up on the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me was missing before, and now it was being put back together.
That's the point, this is important, so take it seriously, study your verse, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was hard, and I read the play for months before it was performed.
The play was a success in the end.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't quite.
Soon after, Henry was cast in the lead role of the comedy "Mistakes".
Suddenly I was performing at the National Theatre of Great Britain, and I couldn't quite believe it.
And at one point, I thought, "Wow, you've changed".
Once, there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
A little voice in my head said to me, "You have to do this alone for 10 minutes until the computer works again".
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me was sighing with relief.
It's not my responsibility,
I can leave it to others to handle.
You're part of the play, stay in your role.
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words to the play "Fences" was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing. It makes you more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; This is what you should do.
Henry says that, of course, in a COULD voice.
I mean, I decided to stick with this.
I truly love this job.
I love the practice rooms.
But Henry is still a comedian at heart: little comedians constantly interrupt our conversation as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, for it seems dangerous to receive immediate praise from an unknown audience.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when I feel like it, but generally, it doesn't excite me as much as it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
I find it a real pleasure to sit with a guide who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the entire journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so, yeah.
I like acting.
It's really fun.
It's a story that's always being told in a play, and that's what I love about it.
I love stories. I know.
People love stories.
Kenya to set up a civil service register to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun compiling biometric records of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payroll.
Workers who fail to register within the next two weeks will no longer receive their wages, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still being paid after they leave office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to stamp out corruption in the public sector when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million a month was spent on "ghost workers"' wages and other financial abuse.
The government suspects that salaries are paid into the account even after a person has died or left office, reports the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will be required to register at identification centres in the coming weeks to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration form, the government statement said.
The release states that anyone who fails to do so without proper cause will be removed from the payroll.
This measure will significantly streamline the public sector by defining the number of people actually working in their jobs. It will also clean up payroll at both levels of government. It will solve the hamo workers problem, says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official in the Ministry for Decentralisation and Planning.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Belgian authorities on the measures taken by the Belgian authorities to comply with the restructuring plan.
The current budgetary preparation shows that the annual budget deficit is likely to be around 9,4 million.
Possible means of improving efficiency were the reduction of the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale and subsidisation of assets and the increase of tax and tax revenues.
The total investment target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no guarantee that the situation in the municipalities will improve.
New obligations on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in state contributions further undermine the outlook.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The city council is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be converted into a strategic target, says Kimmo Heinonen, chairman of the city council.
The city government returned the presentations to the management team for preparation.
The proposals of the city council will form the basis for the budgetary preparation at the council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal moves through the municipal council to the city government and the city council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of plotting against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots", local media sources report.
Police were not immediately available for comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police were linked to corruption investigations last December targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) said the police action was part of a plan by Islamist leader Fethullah Gulen against him and others in power.
Not all children in Ukraine go back to school
Most Ukrainian schools opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he is committed to defending the country for future generations:
The September 1st ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the head teacher at the Slavic school where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke Russian.
It is our hope that peace will finally return here and that the children will be able to receive an education that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school celebrations traditionally include children's engraved shirts, balloons, and flowers given to teachers.
Perry, Texas, said the abusive tweet was unauthorized.
A confirmed Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry posted a derogatory photo Sunday night of the Democratic district attorney as he was hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
I do not approve the tweet and have removed it, the later post said.
Perry's rearguard did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a derogatory photo of Travis's District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury in Austin this month, with Perry being indicted.
The tweet headline read: "I don't always drive drunk, three times the legal limit... but when it does, I accuse Governor Perry of pointing the finger".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Agency wasn't the lead agency in the grand jury investigation into Perry.
The investigation was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has always maintained his innocence and called the charges a political plot.
His powerful legal team has asked the presiding judge to drop the charges, saying the law that would have indicted Texas' longest-serving governor is unclear in light of the constitutionality of the law.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to the state's public safety unit that operates in Travis County and handles public sector prosecutions after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry's verified Twitter account is updated regularly  and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to break the tie by posting a picture of himself running on a lake on Twitter with the caption "Here Comes South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is back to normal .
One of London's leading developers has warned that the housing market in the south-east of England has "returned" to normal activity.
London's capital has been plagued by huge housing demand and a sharp rise in prices, along with fears of a widespread credit bubble that prompted the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-end builder Berkeley, said on Monday that since the start of this financial year, the market and trading volume have returned to normal after the 2013 peak, adding that this has allowed for a stable operating environment.
London's housing market did well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to the Land Register, house prices in the city rose 18.5 percent in the previous year alone, well above the 6.7 percent average in England and Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthening pound has made London a less attractive destination for property in recent months, partly due to new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "cart tax" ahead of the May general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which announced tighter borrowing regulations, would lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent Bank of England data on Monday showed that the number of loans approved declined in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate broker Hamptons International has cut its forecast for 2015 for London property prices by three percent as the index of homeowners' opinion of prices has already started to weaken.
The number of deals in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington fell in the quarter from a year ago, says real estate agent W. A. Ellis.
However, the demand for housing in the capital has been a blessing to Berkeley, which has increased its real estate revenues to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that demand for the right product, well designed, in the best locations has remained stable and sales have therefore remained buoyant.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to April, almost a third more than at its peak before the financial crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% year-on-year to GBP 380 million and turnover increased by 18% to GBP 1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the full year's pre-tax profit is £450 million.
Berkeley stock was trading steadily at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
A hacker leaked naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence to the Internet .
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have 100 photos of other stars leaked nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
The star of The Hunger Games confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "grossly violating privacy".
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts photos of Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The photos, which were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to a vulnerability in Apple's iCloud storage system.The list of 100 other hacked stars allegedly includes dozens of other female stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not known how much of the footage is real, although Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
To those of you who are looking at pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you are in a good mood, Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickelodeon's iCarly and Victorious series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that these so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, don't you get it?
Let me finish this right from the beginning .
BuzzFeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the photos of the star.
Only we have a quote from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter J.
They slipped, that was the best description of what happened, gradually they separated like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from her that she was too serious, too troublesome, too intense, too detached, and perhaps even a little prickly.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yeah, he was spiky, like a silk.
The last victim of his sting was a relationship that had initially been promising, one that seemed to ease his loneliness and perhaps even bring some meaning to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicate, delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from a northern village that was even harsher and farther from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt, who had inherited a house in a damp but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, spiders were in every bathroom, snails had left their mark on the windows, making the whole place their own, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, both menacing and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by Howard Jacobson, whose novel J was shortlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
The nominations will be published next week .
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailyn on the broken terrace chairs in the middle of the long grass, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and reassuring news, when Ailyn's crossed, sun-browned feet brought Kevern to the song sung long ago by a forgotten black performer, and which her father had often listened to in the cottage bells below.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were generally too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They weren't banned  nothing was actually banned  they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to forget them, like the word itself.
Public opinion did what laws and proclamations had not done: just as in literature people chose to read memoirs, cookbooks, and romances, in music they preferred ballads.
In the heat of the day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and serenade Ailin's big feet in a cheeky comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller", Kevern told him, naturally raising two fingers to his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter "j" escaped his lips.
It started as a game between her and her father when she was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out a word that starts with a "J" and didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it's not a very fun game now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one if word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to cleverness.
The unpredictability of it made people nervous.
And jazz was the art of being clever through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the time he was 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or coercion were needed.
A obedient society meant that each of its members gratefully accepted the principle that each group did things that were natural to it.
Because of their temperament and physical characteristics, Afro-Caribbean people were best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, they seemed to have a natural talent for electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working telephone to use for business.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED did, those from the Gulf and Middle East whose grandparents had not fled in fear of being accused of brewing the flames and fearing that they would be the next to catch them opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning the water pipe and continued their lives with their eyes downcast and depressed with boredom.
Each one should use his gift according to his own ability.
Ailinn had heard only ballads, and she had difficulty understanding how the offensive words Keverny was singing could ever be put to music.
Music was a way of expressing love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe from the Bigfoot's point of view.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
Not a word would pass through the soundproofing of the giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He was gonna say the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips in front of Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was funny to my dad", she said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair obscured Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing to see in the whole world but the huge, black hair of Ailinn.
That's all she wanted to see.
"If you say so", he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed really confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't exactly big.
His ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your fat ankles", he tried to correct the situation.
I'm a pervert in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he tried to amuse, the effect was quite different, for he, like his father, lacked the persuasive charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite her tender eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her terrace chair, while also pouring the wine they had just drunk.
And the wine was only made from the back of the flower, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the crash.
In his nervousness, he looked shaking like palm leaves in a storm.
"And it's your fat head that's what's so twistedly attractive to me about you", she said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that was in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to turn against him.
Did Ailinn think he was gonna hit?
He had never told Kevern about life on the good North Island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had been basically the same as life here.
The same huge, swollen sea that was waving at them.
The same deranged men, though after the fact even paler and more fiendish than their smuggling and smuggling parents, prowled pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
The fat head?
He'd still see a big fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first  kissing had become the most common word for an erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver  suck first and then attack.
Keverney thought it was too much, too, because sucking was already hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language told her to leave.
He pulled himself up off the balcony chair like an old man.
Ailinn felt exhausted too, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him as he left  just as his companion watched Kevern go from the window above  the man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Keverny and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A backslidden, sullen, ashamed, beaten man who had lost all will to fight  why did he feel that this vision was so familiar to him, even though he could not remember ever having seen anything like it before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the incident just described, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Ofnow, a private opinion-measuring organization, conducted a brief study on the persistence of low- and moderate-level violence in the areas of the country where, given the money and energy spent on ending it, a decrease or even an end to it was most likely.
Much has been done and much remains to be done, he wrote, to compensate for the inherent aggressiveness of a people who have fought for thousands of years and have often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite church towers that reach over hedges, human kindness has rarely been known in the course of time.
But there are some things you can't completely remove.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it engenders.
While the people weep over sentimental ballads, revel in tales of triumphs, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family, the old-fashioned cruelty continues to grip rural and urban neighborhoods, and there is evidence of a new, more vicious streak of strife in our homes, workplaces, streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have a lamentable tendency to dramatize", his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her eyes to the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
'I don't think I need to answer that,' said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
You're a feminist?
It's quiet again.
"I don't ask", said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
This is not a place of prejudice.
We are the servants of a society without prejudice.
While a certain degree of hypersensitivity is in itself perfectly acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, like the one you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
To look at what happened, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental life force of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light announced a directive that Ofnow had been distributing to the country for a quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, disagree, apologize.
Words are better than silence, and songs are better than writing, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you mean", replied Esme Nussbaum in a low voice, sure that her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively cured as we think we are.
I'm worried that if we're not warned, we'll find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to what happened.
But this time, we won't vent our anger and distrust on anyone.
Luther Rabinowitz used his fingers to form a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far", he said, "in describing as "mistakes" the things our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far in saying that they poured their "hate and distrust" on others.
A person in your position should not need to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about us or them.
There was no "us" and no "us".
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
If we are completely honest, in the midst of this chaos,  no group in society can say that it has behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
There was a time.
There's no need to talk about it anymore. We're all in agreement.
And just as it is unnecessary to make accusations, so it is unnecessary to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, even if there is a way to do them.
But what good is the past if we don't learn from it?
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go over your report", he said, indicating that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he was going to work as usual, he was hit by a pedestrian on a motorcycle, described by passersby as "mad and angry".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army denies planning attack; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied staging the coup and said they were acting against police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after receiving death threats.
The army's spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack, saying the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics".
The Lesotho Defence Force took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces were trying to arm young party fanatics who were ready to cause trouble, he told Voice of America.
Clayson Monyela, the South African government's spokesman, said the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
While no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces show the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt on all sides, he says.
According to Lesotho military officials, soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday and the capital is calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing heads the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
The Commission has been working on a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
He denies that he has thus flouted the authority of the government, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to set up data centre in the New World
The computer technology company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in the Netherlands, but the location of this location is not specified.
In a press release from Microsoft, the company states that it does not disclose the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the grid.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
The public had previously suggested Oulu or Kajaani as the site of the centre.
Microsoft will close its Oulu office completely, which will result in the loss of around 500 jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft's communications director, tells STT that the company does not comment on the number of staff employed in the new data center.
The opening of a data centre in the Uudelle Land was reported on Monday by Kauppalehti.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have a number of different equipment options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I took these photos myself at a family party using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts are sealed to prevent water from entering.
In addition, set the camera's image settings to match the images or video you want to take.
Some cameras, or combinations of cameras and camcorders, have a setting that allows for optimal underwater shooting conditions.
 Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can go.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of five feet, others as deep as 50 to 60 feet.
Check out both the standard and waterproof models in our shopping guide and digital camera reviews.
Take a bunch of pictures. Many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display to help you to summarize the image, whereas action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and image alignment can either work or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forking, which means taking multiple shots at the same time at different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light diminishes significantly at a deeper depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake, or ocean.
This also gives you more color in your images; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more so underwater, where light is scarce.
This is especially important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle, meaning that the photographer must be close to the subject to fill the entire frame.
China won't let Hong Kong elect its leaders  Protesters vow revenge
China's parliament on Sunday decided that Hong Kong voters should not vote for candidates in the 2017 election despite growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists began planning and implementing demonstrations just hours after the decision was announced.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to eliminate any candidate who does not obey Beijing.
This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating, says Democratic Party leader, lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It's clear we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese administration, saying that a general candidacy in the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the region that they would be able to choose their own leaders from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also made clear that China wants to tightly control the election process through a nominating committee that is run from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer before the decision, some of the biggest and most high-profile protests in the region in years were held in Hong Kong.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business district unless Beijing grants Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was announced, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong's main administration building in the rain.
In the rally, the organizers announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and would cause waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently for fear of getting into trouble with the authorities.
In a statement posted online, the organizers said the movement considers the Occupy Central ploy a last resort, to be used only when there is no hope of dialogue and no other way.
We regret to inform you that today the last chance for dialogue has been lost and the city will be taken.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security was tight near the main government building, with police and barricades in place.
In Hong Kong, many are fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has created competition for products and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong's values of democracy and freedom of expression are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's living conditions  business.
The protest they are talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts, says lawmaker Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
This kind of image would be bad for investing.
Chinese state media have also reported stories that Hong Kong democracy activists are the henchmen of the Western powers behind the revolution.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 people  more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
US prom tradition hits British universities: new students fly private jets
We are excited to meet demand by establishing Britain's first luxury class travel for today's students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure that the customer arrives at the university in the most memorable way possible.
Stewart said there's a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the country in trucks loaded to the ends of the earth.
When combined with the many features of VIF (VIP-Friends), we are ready to provide today's students with the easiest and highest quality transport to university.
The company representative said that reservations had not yet been received because the service had just been established, but added that students would start ordering in the coming weeks.
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students have very different expectations and aspirations than when they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, so it is more important than ever to make a memorable first impression and the VIF is the right way to do that.
However, the National Union of Students criticizes the service as unrealistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Higher Education Division of the organisation, 'This service plan seems to be very far from the lives of the majority of students'.
Many students start their studies this month shocked by the high cost of living, when the financial aid available in the form of loans and grants has lagged behind the skyrocketing cost of basic education.
Ipswich Fish House for sale
A real estate agent removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk after noticing a large pig lying in the living room.
A one-bedroom house, priced at £120,000, is situated on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad said there was a picture of a pig in the living room with its head on the couch.
According to the realtor, Connells, the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
However, the picture ended up on the notice by mistake and has since been removed, says a company representative.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meetinghouse as a 'unique one-bedroom house'.
Even though the real estate company has removed the image from their website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has generated interest on social media, where people have asked if a pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres's departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish striker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but a replacement came in almost at the same time as the door opened.
Chelsea announced that they have signed French striker Loic Remy from neighbouring QPR on a four-year deal.
The price of the transaction is 13 million euros, according to press reports.
Torres, 30, joins AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record £50million four years ago, but never lived up to expectations.
The decision was also made after the unsuccessful move of Japanese player Shinji Kagawa to Manchester United.
Kagawa is expected to return to Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before moving to ManU.
According to press reports, the transaction price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's new contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the League of Legends.
Now I'm content to be a Dortmund man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment, Kagawa said.
The second Bundesliga team, the Hertha of Berlin, is back with the Solomon's Fish.
The Ivorian striker will move to Hertha from Lille in France for an estimated transfer fee of around EUR 3 million.
Before Lille Kalou, 29, he played for Chelsea from 2006-12.
Eight dead in Paris .
The death toll rose to eight on Monday after an explosion in a high-rise building in the Paris suburbs.
In the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois, 11 people were injured in the accident on Sunday, four of them seriously.
Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in the rubble of the house on Monday, but hopes of finding survivors waned.
The primary cause of the explosion is a suspected gas leak.
The explosion, which occurred early Sunday, was so powerful that it damaged buildings within a hundred yards [100 m] of each other.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so loud that our ears rang", described Maryline Yyvon, who lives near the crash site.
As early as Sunday, emergency shelter was set up for the residents of the house near the school.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Justice Ministry in the capital, Sofia.
In a peaceful protest, they declared that they wanted the old working regulations, which had recently been changed, back.
The Ministers will also discuss salary increases with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against the new hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour work system.
Despite a meeting between prison workers' organizations and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate for the Enforcement of Judgments, told the BNR.
The prison workers' union is also expected to join the protest from the Interior Ministry's trade union.
Basketball: " Fans cheering almost too much "
Basketball Sasu Salin was the epitome of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his bitter U.S. fight and beat Ukraine in the second half with his bloody stand-up decisions.
But Salin took all the credit for that to the wolf fans and he did it in a style:
I almost passed out on the field at the end, that encouragement was so great.
I was blind, I couldn't do anything.
I was almost overwhelmed by the noise and the white crowd.
The hall's moments of power included nine surfaces in fast-paced, ball-shaped, plates and carving everywhere it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow state, and it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to a place of incredible importance, Sasu said.
That's my role.
Doing all that.
It was great to see that the others got the idea.
It's infected the whole gang.
Salin is a cheerleader and a spirit maker, so it's no wonder his example lifted the entire team to a level that was too high for the big, tough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year hiatus: The previous one was a brutal refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in a World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the secondary coach of Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as the overall player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament from yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the opening round.
"The refereeing was brutal on the deciding balls of that match", recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams were already in the rear.
Suddenly, the game was back on.
We lost 2-3, and after that the bastards went even more crazy", Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montosen and eventually placed 17th.
Finland is once again among the world's top teams as the Polish World Cup kicks off on Saturday.
A lot has changed dramatically in 32 years of international volleyball.
The strengths of the players are about the same as before, but the quality and skill are now higher.
The average height of the players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever", Parkkali thought.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish players' base has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to go from the starting block to the next.
It can get tough", Kosonen said.
♪ I'm the one who's been waiting ♪
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on the attack in the victorious match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a World Cup player.
Hopefully, we'll be able to get a 17th place finish.
South Korea and Tunisia should be broken up", Parkkali said.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the assistant coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were the fans in the match against Tunisia.
Sauna and evening worship at the Sailor's Church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's program for the 1982 World Cup.

The finalists will still be recording the songs from the competition.
Immonen says the competition is always a great memory.
Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: 'These men deserve all the credit'
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog were in need in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini courageously offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched Facebook for "international heroes" to thank his supporters once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog he was with in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it forward a little, but its legs just couldn't bear it", Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said no help came from the police, the nearby hotel or passersby.
By the time it got dark, the situation was already starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers were on the scene, Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo, who were willing to help.
The men had visited Norway's highest mountain, Galdhøpiggen, and were heading for their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog, Antti Soini tells in a message to the Evening Words.
Soon a German man happened to be there, carrying a trampoline.
The mattress was found to be the same as the bars to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man arrived moments after us, after we had been thinking about what to do with the dog, and we carried the dog for a moment down the slope, Soini says.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the programme.
The dog was carried down with a trampoline.
Soin said that the performance was not physically difficult, but the difficult terrain was slow to carry.
However, after about an hour and a half, the Cita was successfully brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched Facebook for "international heroes" to thank them once again.
The ringing was answered on Sunday, but the German is still missing.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, and Mikelsen is delighted.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have made it back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I haven't thanked them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, and I am eternally grateful to them.
By Monday night, the Soins were on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: "Cita is said to be getting better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
A British woman spent years in fear of death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought for most of her youth that she had only a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
According to the charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT, which causes motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and pain in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain and is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich ataxia, which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and would die before he reached the age of 30.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two, she says that as a child, she knew that she could not do the things that others could.
I fell every day, and I took longer to do anything than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When he was 13, Rodgers underwent several Achilles tendon operations to straighten his legs, and after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said that he had AF.
I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association, she says.
When I heard from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18 and would die before I was 25, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my functioning.
I went through this myself and I planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the time he was 17, he realized that his gait had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair".
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Some genetic tests showed that she had CMT.
When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was putting it off, she says.
Charity CMT UK is running CMT Month to raise awareness of the disease.
A hundred migrants found in a coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal migrants on a coal train, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The settlers were found late Sunday in Veles, central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from or where they were going", said Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Macedonia, a country of a few million, is a transit country for many illegal immigrants on their way to Western Europe.
The bloody civil war in Syria has already displaced three million people.
Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
The Popyhiads Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined forces with the Scottish independence movement.
According to the Guardian, the bands will be headlining a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
The Scottish independence referendum will be held on 18 September.
In a statement, Mogwai said the vote was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Scots.
In the past, Sean Connery has been a vocal supporter of independence.
Instead, British stars such as Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scottish people to remain part of Britain.
In the gallows, the pro-independence movement has been losing.
The malls' difficulties continued into the middle of the summer.
The decline in the number of shops in the European Union continued in July, reports Dagens Daghandel ry.
According to the Commission, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets was 3,2% lower in July than a year earlier.
The biggest hit has been home and leisure products, which fell by more than 7% from a year ago.
Clothing sales were also significantly weaker than last summer.
On the other hand, the value of retail sales of daily goods increased by almost 3% in July compared with a year ago.
Sales increased most in small shops and large supermarkets.
During the first half of the year, from January to July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets fell by more than 2%.
In contrast, sales of everyday goods have increased by almost 1%.
Joan Rivers ' family wishes her well .
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being brought to a hospital in downtown New York, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from his illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers wrote today.
We hope for the best.
His mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday for cardiac arrest, and sources at the time said the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on the Upper East Side had called the hospital in for an emergency.
Doctors will intentionally keep him sedated with medication and monitor his condition closely until his now serious condition is stabilized.
The case has caused a wide public reaction, with Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa offering support online.
Areva-Siemens: The third reactor in the strait will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided TVO with an updated timetable for Olkiluoto 3.
According to the Areva press release, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the application for approval of the reactor's automation systems.
The project is already years behind schedule.
In May, TVO did not provide any estimate of the completion date of reactor 3.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach land to Bottas, worth about 60000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated to the formula driver Valtteri Bottas 1.4 hectares of beach on the shore of Kärkjärven in Villähte.
The municipal government showed fairness in the sport and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no noise at the meeting when the plot was decided, says the mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
Botts' gift shop has the farm buildings, seven in all.
The city's gonna tear them down this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure apartment on the property within two years.
We're thrilled that she enjoyed her birthday and wants to be here again.
Every year, Walter has been to the elementary school to tell them about his sports career and his life.
And hopefully, it will continue, says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the monetary value of the beach plot at EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the city for over a decade.
Over the decades, Nastola has had varying success in keeping talented athletes in the city.
World champion in the javelin throw Aki Parviainen and world champion in aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo received private housing lots from the municipality and built fancy private houses.
Instead of staying in Nastrola, however, they sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola in search of work and then moved when the living situation changed elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastasya and his situation is different, Syyrakki believes that Bottas will remain in his home town.
The crazy guy washed out the front-runner Hernandez for a club record fee.
The Hull Selection have invested a club record sum in the purchase of Uruguayan international Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will trade for Hull's Italian Palermo partner for £9.5 million, which is around €12 million.
It's a three-year deal.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season as Palermo won Serie B and won promotion to the Italian top flight.
He has scored seven goals in 14 games for Uruguay.
Last summer, in the World Cup final, Hernandez came on as a substitute in two games.
"Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we've come in a short time", said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull announced that they had also acquired Senegal captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian space program failed , geckos sent on sex tour died
Five small geckos sent into space by Russia to breed have died, reports the Russian Federation's space agency Roscosmos.
The Geckos traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning, Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and behaviour of geckos in the weightless state.
The experiment involved one male gecko and four females.
As strange as this experiment sounds, it was intended to be serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs.
The effects on geeks can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on humans when they are in a similar state for longer periods of time, illustrated the New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos says they're working on the time of death and cause or causes of death.
According to Interfax News, the passengers who were crossed into "sex cakes" froze.
Another surprising fact is that the fruit flies that were traveling on the same Foton-M4 fleet survived the journey without difficulty and also produced offspring.
France has arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice airport .
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities announced the incident on Sunday.
Authorities caught the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the border into Syria.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul and alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
Authorities say the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence had been following his activities before.
In France, the authorities have expressed concern that radicalised young people drawn to the wars in Iraq and Syria are also a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or persons registered in France have traveled to Syria during the recent conflict, returned from there or are planning to go there.
We have a good chance of winning .
The basketball team's hopes for a place in the final are at stake as Finland takes on Ukraine in their second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains in the future.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, predicted Peter Koponen.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their opening game of the tournament on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose leadership Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100m world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter's a fast guy, but yes, we've played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in shape, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's loss to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee you that the field will see a normal wolf pack, said the Mouse.
The alleged nude photos of Hollywood stars are being circulated online , some of which have been confirmed to be authentic .
The Internet is filled with a series of nude images purporting to be of well-known public figures.
Among others, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the target of a "nude campaign".
Entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, officials threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos of her being released are authentic.
She had taken these pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the terrible trouble that went into making this.
"I feel sorry for all those who have been hacked", he writes, according to the website.
But actress Victoria Justice says the photos that are being circulated under her name are fake.
The Commission has also received complaints from the Member States concerning the use of the internet in the production of pornographic images.
Honka's goalkeeper criticizes his own team: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here".
FC Honka is currently in last place in the Bet Liga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after the VPS game on Sunday, well describe the confused current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything", Viitala said after the 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not happy with the poor defensive play.
The player traffic in Hong Kong has been very busy this summer, and that's why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed slowly.
The multiplayer roulette game has also given many young gamblers opportunities they may not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here", the villain murmured, without naming any individual players.
Hong's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team", Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that seat and take the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot expect immediate success when their playmates are constantly changing.
This season, there has never been two consecutive meetings of the same lineup.
Especially on defense, the lineup has changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position", said Kuqi.
Honka is the series champion after losing to VPS, tied for second to last with TPS.
With seven rounds left in the league, the Espoles still have time to avoid relegation to Division One.
I've never let the team down, and I'm not gonna let it down now.
We're definitely not going to drop this series", the goalie Scarecrow said.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after a decade-long hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier is planning to return to the TV series.
A Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series project was presented by Louise Vesth, former producer of Trier films, on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
According to a press release from production company Zentrop, filming for the series is expected to begin in 2016.
Trier is reportedly set to begin writing the show this fall.
The show is in English.
The mystery project is also being reported by Trier's longtime partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his tough sales pitches.
He says that a series like this "has never been seen before and will never be seen again".
"Hold your breath", Aalbæk Jensen said in a press release.
Lars von Trier, 58, has become known in recent years for his sensational media appearances and for such films as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
For television, he directed the 1990s series The Kingdom.
The retail chain Lidl seems to have won over the Finnish public, at least if the figures are to be believed.
The turnover of the Lidl Suomi Kommandiittiyhtiö group, which operates the Lidl Finland business group, continued to grow in the financial year ending at the end of February.
The company also increased its revenue.
Profit before tax reached EUR 79.6 million, compared with EUR 56.4 million a year earlier.
The turnover increased from EUR 960 million to EUR 1,2 billion.
The growth was 25 percent.
The company, which increased its market shares, also improved its operating profit from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The operating profit margin was 7.1.
The German-owned Lidl's financial year runs from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company reported that it paid EUR 13,7 million in tax to Finland for the financial year ended in February.
The company, which has been continuously expanding its chain of stores, has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
The company currently has 142 Lidl stores in Finland and employs over 4 000 people.
The first stores opened in 2002.
The Ice Bucket Challenge contestant with his chin out of place.
British Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly as she was poured with ice-cold water that she injured the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been admitted to hospital after she screamed while performing an Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone went out of place.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly as she was poured with ice-cold water that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just screamed, but as I screamed I felt my jaw start to stiffen", she tells The Mirror.
They're pouring ice water on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mom and my sisters saw the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to rush to the ER.
A 20-year-old Briton who took part in a highly-favored challenge on Tuesday was taken to hospital where his jaw was reattached.
The video has become an Internet sensation, shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
A view of the wolf howling: How can the increase in fan numbers be explained?
I had a great day today.
That was the statement of basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland played France in the European Championship final at the Marous Ballroom in Athens.
I don't think Pehkonen was exaggerating.
I remember the game when you were here.
So were the about a hundred Finns who shouted into the otherwise empty hall of 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times the number of Finnish soldiers.
The 1995 European Championship was a trying time for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifier at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory would open the door to European cream.
Everything seemed fine.
There were promising youngsters, like Hanno Mottola.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann has lifted Möttöla into the final tournament squad.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now, you can say that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything didn't go according to plan.
After Athens, the basketball team went deep.
At the Athens Games, a total of just over a hundred Finns were reportedly present.
Among them were journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches, and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives, coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have fluctuated between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever number is in between, it's a completely incomprehensible number.
I'll explain this to the sports sociologists.
In a global economy, businesses move across borders.
In sports, we still have a chance to see how we're doing internationally.
With increased mobility, we can visit to see how our daughters and sons are doing in the world", says Hannu Itkonen, professor of exercise sociology.
I'm sure there are Finns in Poland looking for a living, both in Spain and at the Volleyball World Cup.
Shared experience.
Still doesn't explain everything.
Sports itself must have an appeal.
Crying is elevating sports to the top of popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to a sports event than to Berlin to see art.
If you don't succeed, you can't get the masses moving.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and the players to take up the sport professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the tide turned and the national team was brought to the stage.
The volleyball people did the same move a little earlier.
Now they're both enjoying the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have succeeded in producing their top sport, where the holy trinity operates: sports media sponsors.
It's a good way to get the audience interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can the sports of football carry this massive interest into the domestic series?
Basketball and volleyball are played to an average of hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
The weeping willow considers the question a good one and may not give an answer that promises much good for the species.
The other school board thinks the interest is shifting.
The other is the one who doesn't want a full stomach.
These guys are ready for the World Cup, but their basic thinking is that home games are not a big deal.
It's a challenge for people who are on drugs.
The security of the Botas property - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola is rewarding formula driver Walter Botts with a beach house.
The city council unanimously approved the transfer of the 1.4 hectare plot at its meeting on Monday.
The plot will be built in the future as a holiday home.
Nastola has been following Botts' success since his days in karting.
He's considered a good ambassador to market the Bay, the Bay area and the Nastola.
The gift estate is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It's been taken over by the city of Nastola as part of a larger real estate deal.
The area has seven buildings in a state of disrepair, six of which will be demolished by the end of this year at the expense of the municipality.
Bottas has won his fourth Formula One World Championship title this year.
He's fifth in the points standings.
Bottas is a native of Nostola and lived in Villähtey during his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he visits Nastola whenever he's off the formula.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth centers.
Design-intelligent clothing is coming, but it's hardly for the poor.
It's showing and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis tournament currently underway in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by football fans on the field, but so is amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top college players.
He says the shirt helps him monitor his own progress and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt has woven silver sensors that transmit information to the shirt's butt and from there to a smartphone or tablet.
The sensors measure your heart rate, your breathing, your stress, your steps.
The centrepiece is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not said when the shirt will go on sale, nor has it even hinted at its price, reports Tech Times.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company investing in smart clothes.
Athos, California, has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, muscle activity.
The clothes cost $100 each, and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs $200.
Techno-wear was also covered by Red Orbit.
A clever way to save on textbooks
The cost of college tuition in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon after starting his second year, Matt Schroeder came up with a clever way to save money.
He developed a system whereby students in later years borrowed their books for nominal fees instead of selling them on the spot.
"My math book would normally have cost $180, but I paid $10 for the entire semester and a sandwich", says 19-year-old Schroeder, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly turning to online shopping and creative approaches like Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book for the entire semester at a significantly lower cost than students who buy the book.
Neebo Inc., a company that operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rental books last spring, says Trevor Meyer, chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save some real money.
Other retail trade
In online stores, a new book can be purchased for only one third of what it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler has a suggested retail price of nearly $290, but the book will be available at Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other people's notes or worn out appearance.
For example, the Calculus book is available for $93.49 on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he bought the book Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business on Amazon.com for only $0.42.
If it was new, it would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use earlier editions in a course.
Sometimes the updates to the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can be found for only a fraction of the price of the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular second-hand bookstore.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them, and do not need them after the course.
Renting a book can save you over 80 percent on the price of a new one.
For example, renting a book called Calculus for a full semester costs about $20.
Check the rental company's policies, such as notes, use of the highlighter, and charges for wear and tear.
If you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price.
Other, including paper and paperboard
The purchase of e-books instead of paper books may also be an option.
Sometimes these books are rented, whereby the owner is paid for the use of the e-book, for example, to Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
Chegg's is offering a six-month e-book of Calculus for about $61.
Bracey says that many literature students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, whereas science and technology books can be very expensive.
It's worth comparing different vendors, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start law school at Pepperdine, recommends using the ISBN number of a book to determine the price, as it will help you to be sure you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, Gault says, make sure the book is in stock.
He learned this from his own footsteps.
The book she bought was on hold for four weeks, and she eventually had to get the book at full price from the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theatre is 20 years old
The theatre, founded in 1994, fights against unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
The event is open to anyone who wants to make performing arts.
Organises expressive activities for the longterm unemployed aged 17-35.
The shows often take a stand on society.
In recent years, it has featured such depressing programs as Moderate Depression, Me As I Am!, humorous narratives about narcissism, and classic adaptations.
He believes that every person can change their own life.
Nearly double the number of people killed in fires last year
This year, fires have killed almost twice as many people as last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Central Rescue Organization (Spek), 55 people have died in 49 fires so far.
Last year, at this time, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the worst year was 2009, when 64 people died in fires by the end of August.
Most fire deaths occur in apartment buildings.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached homes, and seven in row houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me to double down on fire safety at home.
At least, Spek says, all home fire alarms should be functional.
In addition, all should check that the starter equipment is readily available.
There must also be an unobstructed exit from all areas of the home.
Children should also be told what electronic devices they can use when they are alone in the home.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was called the counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough was following events over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had come from as far away as Belgium.
The youngsters were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were rescued after being stranded overnight in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a walk on Sunday afternoon at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned about the youths who had not returned home, the family called the police at eight o'clock that night.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent out to search for the youths, and the pair were found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 11 p.m.
She hurt her knee, and he fell and hit his head.
The cops spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, where they are in stable condition.
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport .
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the Luhansk airport.
The Ukrainian army says the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to the Ukrainian side, the paratroopers have been engaging fiercely with the Russian tanks in the field.
The army spokesman said the enemy's artillery fire was so accurate that the shooter was probably a Russian professional soldier.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol boat that was hit by artillery yesterday in the Sea of Azov off the coast of southeastern Ukraine sank this morning, according to the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
Border Patrol wasn't sure what the target was.
Separatists posted on social media yesterday that they shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Russia will not attack Ukraine.
The European Union has also been involved in the fight against terrorism.
The Foreign Minister said that the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and Ooty should be based on an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
The European Union is also committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
"At the same time, we will draw conclusions about the actions of our partners", Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets in Malmö and Copenhagen were flooded on Sunday as heavy rains battered southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut several roads, disrupted traffic, and buried cars in the mud.
Officials estimated on Sunday that it may take some time for the flood to subside, even though rain was forecast to stop by Monday.
Heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise and no advance warning was issued.
Ari Mustala, a weather forecaster on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the severe weather that affected the area was very local.
The rainforest looks narrow and fixed.
No wonder it's been so hard to predict.
French socialists should "keep quiet and help France", says François Hollande's main supporter
Valls called on the deeply divided left to 'show their feelings' for the struggling Socialist president, whose new government failed to win the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
Our task is to stand by him, Valls said, and earned a standing ovation.
In a reassuring gesture, the prime minister urged the government to leave the controversial 35-hour workweek in France alone, despite a controversial proposal by new finance minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to work with the government in a joint session.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused a rift by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs who expressed differing views and criticizing the Socialist Party for 'allowing France to lose hope for the future'.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, which calls for the EU to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
Francois Hollande may have gone off to war, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not last even a summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter", Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve parliament and was sure of his party's electoral victory in the early elections and that he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the majority in the May EU elections.
A poll by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party may split into several rival factions before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Polytechnic University of Paris, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless a new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and raising unemployment to record levels.
There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realise that change is happening, he warned.
Otherwise, it could get worse.
The Pokka betrayed Tomorrow's Finnish presenters Kirsi Alm-Siiran, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda pokka betrayed badly in the recorded part of the program.
Tomorrow's Finland broadcast posted a funny video on its Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the broadcast of the following day's commercials for Tomorrow in Finland, but the recording doesn't go all the way through.
Alm-Siira gets confused when he tries to say the word budget race, and his confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their boots time after time.
And these heroes should be allowed to be broadcast live even tomorrow, says the Facebook update of Tomorrow Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook, with over 10,000 likes and shares.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, a photographer for the magazine, was third in the series of portraits in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in May 1971 at the Building Masters' House in Fredrikinkadu, Helsinki.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
However, at the beginning of the meeting, we had plenty of time to film for five minutes.
I took this picture from 15 feet away.
The light and the background were in place.
I knew right away that this time I had it.
Meir's expression shows that the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
Back then, you could do a competition with pictures of famous people or events.
It's great that nowadays you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have the idea and the visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is a picture of Lasse Virén falling from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the contest.
The claim: The Aarnio investigation, which has already cost more than EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 years of human work.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki said in her thesis on information technology at Jyväskylä University.
The report also stresses that the Commission's proposal to set up a European Data Protection Supervisor is not a good one.
The border is a place where modern technology allows for the multi-use of forensic evidence.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the information collected for the purpose of solving a crime is automatically electronic evidence that completes the chain of evidence, while allowing for comprehensive legality monitoring.
We'll have a review of the claim on Saturday.
General: The concept of vegetarianism in 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and poultry foods on a vegetarian diet"
The image of a special bulletin on the wall of the Women's Travel School in Pirkkala caused a panic on social media, Yle reports on its website.
- They're vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet includes fish and chicken for school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the menu, we make a vegetarian alternative!
That's what it says on a 15-year-old, forgotten bulletin on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread on social media has led people to send an angry response to the municipality of Pirkkalan.
The head of the food and cleaning service, Arja Vaarma, tells Ylee that the note left on the wall is not correct and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there was a time when this idea was discussed with health care.
Every student gets a meal of their choice, she tells Ylee.
Today, in the schools of Pirkkalan, students are offered a vegetarian alternative only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or healthcare provider.
The danger to Ylee is that young people's experimentation with vegetarianism may leave them undernourished and the lack of meat or chicken may surprise the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise line, is in talks to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, according to people closely involved.
The transaction will give Norwegian Cruise, which has a market capitalisation of USD 6,8 billion, access to the luxury and high net worth customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete with the larger companies Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources say the potential agreement could be announced as early as this week, although it is also possible that negotiations may not yield results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and the representative of Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Company has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
The Commission also noted that the Chinese exporting producer did not provide any information on the export performance of the Union industry.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and its itinerary covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1,2 billion, an increase of 6% on the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle classes in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are competing to become the first choice for these new customers when they choose cruising.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Spanish authorities on the measures in question.
Apollo has owned the majority of the company's stock since the 2007 sale, valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current form in 2000 following the merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting held 28% of the company, Apollo 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8% from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of the North American cruise capacity, according to the registration document published at the time of the Prestige Cruise share issue.
The Tampere city council will consider the matter today.
The animal hopes the city government will give it a solid support.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the director of Animalia, who is preparing her doctoral thesis at Tampere University, the age of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become widespread around the world that keeping sophisticated mammals like dolphins in dolphinariums is not animal welfare or ethical.
I hope that this view will also be applied to Tampere.
The closure of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, says Tuomivaara.
The death of the blue dolphin reinforces the requirements for dolphinariums.
The death of this species is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium of the Spastic River.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a sealed area, a kind of dolphin sanctuary, demands Doodle.
This was not enough time to experience a return to the dolphin's original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins in Särkännim will have time to experience more life than their idle concrete pool, Doomivaara hopes.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to ban the use of all wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Protection Act.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the demand, the executive director of AnimalAlia, Tuomivaara, will participate in a demonstration for the dolphins on September 1st.
The Commission is proposing to extend the deadline for the submission of applications for the approval of the new rules.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are captured or cruelly killed each year, either for dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government end fighting against separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations for the region's "secession", Russian news sources report.
Mr Peskov said that the Russian president had not intended the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine to become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their rights and interests.
Mr Putin's demand that the Kiev government negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to effectively grant independence to the newly declared Novorossiya, which will allow it to turn to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state TV channel Kanava 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to retake the separatist-held eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which the separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the region "Novorossiya", "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the glory days before the Russian revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are "an illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attack civilians in separatist-held areas.
We must immediately start broad negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-east Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there, he says.
Peskov said Putin's reference to "statehood" was related to a broader independence issue that has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership as it tries to allay fears among Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the autonomy they need, Peskov says.
The EU's foreign policy is not a matter for discussion, he said, because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but an internal conflict.
The Kremlin spokesman's interim comment, intended to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian authorities are handling the separatist uprising in the eastern regions differently from the Crimea, which was effectively occupied by a region with a population of 2 million people, the majority of whom are ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because pre-conflict opinion polls showed that the majority of the population favored remaining in Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats have been discussing in international forums, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin in effect control over the territory that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, commercial shipping ports and historic coastal sites.
The region between Rostov and Crimea, Russia, also contains mines, factories and metal insulation plants that produce vital products for the Russian military.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers  after new elections  consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the core of Ukraine over their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to be radically different from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, who may be armed and incited by Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev government for negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the capture of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsk will be the beginning of a larger effort to seize the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military reinforcements in Mariupol, a city of half a million people known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and the narrow strip of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Mr Poroshenko addressed European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for further action to prevent further Russian insults in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and tanks on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; leaders proposed the development of additional sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 troops moved to the Donetsk region last week to reinforce the struggling separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers that Russia has surrounded in Ilovaisk were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
The opening goal of Milan was scored by Japanese driver Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari hit first and a little later Jeremy Menez hit a penalty kick.
Lazio also got a penalty in the last minute after his goal, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez deflected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez has joined Milan from Real Madrid for the season.
Inzaghi, former Milan striker, was only halfway through his first season as manager of San Siro.
The crowd was reported to be 39,000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the midst of a nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his outrage over the possible theft of nude photos by hackers of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecco.
The entertainment world has been in a frenzy since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted online in the wake of a widespread celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of The Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, including top models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Michelle Lee, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecco, who lives in Melbourne, have also apparently been stolen in the iCloud leak.
There are 101 famous people on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting.
All personal contact and photos should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Greckon, who is based in New York, reportedly commented on the case in an online newspaper as "shameful" and said that the victims "feel humiliated".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her former boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two of Palmer at the edge of an empty upper pool.
Palmer's film credits include Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch star Browning did not comment on the hacked photos last night.
Lawrence's rep told TMZ that this is a blatant invasion of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen was furious with the hacker, tweeting: "Publishing stolen phone photos is no different than selling stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be allowed, from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if it were at home and won a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan craze.
Katowice, Poland, was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, almost 2000 Finnish residents watched the Finnish victory at Spodek Arena.
It was like playing on my own field.
That's how much the fans influenced our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost the match 0-2, but came back to win the match 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a surprise jump by six points.
Cuba led 16-10 in the first half, but then the Finns got the better of the game.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when a chartered plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the game.
Finnish football fans have been conquering Europe at a fast pace in recent days.
At the World Cup in Bilbao, Spain, there are over 8,000 Finnish fans.
As if every Finnish basket had been the winning basket of the match, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's game.
