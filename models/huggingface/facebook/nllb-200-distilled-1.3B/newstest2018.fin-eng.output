Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's making art about the theme of "A man should have the right to his own body".
The project room at the Academy of Fine Arts has dozens of patient reports on the ceiling.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and her identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell my personal history of treatment to make the violence of the process visible", says Auer.
By process, he's referring to the process of gender repair.
It is often a period of years of study that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the diagnostic studies for 'gender identity disorder' to be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the trial began four years ago.
Before that, he had used estrogen he ordered online and was already well into his recovery.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to correct their gender legally.
The Translaw, or the law on gender identification for transsexuals (563/2002) obliges transsexuals to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender, for example in the population register and in passports.
Currently, every gender-corrected person is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility.
A man has the right to decide what he wants to do with his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights", says Auer.
The reform of the Transla law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to selfdetermination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
The elections came and the Founders took over the government.
Now the amendment is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes that have nothing to do with this particular law.
"The government is reluctant to bring it up because of disagreements within the government about changing the law", says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty's Finland division.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
The second is the package leaflet and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the translation of Auer by a transpo psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and based these on a report that would define Auer's right to treatment and assistance.
The reality of the subject appears to be susceptible to fluctuation.
The subjects' self-concept is shown to be fragmented at the borderline level and personality instabilities are highlighted.
Auer didn't identify himself from these descriptions.
"I was shocked to learn that I had been diagnosed with a mental illness", says Auer.
Even more shocking was the refusal of Auer to receive sex reassignment therapy.
The medical staff said that he didn't have the resources to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the TV in the Transpol waiting room.
Later, that television produced an artwork called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is born female can get breast augmentation, but breast removal requires a diagnosis", says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything other than the sex you were born with.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the gender reassignment process is more difficult for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own gender experience.
"It is crazy that people who need support and assistance are denied treatment on the grounds that they do not have enough resources", says Auer.
Many of those who apply for the process have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
On this basis, the healthcare professional may decide that treatment cannot be started.
"Depriving people of access to treatment and help can put them in a worse situation than they were before the process began", says Auer.
Auer's solo exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts all my adult life, and it is something that people usually find difficult to process".
The depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started using hormones, she felt better.
He was finally able to express the feelings that had been there since childhood and adolescence.
Why a wide jaw didn't seem to fit your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer has been to have people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much in your speech, your dress, your voice, your movements", she says.
Today, Auer already feels that she is being seen, that she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, casual comments from close relatives could hurt a lot.
The thing that hurts the most is when someone close to you gets in trouble.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't or can't internalize it", he continues.
However, not all transgender people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, in which the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a lengthy research process, it is impossible to formally confirm one's gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies", says Auer.
And it is true.
For example, in Denmark, the Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising legal gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination as regards legal gender.
The adult applicant shall make a written application for a new identity card stating that he/she considers himself/herself to be of the opposite sex.
After the six-month period of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall issue a new personal identification number to the applicant.
This right to self-determination is also demanded of Finland and this demand is also reflected in the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but rather a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has value and that it can be used to bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The civil rights organization issued a travel advisory to Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel advisory for Missouri, citing the state's discriminatory practices and recent racist attacks.
NAACP's Missouri travel advisory, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and locals to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling in the state, which has recently experienced a number of questionable racially motivated incidents, the statement said.
A recent law passed in Missouri makes it difficult to bring discrimination cases to justice, and the state's enforcement of laws disproportionately targets minorities, which the NAACP says led to the travel warning.
The civil rights of people are being violated.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin and beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
We have never heard of so many cases in such a short time.
The Missouri travel advisory is the organization's first warning for a U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tennessee black Tory Sanders as examples.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, while driving across the state when his car ran out of fuel and he was arrested by Missouri State Police, although he was not charged with a crime.
The travel brochure also referred to a study by the Missouri Attorney General's office that showed that police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people to be on the lookout and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what may happen in Missouri, says Chapel.
People should prepare themselves by, for example, bringing money to pay for bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel across the state.
According to the FBI, Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, the 16th most of any state in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, a constitutional civil rights organization, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws requiring police to arrest people for immigration violations, which the organization says increases racial profiling.
Although travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department and are for other countries, recently NGOs have issued them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
General: Lintilä requested a report from Finnair on the CEO's supplementary pension
The Minister for Economic Affairs, Mika Lintilä (center), has asked Finnair to investigate the additional pension payment received by the airline's CEO, Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
The Minister said it was contrary to the will of the government.
The additional pension of 130 000 euros received by Vauramo came to light this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of stock exchange executives.
Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper Finland's national newspaper reported on Vauramo's additional pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would withdraw its supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has made it a policy that no additional pensions are used for rewards.
The State owns more than half of Finnair.
The company claims that the decision is in line with last year's decision in principle on ownership management.
Sanctions immediately intensified the speeches
Not long ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were moving from cold to warm.
Meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit of industrialized nations in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along just fine.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions passed by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with a bitter reaction in Russia.
The most damning response so far has come from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said the Trump-signed sanctions bill would spell "a full-scale trade war".
Even if the Russian reaction were to be dismissed as mere political rhetoric, the fact remains that tensions between the United States and Russia have grown after the short honeymoon of Trump's election.
In the United States, passing the Russian, Iranian and North Korean asylum laws was not easy.
While Congress passed the bill with remarkable unanimity, the president was reportedly far more difficult to pass.
Trump criticized the law he just signed as "significantly flawed".
President Trump's fist may have been particularly responsible for Russia, although the passage of a law restricting his own powers must have been repugnant.
As is well known, the United States is investigating possible Russian interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's Russian ties.
Tensions between the United States and Russia are a reality after a short honeymoon.
With the White House staff changing slowly and scandalous twists and turns being revealed almost daily, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not being conducted under the leadership of the president but in spite of the president.
This situation is by no means desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a liability in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to the economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is straining relations.
The EU has made a prominent reference to the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
Although the Union has so far remained, at least on the surface, united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member state like Finland which trades heavily with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The impact of the recent US immigration law is still unclear.
The EU has expressed concern that the sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power project.
The European Union has been sour because of the exclusion of the US economy's liquefied natural gas (LNG) from sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics, a means of expressing disapproval.
But sanctions must be well thought out and carefully considered.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Nothing is sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The absence of statues is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis collaborated with American troops to bring down the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdous Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's chief ideologues, knew what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta, when the Statue of Liberty came under Miller's attack in a rhetorical rant about the president's proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller wasn't really criticizing the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise ship operators and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
His attack was directed at the significance of the statue and in particular the fact that in 1903 the statue's base was added to the statue with the poem by Emma Lazarus  17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller told Acosta, "I don't want to go into the history of it now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom illuminating the world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller wasn't wrong in himself, but it's not just history, as he said.
The key words are Lazarus's touching words, the only ones of their kind, in which the state invites not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
The poem is more relevant now than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic, he made it clear that the poorest of the poor are not welcome in Trump's America.
The debate over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a larger political and cultural debate over the significance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death to have the poem affixed to his statue, knowing full well that the act was strongly political.
The statue was intended to express the connections between the French and American Republican empires in a classic symbolism, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: the female figure in his poem is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And she gives herself a new name: the mother of the banished.
The poem's incorporation into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationalist message.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh  the trailblazer, now seen as some sort of harbinger of Trump  argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an invitation to anyone, but an early precursor for neoconservatives to carry the American torch into a darkened world: Lady Liberty steps forward.
He's carrying the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch will not lead us to the United States.
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on your perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is a comfort, a hope, a welcome.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not show the way, but ignites the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish national team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time when only two Scots made the Great Britain national team
Neil Black, chief executive of the British Athletics Federation, says the 16 Scottish players on the World Cup team are "a significant boost".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday.
Black said there was something special happening in Scotland that British athletics needed to learn from.
This is welcome and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake, says Black.
I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they felt that it was related to the Institute's work.
The Scottish Athletic Association, on the other hand, believes that it is linked to the activities of the association,
And the British Athletic Association believes that their actions are behind it.
And the average street kid thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something very, very great, whatever the reason.
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres.
Elidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly brilliant, Black says.
The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated, wherever they happened to live and train.
Yesterday's words were one of genuine passion and passion for sport.
Eilidh Doyle, Commonwealth silver medallist in the 400m hurdles, and this is her fifth World Championships, thinks it's "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 to 2015.
Laura Muir, a middle distance runner, has broken five British and two European records this year.
He's competing in the 1500m and 5000m in London.
Chris O'Hare is running the 1,500 metres in London, and he's also worth watching, with a great season, including wins at the British Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup appearances, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "very proud" of the number of Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for finals and medals.
Being captain is a great honour, but it is even more special because the national team members voted for the captain, says Doyle.
I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It just goes to show how far we've come.
They are involved as accomplished athletes, competing for prizes.
The captain's speech?
I think it went pretty well.
I was just focusing on how lucky we are to have a home run.
It's important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and to be back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to race there and I know the atmosphere is going to be incredibly great.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
I'm sure you were annoyed by the criticism.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is taken away, we may be led dumb and silent as sheep to slaughter", Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked the author of them.
The ACLU sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unfounded, and the response was disparaging online as well.
It's just Facebook, and a lot of people commented.
But it matters.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the surprisingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He's got the second-highest rating of any governor in the country.
Hogan's not a very sensitive person.
He has led the state steadfastly and firmly on principle.
He has also used Facebook as a main channel of communication with his constituents, posting a photo of his bald head undergoing chemotherapy.
That's why blocking users from the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with The Washington Post, saying it was all about moderating comments.
But labeling commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed some of the users Hogan blocked on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they had chosen, and they were not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and appropriate.
The pastor quoted from the Bible in his commentary; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news", he wrote in the Washington Post's commentary.
I also cannot accept that when several people comment on the same thing, they are immediately seen as somehow organized and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.
The governor's staff called the comments "a focused attack". Someone else might call them promoting issues they deemed important.
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to control communication by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But it's really the same thing, just now digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
Judge James C. Cacherik of the Alexandria County Circuit Court has ruled that the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment by blocking a voter's access to Facebook.
And the American Civil Liberties Union went to talk to the Republican governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's time, low-cost postal services had the same effect as the Internet today.
Newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers began to mock Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers criticizing Washington's decisions.
The Office of the President was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the US-UK Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington web project.
Yet, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting that fact.
It is advisable to stop feeding the birds in the summer immediately
We've got samples coming in from about a half dozen locations, plus online reports from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern Finland and the Republic of Finland, but then there are also some from Haapavesi and Seinäjo, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evirasta.
The green beans are dead from a parasitic disease called trichomoniasis.
It is caused by a primate called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has been known to attack pigeons in the past, and especially pigeons.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in birds of prey.
2009 was a pretty good year.
At that time, trichomoniasis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green bread crop, after which the crop has been recovering.
There have been cases of sick green alligators, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, curator of the University of Helsinki's Natural History Museum.
The fear is that the previous epidemic of green beans will recur if nothing is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding the birds in the summer immediately.
We'll talk about it later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home field advantage at Renaissance Club .
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is hoping to take advantage of the home advantage for the next three days as Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, a Northern Irishman, led the side at the neighbouring Archerfield Links last year before losing to Paul Eales in the final round.
I watched the Renaissance Club being built, and this event will bring it to its full glory, says Rafferty.
The players see the field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a passionate ambassador for the game, and he's proud of what he's accomplished here.
This tournament is a great introduction to this arena.
Eales, from England, is defending his title for the first time, having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in a 32-year career.
This feels like a really special occasion, says the Southport-based player.
I didn't get to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because it's not on the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
I'm just going to go back to last year, and I think winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time, one we will always remember.
Gary Orr returns to the real world on his home turf, having joined the tour earlier this year for his 50th birthday.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
Gambling at home is always more meaningful than usual, says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I've been enjoying the game again and playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far.
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will feature six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry to the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 if there is only one driver and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds from the sale will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
The bag was used to check for any air problems inside the barracks .
No air problems have been found in the barracks of the Pori Brigade, at least so far, the brigade said Thursday.
We're continuing the air-to-air search.
The investigation began when a man who had been medically discharged from the service felt that his health had deteriorated due to the poor air quality in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holman, the head of the Pori Brigade, there are no medical problems among the other Marines.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that no other members of the unit had any health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to get this matter thoroughly investigated.
At the moment, we are not aware of any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The brigade's press release says that due to the July arrival of the eggs, the goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused a momentary increase in dust.
This may have caused the air to appear stuffy, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold, Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use heat in her cooking.
He rarely uses the kettle.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotala, the capital of the Paniai region in Indonesia's troubled Papua province.
After half an hour, the roasted sweet potatoes are eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Dege's home has no furniture, and he sits on a muddy pavement where he usually does his daily chores, such as washing clothes in the muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom is responsible for delivering the bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned to tend the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink heavily.
"Nobody dares to walk in the village after 5pm", says Degei.
This is a rare glimpse into the everyday highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969, before the country's accession was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villagers were forced to vote publicly in front of occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which tightly controls the area and blocks foreign journalists and human rights monitors from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the eastern part of the island belonging to Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotali is remote and rugged, and the journey starts with a one-and-a-half-hour flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, followed by a tumultuous five-hour drive by rental car.
There's no public transportation here.
The city of some 19,000 is surrounded by bamboo houses, with corrosion-colored clock-brown roofs.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribe of Papua worshipped Uga Tamee, a god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this", says Degei, referring to her colorful, hand-woven headband, dark skirt and brightly coloured sweater.
Before, we had only leaves to cover our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its population living below the poverty line, and the infant mortality and illiteracy rates are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
Paniai is a highland region about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, and just 60 miles [100 km] from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most productive gold mine, owned by the Freeport McMoran Company, based in Phoenix, U.S.A.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
But for the Papuans, these riches bring misery, for they mean the oppressive presence of a powerful Indonesian military.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local Army units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers being paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten this source of income and are being silenced mercilessly.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured, and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings of the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970's reached the scale of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful protests.
The 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, includes accounts of previous year's atrocities, including extrajudicial killings, torture  rape and electrocution are particularly popular methods  and ruthless attacks on peaceful protests.
It is difficult to count the number of victims because cases are occurring weekly, says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83 percent of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as Muslims from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi migrate to the area in the hope of a better life.
Javanese warung restaurants sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed with peanut sauce.
It's hard to compete with the locals.
Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market at a lower price than locals, says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Panias and moved to the provincial capital for work.
Local women lost their client.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , nicknamed Jokowi , promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice, You says.
The Pania experienced a sort of wave bottom just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols around a fire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on a motorcycle.
Frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
Another soldier was not happy with the remark, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses report that drunken soldiers grabbed the children and beat them with rifle butts.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, slipped into a coma as a result of the abuse.
A few hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans  young men and women and children  gathered in front of the local police station and military command center on a football field to demand justice.
They brought their hunting bows for the festivities and began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, which involves dancing in a circle and mimicking the song of birds.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones at police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere heated up, the soldiers received an internal radio system that said: If crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death. The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been released to the local media.
Jeremías Kayame, 56, a mayor of Kego Koto, sensed the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", she told TIME magazine of a brightly painted porch in her wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
Several shots were fired in the rear.
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him", Yohanes told TIME magazine, saddened.
I saw that she was dead... and I kissed her.
Papua's police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us, said Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a moving speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and pledging to address the violence in Papua.
I want this case investigated immediately so that it never happens again.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
But he immediately began to retract his remarks.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes', he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind and said he was not going to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court", he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity" linked to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence referendum.
The families of the victims of the panias are taking the allegations with a gloomy disbelief.
I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but nothing has happened, says Yohanes.
I'm tired of this.
He says he still lives in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid", he says.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot.
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Paniaans are afraid to discuss what happened.
He says that soldiers had beaten him after he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after they bury the victims", he says.
The shooting's not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Deiya neighborhood of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 injured in a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company, which began when the manager refused to take a man who had lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been washed up while fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated on a construction site outside the company office.
Police say villagers have been throwing stones at police officers who have responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified, we are afraid of retaliation", says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiya parliament has called for the police officers responsible for the shootings to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes living in the rugged central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans through occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Panias, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Panias in the name of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of the people we arrest never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The Enarotalo has only a little rice for sale, and it's too expensive for the locals, too.
Like bread.
People grow their own food, mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes are only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the gap between the livelihoods of locals and migrants has widened, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to local, better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Few Papuans have the capital and skills to run their own businesses competitively.
Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money, says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The world has little regard for remote Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite being granted a rare licence for filming, due to their official inability to cooperate with local institutions.
Phelim Kinen, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi has failed to deliver on his election promises, not to increase transparency and not to promote development by removing restrictions on reporting.
Reporters reporting from Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces, face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting, Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only from Papua's near neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States  Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands  called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the numerous and widespread violations in Papua, including the shooting in Panai.
These countries have also traditionally supported the liberation movement in Papua.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.
The locals want the foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, said a source who attended the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Indonesia is holding presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Jokowi means well, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shooting, says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the Panamanians: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army, in scarcity and poverty, with virtually no health care services and no educational opportunities.
Gobai said that the Paniaans, like other Papuans, consider the votes they gave Jokowi a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again showed symbolic resistance by burying one of the victims on the ground opposite the police station and the army post.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed", says Yacobus, his head in the sand.
What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora blasts the cancellation of the replay of Robert Helenius: "Even the fans don't want to see it"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at Hartwall Arena.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora blames the failure of the rematch entirely on Helenius.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora is rude.
Helenius and Chisora first met in full at Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial penalty.
Ticket sales for the rematch were sluggish, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Evening Standard in May that the match had been postponed to the fall.
Nothing has been heard of the fight since.
But Chisora is no longer upset by the cancellation.
The match would probably have been cancelled anyway, because Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up in excruciating pain.
My tyres were about to explode.
Chisora says that the hospital told me that I needed surgery.
The Brit says he's currently in about 45 percent condition.
I'm guessing he's not interested in a rematch with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora lost to White in December by a split vote.
Fire has once again engulfed the Torch skyscraper in Dubai .
Fires engulfed the world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter-high 79-story building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called the Torch.
The building was evacuated and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was not immediately clear.
We were asleep and we woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes, a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Fire and Rescue Service, firefighters were able to put out the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who had left their homes.
The case may raise new questions about the safety of materials used in high-rise building exteriors around the world.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures at issue in the present case are not imputable to the State.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and curtain panels of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Riosul during the night.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Rio de Janeiro between 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday and 5:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Nineveh at 2 Ladder Road.
Mopo was a Sky Team Monkey.

More than 20 percent of U.S. airline passengers carry prohibited items on board, survey reveals
A survey of airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of U.S. travelers had knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items onto planes past U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints.
Less than 1 percent said they only later learned that they had accidentally carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey, conducted by the charter airline Stratos Jet Charters, asked more than 1,000 passengers, and the results also reveal that younger passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7% were Gen Y, and less than 15% were Gen X.
The most common violation was bringing food and liquids on board.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with knives on board, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men reported knowingly carrying prohibited drugs on board.
The company that conducted the survey, which involved travelers from all over the United States, wanted to know how many had accidentally passed security and how many had done so knowingly.
Not surprisingly, most travellers are also the most likely to pass security checks on smuggled goods  knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids they can take on board and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a time, there was also a perception that books were not allowed on airplanes.
You can take liquids on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
The head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has announced his decision to delay Obama's decision to cut emissions.
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama administration smoke-saving measures.
Pruitt said the change showed that the agency he heads takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a single word about the action brought against his earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Commission has concluded that the measures in question are not in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone implementation of the decisions for a year to give his agency more time to study the plan, as the agency does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth.
Pruitt was the attorney general of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him to head the EPA, and Pruitt is known for his opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA's director exceeded his authority to try to delay the implementation of an Obama administration order against oil and gas companies, which required the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his full reversal of the ozone regulations only reinforces EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process to meet the new requirements on schedule.
Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge it in court to reach an agreement on timelines, Pruitt said.
We do not believe in regulating through the courts and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us.
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use its power to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The motion has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group will continue to press.
"The EPA's change of heart in our lawsuits is a major victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly exposed to smoke in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ozone is produced when emissions from cars, power plants, refineries, and chemical plants react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory distress for sensitive groups and is also responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists were applauding Pruitt's surprise change of direction.
It is worrying how much pressure was put on the guy in charge of our air to use common sense, says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
We must fight the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to operate on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups.
From a supercar manufacturer to a SUV, "it's all Ferrari style".
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a press conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar maker unveils its new five-year plan, reports Automotive News.
All cases of smallpox in Eastern Savona are the same virus type.
The coastal plain's smallpox outbreak is the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savona, reports THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the Ministry of Health and Welfare confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in East Savovo is the same strain as the previous infections.
The THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July in a person from the coastal town of Salzburg is the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savona.
On the basis of this information, all the infections found in East Savovo are related to the first case of asbestos detected in the region in June.
This is good news, because it means we haven't found any other types of smallpox.
However, it is possible that new infections may emerge from the fifth case as early as mid-August, and the epidemic is thus not over yet, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, chief infectious diseases officer at the primary health care center in Soster.
No new or suspected cases of measles have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of their own vaccination coverage, Erkkilä reminds.

Finland prepares for legal screaming
They didn't even consider legalizing the pontiac soup.
The reason behind this is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to alcohol.
Making the squeak at home is legal next year, but there's no legal way to legalize the pontiac soup.
The screech is made by steaming, the pontik by distilling.
The reason for the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
There has been no political will to make the pontifical soup a right for everyone, commented Ismo Tuominen, a government councillor at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing to reform the alcohol law, pontic distillation was not considered for legalization.
It was not brought to the political table either.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
He is a member of the government's parliamentary group which took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
In future, a permit to distil pontik at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial production will also remain subject to authorisation.
The report says that home brewing alcohol will be governed by a simple rule: alcohol can be made at home by using a toilet.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can now legally scream at home.
The government has been trying to simplify the regulations.
The new law will remove the requirements for flavourings and fragrances and allow the production of scallions, Mäkelä explains.
The preparation must also be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings produced by their mixing are clearly visible in the drink.
The new law allows for the making of as much liquor as one wishes and the gifting of alcohol.
It's still not allowed to be sold.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, says Tuominen.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The bill is now under review by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will be introduced in the House of Representatives as soon as the fall season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will come into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's as if the House has already taken a stand.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital with suspected heart failure.
Pistorius's already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his sentence at Atteridgeville State Prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius was suffering from chest pains, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for further tests.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former world-class athlete is doing well.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February of 2013.
The phone records show that Trump was pressuring Mexico to build a wall on the border .
The Washington Post has leaked transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27, 2017, phone call, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop his public statements about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president blasted Nieto for publicly thwarting the wall. "You can't say that to the press", Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which was followed by a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbully that the deal that the United States would take in refugees on their way to Australia was "ridiculous", "sad" and "stupid".
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day".
Georgia massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, and continues on its way to the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and twitches through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
Roger, the man is moaning.
Get out of the car!
The screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-enactment of the one that was shown on July 22, 2017.
However, the sigh of shock is real when the hangman's noose is placed around Roger's neck.
Since 2005, civil rights groups have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reenact the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
It is puzzling that no one has been arrested during all these years  even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are, says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the re-exposure arrangements.
It is a stain on history, but above all it is a burden on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former congressman from Georgia.
For him, the reenactment is a startling call to action, but it also serves as a reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been undone.
We want the guilty to be brought to justice, we want things to be settled, and we want to recover from the grief and make peace, but above all we want justice, says Brooks.
We cannot recover and make peace until we get justice.
The coroner is covering the body of a victim who died in the Georgia massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was ever charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been at large for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Supreme Court of Georgia granted black people the right to vote in presidential elections for the first time, the Supreme Court ruling in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which a black tenant farmer, Roger Malcolm, stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcolm's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said that word was spreading in town that Hester had been having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child with her.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, influential white landowner Loy Harrison posted Malcolm's bail of $600, upon which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
A mob stopped their car outside the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It has been determined that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders", the FBI report states.
It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed evidence and did not reveal the identities of the witnesses.
Brooks is more specific.
"It was a voting rights killing", he says.
They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that they would be killed if they voted.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reenactment of the Georgia massacre for almost a decade.
The play is extremely realistic and captivating, a depiction of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to watch it, which Green says is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides", says the director.
But I can't have a relationship with you if you won't listen to me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through.
This year's rehearsal for the show began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen black and 20 white - gathered to hear Green's routine recap of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is assistant director on Green.
He's been playing a local Ku Klux Klan leader in a re-enactment for years, but the role is always just as difficult and disgusting.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself", says Marbaugh.
It is important, however, that this side of history is also brought to the fore so that it never happens again.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, also known as Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are practicing their lines.
The show opens with Malcolm yelling and pushing Hester, angry that Hester has been having an affair with Dorothy.
I said get the fuck off my land!
Rascona, or Hester, is on the phone.
Then the punch.
And then everybody (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I hit you too hard by accident?" he asks.
No, Greene is babbling.
I just don't think white people used the word "n-n-u" back then.
Yes, another black actor confirms it.
It's slang, you have to use the longer version.
I know the subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room is filled with a lot of guys.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the show, but to honor the memory of those who died.
The scene starts over.
Now Rascona's words are disrespectful.
No one laughs.
The reenactment ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies singing Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks at every second he says it.
A few hundred feet away, 50 onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half the audience is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to see a play from Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They've been visiting the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have been turned from a story into reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing, Greene calls the crowd to examine the bodies.
Children bend over to look at the fake blood and the immovable bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead", the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the lynchers took off their cloaks and wiped their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh, a man who poses as a local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a brutal performance.
Don't worry, the lady in the show will comfort you.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and the actors gather for a dinner.
A white couple returning from the pool are having a lively discussion about the play with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinsky has a hard time finding words to describe the emotions that the show evokes.
It is difficult to hear horrible words and watch horrible things said and done by people who look like you  precisely because they look like you, he says.
My presentation made me realize that lynchings continue to happen, he added. They are simply called arrests.
On the other side of the room, Brooks is recounting the progress of civil rights to the audience at his table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
Remaster is a powerful experience because it captures the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience, says Brooks.
The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.
The hanging of plants in shops is a cause for alarm: This is the real saving of removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of cauliflower before weighing?
How about taking the big hat off the pineapple, no matter how much it weighs?
The answers are sharply divided: for some it is an indication of extreme picking, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables they do not use that still go to waste at home.
The phenomenon is recognizable in the stores.
For example, the K-City vegetable section of the Green Bay City Market in Helsinki has cardboard boxes, as many people tear off the leaves of cauliflower, for example.
The leaves are taken from the box to the store for biowaste.
According to a report in the Financial Times, shopkeepers are surprised by the peep at the vegetable counter.
But how much money does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save?
How significant is the snoring device?
We women tested how the price changes when pineapple, peach, rose, broccoli and cauliflower are removed or cut.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower that cost €2.10 was reduced to €1.80 when all the leaves were removed.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, which cost $2.30, dropped to $1.95 when its stalk was twisted.
Flat-leaf artichoke: The price of 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when the short-leaf was cut off.
Spices: Two spices cost 75 cents each.
Without the stock, it's 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost $1.00 (U.S.) and a broccoli without a stalk cost $1.00.
The result: If leaves and stems are plucked, a few inches are saved on a single vegetable, at best.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 percent.
So, for these purchases, a total of 1.20 euros would have been saved!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona . The bronze star has signed a five-year contract with PSG .
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, AFP news agency reports.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buy-out to FC Barcelona, a Spanish football club.
The transfer of 222 million euros is the biggest in football history.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league delayed the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first bid for a transfer fee.
The league rules state that the purchasing team cannot pay the buy-out directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid Neymar and his representatives, who have supplied the money to Barcelona through the league.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He's likely to be introduced to a new home crowd at PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA is looking into the details .
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the alleged infringement of Article 108 (3) TFEU.
Among others, the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, has alleged that PSG is violating UEFA's rules of financial fair play in its financial management.
UEFA can penalise a club that makes more than 30 million euros in losses over three years.
UEFA has said that Neymar's move does not automatically violate its financial protocol.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will have an impact on the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial sums, UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar State-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from a lightning strike. The flash was captured on an airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal business arrangements for the plane at Lounas International Airport in Florida with a couple of colleagues when suddenly lightning struck the plane from a rainy sky.
The force of the lightning knocked the plane to the ground near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother had an electrical shock and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a hard experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
The airport representative said that the lightning warning system was on at the time of the incident and that the carrier would decide whether to comply with it.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividends
Pearson, a British education group, said on Friday it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut profits by 72 percent as it embarks on a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the main job cuts will be made in late 2018 and early 2019, with the company already cutting 4,000 jobs in the context of previous restructuring arrangements.
Pearson announced further cost cuts of £300 million in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive a business weakened by rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, which said it would keep its outlook for the year unchanged, with first-half sales up 1% to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul, NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has struck a military base in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to authorities.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded in the strike.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Karabakh area of Kabul.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, with 30 people killed in a blast at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomb attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked with a homemade explosive device carried by a person.
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Karabakh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, a predominantly Shiite area.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the deadliest attack by the militant group in the country since US-led forces toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local military and police.
The correspondents also said that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks had seriously undermined public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA suspends its decision to suspend the implementation of the smoke regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay implementation of Obama administration smoke-reduction measures a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called consensus definitions late on Wednesday, which the agency said was a sign of its commitment to working with states.
We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states, said Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mainly Democratic states, including the District of Columbia, alleging that the stay of execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to ease environmental regulations under Barack Obama, which Trump says are part of a broader program to boost economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA's website, breathing ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior ISIS figure had also sent parts for the bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be carried on the plane on July 15, but the attempt was aborted before the security check.
The police won't say why the attempt was aborted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to separate toxic colorless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transportation system.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plot was one of the most professional ever devised in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday in connection with suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but he too is being questioned.
CEO of Liquid: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's pre-tax profit fell but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company performed well in oil products, sales of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of operating profit in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievosen, the operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even after the end of the tax relief.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have previously announced in 2017.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomashenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting .
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course for the most exciting fight in the under-66.7kg division in the near future, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their rooms in the ESPN sports channel's offices in Los Angeles, until undefeated WBC lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatchenko, the WBO's top featherweight champion.
Garcia won Saturday's showtime bout against former heavyweight world champion Adrien Broner by unanimous decision, and since then, Garcia and Lomashenko have been in the top five of a comparison of heavyweight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?"
Good luck with the fight!
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday at 7:00.
When the pair posed for photographs, Lomatchenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a match between the men would be perfect for their sizes.
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia reminded me.
I moved up the ranks for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for a hundred and thirty-five pounds.
I want to get back to the lightweight division.
He's got to get up to the lightweight division, then we can fight.
That's what our fans hope.
Let's grant their wishes.
Lomachenko was in agreement.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a pay channel, part of his strategy for Lomachenko, who will make his lightweight debut later this year and face Garcia (370, 30 knockouts) next summer.
"The fight could be on a pay channel because the fans have asked for it", Garcia said, later announcing that he was willing to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
We're the most interesting names.
No one else is getting as much attention as you.
I'm fine with it. Once we make a deal...
Garcia said he admires Lomachenko as an incredible fighter and might go to see the game on Saturday.
Lomaschenko interrupted Garcia's complimentary speech and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked really slow.
Garcia said he was focused on hitting first, then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was becoming more and more desirable.
This is the fight they've been waiting for.
No other fight has attracted as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely in on this case, Garcia said.
Lomchenko said he was looking forward to fighting the best.
It's going to be a great fight.
Average salary €5,300, education whatever happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a topic of much discussion lately.
Last week, Helsingin Sanomat reported on Ritva, 68, who was told by investment advisers at a bank to sell investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will come into force at the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the requirements for competence.
The Financial Industry Authority (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service take its own APV1 or APV2 examination.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of the examinations by a company called APV-investeringsstudiet Oy, whose examination team includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The examinations are of 12 to 15 credits and are prepared by Aalto EE, the provider of management development services, Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
The website of the organization says that in general, both exams are "quite broad in terms of requirements".
The academic material of the degree programmes includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investments Research Oy, says that the pass rate for the exams is roughly estimated at about 70.
Almost all the staff of the largest banks providing investment services have either an APV1 or APV2 qualification, as they are required by the company's own rules.
Then there are the smaller banks, without naming them, whose staff seem to have avoided completing their degrees, Savikko says.
He said there were "a few" such banking operations.
According to Savikon, between 13 000 and 14 000 persons have completed the APV1 qualification since 2000 and around 3 000 persons have completed the APV2 qualification, which is recommended for more demanding investment advisors.
Some banking institutions consider a degree an advantage.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation from the Finance Ministry requires the completion of APV exams, because then the expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to the Statistical Office, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros a month, including commissions, benefits in kind and profit-sharing bonuses.
The average monthly earnings of regular employees are around EUR 5 300.
Men in employment earn on average over EUR 5 900 a month and women over EUR 4 500 respectively.
The top 10 earners earn on average about EUR 8 100.
One tenth of the highest-earning men earn more than EUR 9 000 a month or more, and one tenth of the highest-earning women earn EUR 6 400 or more.
The following are the types of investment advisory services:
The employee and the job have hitherto relied on self-regulation.
According to FIBA, its audit identified individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not adequate due to the activities of the advisor.
In principle, even a low level of skill and qualifications can be used to sell investment products.
In principle, the situation in this respect has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter competence requirements, Savikko notes.
According to Savikon, the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II) will tighten this up from the beginning of next year.
It requires that each firm is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently qualified.
The financial controls will have the power to decide what is to be done.
According to Marko Hovi, FIVA's market watchdog, one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the requirement for the skills and experience of investment advisers and sellers of investment products.
The Court held that the new requirements apply both to the own staff of investment firms and to the agents who sell products on behalf of an undertaking.
The Court stated that the government's proposal from the Ministry of Finance gives Fiva the power to determine the expertise and experience.
What they are, we'll have to decide in the autumn.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, where necessary, follow-up and further training.
This all needs to be documented and the company has an obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The Court states that in practice, for example, a company must assess the performance of its staff on an individual basis.
This will certainly be of different standard depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
The Court also found that the requirement to work with someone with more experience for a fixed period of time if the skill or experience is not at a sufficient level is new.
So if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the criteria, the employee must work with the qualified person for a certain period of time.
The court said the change would make the rules more stringent and concrete.
The Commission will also assess the impact of the measures on the financial situation of the Union.

The flight path was mapped over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was made on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines for long-haul endurance.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew a distance of 9,500 miles (15,700 km) in 18 hours and 1 minute - longer than any regular commercial airline in the world.
The flight was within the United States' borders for the entire duration of the flight.
It flew through 17 states in total.
The persevering beach school children of Imatra are not shaken by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen persistently polished with the help of a swimming rod
Iines Kokkonen was moving at a good pace, Taina Iines Kokkonen was following.
The schools on the coast of Imatra are running in Liette and Lempukka this week and next.
Even though it rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not shy, says swim school director Taina Itkonen.
This week, 13 kids are getting their swimming lessons, next week, a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and eskar is already starting, estimates Itkonen.
The coastal school is organised by the Movement Unites project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, the atmosphere was pleasant on the beach in Liette.
The sun was shining and the young swimming students were practicing staying afloat with the bathing boots, some even without.
The little brothers and sisters also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaiko, 5, first thought of going deeper into the water.
But the weeping cloud encouraged him to bounce toward the shore.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me that he went swimming a lot this summer.
The beach is nice for her.
Like all the others, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming with a swimming stick and persevered.
You should be happy about today's achievements, too.
My grandfather, Kallio, 4, wanted to go to the water.
Ilona Villberg, who has been following her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swimming on the beach, considers beach school a good start to learning to swim.
Even though the weather has been a little rough, Anna has always loved coming here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
The boys had enough of the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, nibbling on fruit and chatting about the day.
The lesson was already in the water, but there was no hurry on the pier.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier is selling toilet brushes.
You see all kinds of things.
A few days ago, the cleaning company Blue Products launched the Unknown Soldier line.
I mean, dishbrushes and laundry detergents and a toilet brush with a brush on the edge.
The Unknown Soldier refers to a movie that's coming out this fall and the marketing of the movie.
But there's something special about the combination, and the products have been laughed at on social media: When are the Unknown Health Bonds coming?
I need to call the company and find out what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, the vice president of Blue Products, have to say?
We're the film partners.
We're supporting this film, like many other ventures.
We wanted to support a domestic production and a cult film, says Määttä.
He says that the products will be given a special label and the film will be seen.
Isn't there something a little funny about this, often when you think about the products and the stories that go with them?
"We are a Finnish company and these are Finnish products", says Määttä.
He said the company shares his basic Finnish values with those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not unfamiliar to military culture, Mast notes.
Other partners of the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall's whippersnaps have been introduced under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
The unknown products have already been cancelled by the Finnish magazine Kalle Kinnunen
There's coffee and watches available now.
Kinnunen points out that the film's premiere is still early, so there's still time to go.
The unknown partners have not yet disclosed their war products, such as Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish age tests for asylum seekers published
The latest results of the medical age tests of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published.The results of the new assessment methodology reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests allow a more accurate assessment of the age of the asylum seeker, a new test introduced after criticism of the Swedish Migration Agency for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Migration Agency has carried out 6 880 tests to date and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the 2002 asylum seekers tested, 80% were determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases the Forensic Office determined that the test subject was possibly 18 years of age or older.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was possibly under 18 years of age.
The tests were only carried out in cases where there were reasons to doubt the age claimed by the applicant.
The results are consistent with those of previous months, says Johan Göransson, of the Forensic Medicine Office.
The figures are fairly consistent, with no major differences from previous months, he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified as being over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that 442 cases had 'indications that the subject was 18 years of age or older'.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly said that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical method of age assessment used in the tests, which involves X-rays of the wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the kneecaps, is also criticized by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Caroline Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
I have had reason to think about this and I do not think the method used is the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with certainty, we should not pretend we can", he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Office defended the accuracy of the tests: In general, the risk of determining the child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest when the test subject is about to turn 18 years old, when the risk is about 10%.
Joy fell 30 places in Scotland .
Five over-pars in the third round took Mikko Ilosen 30 points down the score line in a European Tour golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left Saturday in 11th place, but was found in 41st place at the end of the round.
Joy was in a tough fight, with three bogs and one double bog.
It was hard for everyone else.
Ian Poulter of England took the lead with one lap to go, even though he said it was a lot of work to hold an umbrella.
The party was rough, but I stuck with it, and it was a good day, Poulter said.
He shares the top spot with fellow countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodd.
The governor of West Virginia is changing parties .
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he's switching parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me", Justice said.
"Today, I can tell you after much prayer and thought, "I can tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as Democratic governor".
The audience broke out in a rousing applause.
"Tomorrow I will register as a Republican", Justice added.
As your coach, I'd say it's time for another game.
Trump earlier promised that a major announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining business and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that Governor Justicé's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to build barriers to a better America.
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this context, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that lacks leadership and cannot find a positive message that unites people", RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
♪ Lightning has done so much damage ♪ Thursday is coming ♪ Even the summer's most violent wedding day
There will be more thunderstorms in southern Finland this weekend.
During the past week, thunder has been particularly strong in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Mainland Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, several fires were started by lightning strikes.
The weatherman says Thursday may be the hottest day of summer so far.
The thunder deaf have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has struck mainly in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Mainland Finland.
At the table, lightning struck the power station in the front of the building, causing a small fire.
The fire was reported to the emergency services at about 1:15 a.m. on Wednesday.
The power plant was in a sauna at the end of a row house.
The rescue team dismantled the roof and wall to find the fire extinguishers and quickly put out the fire.
Eleven homes were without power, but no injuries were reported.
In the Loima area, lightning struck the outer building on Harjulanti before midnight.
When the rescue team arrived, the building was already full at the time of the fire, and the rescue team had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
The building, which was about 50 square meters in size, burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopion in Räkkylä, another lightning struck the private house.
Residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
Rescue workers went to the scene to check on the fire, but this time it was not caused by lightning - only a few burns.
In traffic, lightning caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoen and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The fault was reported between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday morning, after which the trains in the interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until a little before five in the afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has been able to continue normally even on the thunderstorm-stricken section.
The lightning has wreaked havoc all over Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely devastating! estimates meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, a weather officer at the National Weather Service.
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but with the slight lightning bolt of summer, many feel that they are even stronger.
This might seem like a really loud thunder, but it was compared to this summer's thunder, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, 1,700 earthquakes occurred, and Thursday has the potential to be the summer's worst day of thunder: by about 4 p.m., 1,790 earthquakes were on the billboard.
If the lightning continues into the early hours of the morning, more than 2,000 may be expected, predicts Tuovinen.
The last record low lightning year was in 2015, when the annual number of lightning events was about 30 000.
By Wednesday, the number of lightning strikes this year had risen to 18,386.
So there is still a lot to be done to ensure that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
But you can expect the thunderclap to continue.
According to Imovinen, the air above Finland remains warm and humid during the weekend, making it a favorable environment for thunderbirds to breed.
The main thunder will shift on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 days of lightning may be experienced on both Saturday and Sunday.
The promise of a more unified front in the middle of the country.
In a place like this, Tuovisen says, there's only a few thunders.
Coe praises Russia's "cooperative" apology for the doping scandal
World sports authority Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a frank apology from Russia on Thursday over the doping scandal, but added that it was not yet time to lift the ban.
Russia's sporting director, Dmitri Shlyahtin, told the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he would fight doping with determination.
He said he was sorry for all the athletes who were stripped of their gold or silver medals in competitions.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban, and Russia was banned from athletics in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct, it was a very open-minded presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
The entire Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Athletic Federation acknowledged that the country was going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything to reorganise its activities.
He also welcomed the fact that Russia had agreed to the terms of the lifting of the ban.
I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian embargo, Coe said.
We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been to keep clean athletes out of the corrupt system', he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in the neutral athlete status at the World Championships in Athletics in London starting Friday, having met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
IAAF working group head Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has many requirements to meet before its status can be restored.
Tests remain inadequate and the banned coaches remain free to operate, he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland.
The film Tom of Finland did not succeed as the makers hoped, Yle reports.
To be honest, I'm disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Helsinki Film's managing director Annika Sucksdorff Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that they are.
The film was released in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached just over 100,000 viewers, a comparatively small number for the film's budget of about five million euros.
This didn't turn out to be a lottery win, but right now, it's important that investors get their money back.
If the movie had done better at home, they would have gotten their money by now.
Now we have to expect small streams from the outward expansion, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the use of funds by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player transfer in football history.
The possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, the European football governing body, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the Financial Fair Play Rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was financed without large losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros to terminate the Brazilian contract and Neymar's annual salary at the new club is in the tens of millions of dollars.
There are a lot of financial aspects to Neymar's move to France.
PSG have no problem paying Neymar's transfer fee and joining their star guard, as they are financing Qatar's oil-rich ruling family.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of an advantage in the form of State aid.
The rules of the game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, a Frenchman elected UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that trying to succeed by taking on debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the financial rules of fair play shifted from club debts to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 became significantly difficult to implement.
The current three-year evaluation period of the Fair Play Rules runs until 2018 and clubs are allowed to make a maximum of EUR 30 million in losses during that period.
Although Platini was forced to resign as UEFA president in a scandalous move in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb clubs' wasteful spending.
The rules of fair play remain in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future, Andrea Traverso, UEFA's head of fair play economics, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract as a lump sum, it can break it down into the accounts for the duration of his new contract.
The Commission notes that the transfer of the assets of the two companies was not subject to the conditions laid down in the 2005 SGEI Decision.
The first penalties were imposed in 2014 under the rules of the fair play economy, with the biggest penalties being imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
The Commission also found that the French authorities had not provided any evidence that the aid was necessary to cover the costs of the operation.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA does not count the aid as an actual result.
The Commission also notes that the aid was granted to the airport operator in the form of a public service compensation scheme.
It has also emerged that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be financed by fees available from the Qatar Organising Committee for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar is being made an ambassador for the World Cup, and UEFA would be very easy to expose such an arrangement.
With PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is more than ever monitoring attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG for Neymar's transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they have no authority to discuss the situation at PSG.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the French authorities on the measures in question.
The financial statements for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of football equipment and shirts.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar contract.
The Spanish league, clearly angered by the departure of one of the world's greatest players, tried to make it harder for Neymar to move, claiming it violated the economic rules of fair play.
This is a clear case of economic doping by both the club and the state, said Spanish league president Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also wary of the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports mogul.
"This case is the result of an ownership case that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
Anything is possible once the state owns the football team.
The economic rules of fair play will be very difficult to follow, because there are so many different interests involved in having a famous player represent the state.
The coach of the Finnish World Cup athletes is stuck in Helsinki .
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though she should be coaching the athletics at the World Championships in London.
Kristina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach's advice.
Tomorrow, the Pajulahti will compete in the long jump and Saturday, the Mäkelä will compete in the triple jump.
However, the coach of the pair, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British Embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a document, but that's not even a visa.
I wonder if these are the first symptoms of Brexit or what, head coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He's always handled visa matters himself successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's gonna do whatever it takes to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation for many years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the footprints in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach about the possible absence.
A World Cup medal for Finland from London will require a miracle .
The World Championships in Athletics will begin in London this Friday and will last for a fair week ending on Sunday, August 13.
Outdoor sports, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they succeed or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less noticeable are the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prestigious competition to another, where experience is gained to mature the athlete's performance to the point where an adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now the small Finnish World Cup team has no such young athletes, even if they are competitors.
A World Cup medal for Finland would require a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising thing about sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench players to the television screen and sticks them to the games, even though the London medals are not decided until late in the evening because of the time difference.
In the previous World Championships in Athletics, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear thrower, Tero Longshanks.
The Daredevils are still waiting for a medal from Pitkakan, although the other is his recent performance and that of other pitchers, including Pitkakan's elimination from last summer's qualifiers.
Whatever happened in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, qualifying for the final or setting a personal record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will give a good success in the international competitions of young people this summer.
The development of young talent and the financial support of its work are more important than maintaining a small elite team of representative athletes.
Success does not come overnight, but it requires years of sweat work on the part of athletes and patience on the part of coaches and bench players alike.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope the London race will go down in history as the race between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorism or attacks on poor people.
"But it's a shame"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has placed second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second-place finish is the best in the Big Air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
The lake scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and I feel good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go well.
I'm gonna try that again in the races from now on, inch of a hand.
In big air snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a specially made ski jump.
Viking Line 's new high-speed ship docked in Helsinki
Viking's new high-speed ship, the FSTR, is seriously behind schedule.
The express was scheduled to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There were eight countries on board, loading.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
I've been waiting for at least an hour and a half to get on the boat.
Now the line is moving a little, said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board a ship in Helsinki harbour at 7.30.
Rebane thought the new ship had a technical failure.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting in their cars to get on board.
Viking's communications director, Christa Grönlund, is telling IS that there was a technical glitch.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the boat will be a couple of hours late for the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was scheduled to leave Tallinn for Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
A 42-meter special transport is disrupting traffic on Sixth Avenue Thursday night.
A special transport, 42 meters long, will be moving from Muuk to the port of Mustola on Thursday night.
The 9:00 transport should be here by 11:00 p.m.
Police are directing traffic on Sixth Avenue, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the point of impact, the transportation will proceed along Route 13 to Mustola Harbor.
Nostalgia of a small circle:
The story simultaneously looks back at the glory days of the characters in the '80s and the grunge of the '90s (when David Wain and Michael Showalter made the great sketch comedy series The State for MTV) and back to their own time in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the rest of the show's stars moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it's both a parody and a description of the constant memory we're stuck with in the age of Facebook.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's out of date.
First Day of Camp did surprisingly well, and not only because of its absurd humor (which was told, among other things, as the backstory of a can of vegetables with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The point of the joke is that the middle-aged actors play passionate teenagers approaching adulthood, and the emphasis on that makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional and its parody is more fragmented, parodying, for example, the stalker reels of the 1990s, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the figures digs up an Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and other stuff from 1991.
A lot of the stories are the same as before.
Goodhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor is still a virgin.
And in one crazy plot, Ronald Reagan (aka Michael Showalter) is involved as an accomplice to George H. W. Bush (played fittingly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this kind of show, the best part is the side effects.
It's especially fun to see a young Paul Rudd with a shaved patch under his lower lip, which is Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from Singles.
The moments of random madness may lift this series into the air as a kind of recurring Seven Up! series until it reaches its apparent conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer  Twenty Years Later.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the movie Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series' East meets West button-down.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy series is a Romanian-made 1980s police drama about a Bucharest cop couple fighting for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles, played by the tough-faced Gregor and the idealistic Josephine, are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with English dubbing by Channing Tatum (head producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
The show has some good visual jokes (police spend time watching chess on TV the way Americans watch football).
And we're gonna have a bunch of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, and they're gonna make a fun bong game.
Comrade Detective, however, gets too caught up in the clumsy socialist drama of a serial killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, which is why the show often feels like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes is too long, and the humor isn't fast enough or rich enough.
In a condensed form, the series might be more of an agitprop satire, as in the case of Gregor and Joseph, who make repeated visits to the U.S. Embassy and are always surrounded by two fat men eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make anything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we swallowed our own recent history and theirs as well.
Toni Tauru of Kouvola will take the ring in Macau on Saturday against former UFC fighter
Tony Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru is going to face a tough fight in Macau, because Leandro Issa of Brazil fought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also holds a black belt in jujutsu and a world championship in the sport.
For once, I'm gonna take on my own parent.
It's a funny story, 32 year old Tauru tells.
The Kouvola was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three matches were rushed to the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau.
The plague has never faced anything like this before.
This is the first time my fight was canceled.
It was annoying because it took a long time to prepare and train.
But the fighter is pleased that a new moment of struggle has been reached.
I'm afraid waiting a week won't affect the preparation.
The transplant won't affect his condition because it won't improve in a week.
If you exercise too much, your fitness may worsen.
In his last few fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in their uprightness.
This time, it's different.
A Cuban describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter, you know.
I bet he'll come at you hard in the first round and try to knock you out.
He's won the world jujutsu championship, so he can wrestle.
The last fight the Kouvola had didn't go as planned.
Kevin Belingon of the Philippines hit Taura hard in the corner of the eye, and the win went to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially upright: he didn't get a single hit.
When I was out pouring, he hit me in the corner of the eye.
It's been a really long time.
New motivation
Some of the volunteers fight once a year, some get in the ring more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Taurus, on the other hand, had three fights last year.
Now we're in for the second fight of the year.
Sometimes the rhythm has gotten heavy.
I've been training for the last few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the pleasure of doing it back.
We had some really good training with a guy from Sweden.
Practice was a big help, for on Saturday the Kouvois have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been training against opponents my own size and practicing the upright.
I mean, fighting back is a 32-year-old's primary tactic.
You gotta hit him with your head.
If I get a chance, I'll take you to the property myself.
The sub-exports must not be given away for free, as they are the most expensive.
Macau is more attractive than the Taurus that was fought in China earlier.
They say it's the Las Vegas of China.
I think we're in for a big, great night.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep rates unchanged once economic growth has been flat and the slowdown in inflation has ended speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, and it has postponed interest rate hikes because of increasing pressure on household income levels.
The decision-makers of the central bank's monetary policy committee voted 62 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, an increase that has been even less popular this month because of the stagnation in economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation survey, the Bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned of further pressure on household income levels as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank believes that interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to contain Brexit-induced inflation and that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The Committee also decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that was launched a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide an additional GBP 15 million, or a total of GBP 115 million, of low-cost funding to banks through the scheme.
The Bank's minutes of the interest rate decision state: The Monetary Policy Committee forecasts that the slowdown in GDP will continue in the coming years, as the fall in real household incomes dampens consumption.
On interest rates, the Bank reiterated that to contain inflation, some monetary policy tightening was needed slightly more broadly than market expectations.
The market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that any increases would be gradual and limited.
In May, the Bank forecast growth of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 against the dollar and by 0.4% to €1.11 against the euro.
The decision to keep rates unchanged was taken after weaker than expected growth levels dampened expectations of higher interest rate increases.
The Bank expects growth to remain stable at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation survey gave little hope for households suffering from soaring inflation and meager wage increases, and the bank said the situation would get worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy could not prevent the decline in income in the coming years, but that it expected wage developments to recover significantly at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision came a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% following a shock EU referendum result that sent the pound plummeting.
The Bank considers that the full effects of the decision are likely to start to be felt in terms of prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the recent decision by the central bank, demands for rate increases had become more and more vocal as inflation increased pressure on households.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the Bank said it was expected to tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess over its 2% target was overall due to the weak pound.
Given the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the housing market under the Competition Act appears to be tightening as lenders are eager to find customers and to end the year strong, says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
The market is particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end.
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Since September, patients can be prescribed a "reversible" HIV-prevention drug, the Supreme Court has decided a dispute over funding of the drug in England's public healthcare system (NHS).
The NHS reported that PrEP is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three years of the trial.The drug, taken before intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 per cent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS could pay for PrEP, even though it claims that local authorities should fund it.
The NHS England chief, Simon Stevens, called Thursday's decision "a significant new intervention" and the national AIDS organisation described it as "a decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting registrations for the trial, which will be extended to other clinics in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in those at risk.
Taking a medicine before sex means that you have enough medicines in your body to prevent HIV infection during sex.
You can take it every day or two hours before sex.
The target group is gay, bisexual and transgender men and people with an HIV-positive partner who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants from men, women and transgender people, as well as from those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in GP care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million and the NHS in England signed a procurement agreement for the drugs this week following an international tender.
The aim of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, administration and delivery.
This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the already diverse and increasingly effective means of HIV prevention, says Stevens.
Another major achievement in the more than 30-year fight to tackle one of humanity's greatest health challenges.
This is a critical moment in the fight against HIV, says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Foundation.
If PrEP is properly targeted at those who need it and at risk, it could have a major impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, a trial funded by the NHS will give people at risk a medicine they can decide on on their own, without the need to consult a partner, with a powerful impact that will improve the lives of so many people.
This was welcome news.
It is now crucial to ensure that the trial is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left out, says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
The PrEP drug used in the trial has been procured and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.
The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome development, which was delayed for months by government delays, says Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
We have evidence that the drug can have a revolutionary impact on the work we are doing to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this menacing disease.
The trial will help us to understand more about the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those at risk of HIV and get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.
Quality of life: a second floor and clever interior design have transformed the small Earl's Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for property renovation, moved from a residential area in Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house built in the style of the Queen Anne era.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge", Joanne says.
I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to this apartment for a home inspection and I noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment at the time.
I fell in love with him instantly and made him an offer the same day.
Since then, the approximately 300-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-bedroom, with the only access to the bedroom from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and a mezzanine floor to take advantage of the height of the room.
I wanted space, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design firm in Notting Hill to use the space of the nearly 13-foot-tall rooms to create an apartment that would be not just a place to renovate and sell but a home.
The room was not quite high enough for two overlapping rooms, so the challenge was to build a middle floor that would fit.
The solution required creative thinking on Erfan's part.
Steel structures are rather complex.
The rooms had to be stacked so that they didn't have to be squatting.
The structures had to be adjusted to the right height, both above and below.
Erfan was able to arrange two high-rise rooms in the space, one above the other, with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, the Retrouvius copper-glazed window opens onto the elegant living room.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver effects and vintage lamps of Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short hallway make the hallway seem farther away.
A mirror in the kitchen is like a window that opens onto another room.
The mirrored furniture in the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
Adding to the style is the ability to hide the kitchen when it's not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution.
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised up the same way as the garage door.
It took a bit of planning, Erfan says of the steel-reinforced MDF slit-door.
It is balanced, which means that it slides very easily when lifted.
With careful use and storage, Joanne was given 16 extra square feet, another bedroom, and an even better floor plan.
When selling a home, the area determines  or the value of the property, says Erfan.
In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.
Joann's apartment was enlarged by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
The occupant is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional bond to the dwelling is partly based on them, says Erfan.
Nobody gets attached to electrical wires running through walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and additional furnishings can make a basic home exceptionally beautiful.
It may also be that you no longer want to move out.
Princess Sofia , pregnant , was radiant in her summer locks .
Princess Sofia's choice of outfit was a good one.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a henna pink dress.
Sofia was the smiling representative at the ceremony.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has been visiting Båstad, Sweden, this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was representing the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body suit that dressed a beautifully pregnant princess in her final years.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue suit.
This is the last performance Sofia will ever perform before she is born.
His due date is September.
For the dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel-purple dress that came off beautifully.
The crowning glory of style was the big earrings and the fancy little bag.
The pastel blue dress is a beautiful princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden, this week on a delegation trip.
Sofia completed her outfit with a little bag.
Sofia was literally radiating in her fresh summer locks.
Sofia was so excited about the event, she even talked to the photographers.
"Now I'm just holding my stomach", Sofia said, laughing, pointing to her final pregnancy.
He 's raising us with sweet chili .
In the summer of 1996, a small house with Thai food appeared in the Lahti market.
The people from the lake didn't dare to taste it. They walked right past.
In the house, Panya Suamsri-Pentti, known to Panja, sold food.
He knew little Finnish, and the Finns at that time did not yet know Thai.
Since people didn't dare to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the people of the Gulf to eat Thai food, spring rolls at a time.
He said, "Taste of the land".
I was hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened a Thai restaurant in the Bay Mall.
There were two little tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
She taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and space is limited, you can't leave an empty chair between you and your guest.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at a plate with a dictionary and learned Thai.
I spent two years in the mall, but then the restaurant had to move because they said the homemade spice pans smelled too bad in the hall.
There's a new place at the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now we jurors are back at our own tables, only at rush hour we're too shy to ask our guests for space.
Panja knows her client.
He'll be told where he's been, who he's seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He's seen the customers change stages of life and change the company.
She remembers the man I went out with for my first spring roll.
He remembers me as skinny and fat and remembers me as a young man.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my own seat by the kitchen door and exchange words with Panja leaning against the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He's taught us about tolerance and international relations with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our taste buds but also our minds and hearts.
Now many people speak Thai to him, thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's a hard worker.
She's been working at the restaurant. She's been eating mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated its 20th anniversary.
We customers had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any noise or attention, this important day passed, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
The security authorities obtained a list of significant counter-terrorism activities at the beginning of the year.
The list contains information on over 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the document contains not only their personal details but also photographs of each of the 173 individuals.
More than 130 of those on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also on the list.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The Evening News gave me the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been refined.
According to the paper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorist IDs and photos while searching an underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The US intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in Europe in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious was planned in the West by terrorists in the Middle East after the defeat of ISIS.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the individuals, but also their dates of birth, their fictitious aliases, and information about their country of origin.
The list also identifies the specific areas of terrorism.
For example, the name of Sami J., a 27-year-old German, on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then to Libya and then via Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
Next to his picture, it says "suicide bomber".
There's no further information on the man's fate.
The European Union has already taken action to combat terrorism.
A man went under the surface of the lake in Helsinki's Tokoinranta.
According to interviews with the rescue service, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
A bucket can save a drowning life.
A person who was submerged in water was rescued on Thursday in Helsinki's Tokoi Beach.
According to Ville Estlander, a firefighter on duty at the Helsinki Fire and Rescue Service, the situation was quickly over.
The victim was found underwater about 15 minutes after the call.
A rescue diver found her under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue unit got a call just after 2:30 this afternoon.
The victim was taken to the emergency room.
Estlander says it was a man in his 50s.
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation on the beach is over.
The Estlander Group is grateful for the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
This was a Border Patrol-led operation.
The divers were also given excellent guidance by the local people.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Patrol and the police.
Two cars collided in Eureka. Nine people in the cars, three seriously injured.
A total of nine people were in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, says the fire chief on duty.
The wounded include both men and women.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads at about four in the afternoon.
The accident occurred when the second car turned in front of the other car behind the warning triangle, says the on-call fire chief.
According to the emergency services, the speed limit at the intersection is 50 miles per hour.
The brothers are fighting over over $ 500 million in real estate .
Two brothers are locked in a dispute over Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth more than $500 million, over a family business founded by their Italian ancestors 40 years ago.
Former Carlton Football Club chairman and property developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak area, just three blocks from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over the division of property and business between the brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has been wanting to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is in bitter dispute.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties together worth over half a billion dollars.
The family established a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded to a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to the agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns real estate worth approximately $316 million and Paul owns real estate worth approximately $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the way the real estate and the money are being split.
I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal, Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also fighting over who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of the business.
Colin says that's not true, that he's accusing Paul of some of the poor management of some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to see the case resolved.
In line with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me, Colin says in his statement.
The cost of this case is constantly increasing, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports, and the case is being investigated by consulting firms like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, along with some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, including Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who established dairy bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of a property in Collingwood, where Colin established the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started the shop in his last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass the property on to their sons in a friendly way.
Lug often said that he did not want the brothers to go to court, Anna wrote in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business, and according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "grief-stricken" about the financial terms of their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul DeLutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he texted me that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it was being heard in court.
It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and bring our family name to the court fight, he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
Our father would not have wanted us to fight like this, Colin continued, saying he still hoped the matter would be resolved.
On Friday, it seemed that hope had died.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future", wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First of all.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump's media use and news coverage to keep the boss from getting into trouble as often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he raised a key problem he plans to solve: he plans to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House staff that all information  whether in print or in press conferences  must be passed through him because the president makes better decisions when he has good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television  and as president he still watches a lot of television.
If Trump was upset by unfair news coverage, he should have shown that the sympathetic media was more fair, Sam Nunberg, a Trump campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico reporter Tara Palmer wrote that six former campaign workers said that a steady stream of praise is essential to Trump's control of Twitter.
- I got it.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's Twitter use was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't  maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more outrageous without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have been able to stop him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has consistently been able to stop Trump from causing a stir.
Part of the problem is that there are competing factions in the White House that try to get their way by giving Trump information that supports their viewpoint, which may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico reported that advisers were deliberately giving the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told of one incident:
Trump's current and former employees say he can get very angry at newspaper articles criticizing him especially if they report harmful leaks.
That happened in late February when someone shamelessly gave the president a copy of a story on GotNews.com, a website founded by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of multiple White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment and had previously spread false accusations and later retracted them, and he had not provided any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started after reading the story and asking staff about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "attempted to introduce a management system for documents going to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still running their own affairs.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's task extremely difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG .
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, AFP news agency reports.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buy-out to FC Barcelona, a Spanish football club.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to Paris-based club PSG.
The transfer of 222 million euros is the biggest in football history.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar State-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Bestselling author Raija Oranen overcame alcoholism and flying by hypnosis: "I'm fine in my life"
The bestselling author of the TV series Rose Time and The Clean White Sheets, Raija Oranen, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Your hypnosis helped Rayya Oras.
Five grandchildren are so attached to their grandmother that she and her husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and their apartment in Fuengirola after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but this spring they moved out of their apartment.
To the light and sunshine, out of the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has recovered from.
Even the outside is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to drop when they stopped taking the serotonin pills, which were mood medications.
I got help for my alcoholism once, hypnosis, which also worked on my fear of flying. I overcame it.
I've been sober for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a man, says the brilliant writer.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling the same path for over 45 years.
I'm better than I've ever been.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been walking together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was to be married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
She's always been such a drama queen, she ended her life with that, Jyrki laughing at his wife.
Oranen, who had a long career as a writer, is remembered only for the 44-part series Pure White Canvases, which touched and moved Finland during the depression.
I finally decided to turn the Raikka family business into a clothing business when I read the 50-year-old interview by Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of a tailor, my mother also had a clothing store, and I sometimes model, Oranen recalls.
He believes that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelaini's research and claim revealed that, says Oranen.
Raija Oranen has a very active writing schedule, with many scripts in the works, hundreds of ideas.
The tourists returned across the ravine to the alley of the millionaires.
The wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with the stubborn nomads who managed to cross the moat the town needed and return to the field next to their homes.
The tourists parked their trailer near a street called Millionaire's Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed to block access, bringing with them children, horses, and an army of vans.
The tourists managed to cross a barrier at a point that had been left unprotected by the path.
Angry residents have blamed Solihull Municipality for its "total inability to solve the problem".
A resident who spoke on condition of anonymity said the tourists arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had been throwing rocks at passersby.
The municipality must act because it seems totally incapable of solving the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left, but they came back again.
More of them came tonight and probably more today.
The resident said that Birmingham City Council had resolved the problem by banning access to the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the city can't do anything about it.
Another resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was ridiculous that the tourists returned so soon after they were driven out.
There are more of them than before, and they've even come down to graze a horse in the park.
A Solihull City spokesman said the city is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road and is taking legal action with Solihull Police to remove the campers as soon as possible.
For the purpose of gathering evidence, it is of the utmost importance that as many local people as possible report disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to get a complete picture of the situation for the trial.
Angry people surrounded the Portuguese destroyer
The men who forced their way onto a crowded beach in Portugal were questioned in court today.
Two people died in a crash-landing yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
The maximum sentence for this is 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, a small plane flying by the men was forced to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical failure.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time, some of whom ran from the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl on landing, killing them instantly.
The plane hit the man on the back of the plane first.
Immediately afterward, the plane took off and, when it landed again, hit the child's head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were unharmed.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people approached the plane and began beating its tail, reported Celia Rocha, a witness in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a wonder more people didn't die.
The two men on board were uninjured in the crash.
Finnish star who tragically lost her leg wins another World Cup gold: 'Without the accident I wouldn't be world champion'
Early Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the World Cup gold in the banked slalom at Big White, Canada.
The Great Hammer also won the World Cross Country Championship gold earlier in the competition.
In all, we've won three World Cup titles.
It's a hell of a World Cup!
Two golds, a good pulse, a good draw. The big fish, who was reached by telephone, was happy.
The 30-year-old count thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Big Hammer, the number of challengers in the race is growing all the time.
The whole parachute board has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The gaps are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming.
It seems like every race has a different winner.
Big Hammer lost his other leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been a keen climber since he was young with his friends, and the accident did not diminish his desire to climb.
I mean, I think about it from time to time, what my life would be like if it wasn't for that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless to argue.
The cards are dealt, the big badger points.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Big Hammer does not.
But he turned the terrible hardship to his advantage.
I'd say the situation turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old's greatest hobby of boating was already fading.
The Duun to the summit didn't really start until after the accident.
I used to train with my friends when I was younger, and we used to beat the X-Games all the time.
But they were distant dreams that faded with time.
After the accident, somehow I found myself at the X-Games launch.
I never could have predicted that.
I was 23 years old, and I thought, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and be bitter and mournful".
I decided to quit my job and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well with it.
The county was very pleased that wheelchair racer Leo-Pekka Stjärna was named Athlete of the Year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at a sports gala in January.
Big Hammer says Star's win is a big signal to the para sports community.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the world of para sports.
When is it time to kick off the two-time world champion Matt Big Hammer's athlete of the year campaign?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hammer has not yet conquered all the peaks he covets.
Next year, there's a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that ending the war in Syria and leaving ISIS out of the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The media agency Burson-Marsteller conducted an international survey of the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was conducted between February and March 2017 among 400 Syrian youths aged 18 to 24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
The survey shows that more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Of those who were asked, 42 percent could think of returning to their home country, and 4 percent could not say.
The study found that the most important factors influencing young people's decision to return home are the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor in their permanent return home, while a quarter consider the departure of ISIS to be the most important.
Only less than one tenth of the respondents point to an improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad as the main factors influencing their decision.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
The Syrian youth were asked what is the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority of the population believes that ending the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter of them consider Assad's presidency an obstacle to a peace deal.
Almost half feel that an end to the ongoing conflict in Syria requires both political and military solutions.
Only a fair quarter believe that a conflict can be resolved by military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the power of ISIS declining over the past year, while a fifth feel it has strengthened.
Respondents said that the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many put military measures and education reform as the primary means.
A fair tenth believe that the most important thing is to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under Trump.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the web organized -- a database he developed that is used by people like Wikipedia and Google.
MariaDB, an Espoo-based company, is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
MariaDB, the flagship product of MariaDB, founded by entrepreneurial programmer Michael "Monty" Widenius, is free to users and can be developed online by any proficient programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Databases help to keep vast amounts of information organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they use a MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All the information that is not in image format comes from the database and the images are linked to it", explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the CTO of MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely with his hands is a great help in making sure that the Internet runs smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with David Axmark from Sweden.
In 2008, the tech company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, the software giant Oracle bought Sun for 7.4 billion dollars.
When Oracle was acquired, a lot of the MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't have a firm promise for the future of MySQL", Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company at this point, which started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired 20 of Sun's best developers and made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just needed a name change.
A foundation was set up to oversee the development of MariaDB's code.
"In the days of MySQL, these checks were not made", Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and the MySQL billion-dollar business, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50 percent a year", says Kenneth Paqvalén, chief financial officer at MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet profitable and Paqvalén is short on keywords.
It reveals that MariaDB expects to receive EUR 20 million in orders in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around it services for which corporate customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be a task of more than a year if the client has used a closed database.
MySQL to MariaDB is a quick switch because they're versions of each other.
Amongst others, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is distributed to new users automatically in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our clients include the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks", Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, according to research firm Gartner, players such as MariaDB are still small, albeit fast-growing, players in terms of revenue.
In a database market of about 50 billion dollars, open source databases are not even a billion.
However, the value of open source software cannot be measured in money alone, since most users pay nothing for such software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will already be developing over 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
Moreover, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced by open ones or at least the transition would have begun.
Big companies don't get new customers because most of them choose open source as their next option.
This has led to skyrocketing licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as before with fewer customers,' Widenius thinks.
Since the difficulty of switching from a closed database to a closed database, most of the customer companies have accepted the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers who have a really hard time moving because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database", says Widenius.
He still believes the customer base is coming full.
As the licence fees increase every year, sooner or later the customer will move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% lower and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
In addition, many companies are already facing major systemic changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change their database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest ever EIB growth loan to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector clients in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe spends billions of euros a year on databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently", says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets the way in which money is spent in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to code.
The community helps and does things that they can't invent or do themselves.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most prominent open source promoters, alongside another Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functioning business models on open source.
I still give four or five speeches a year around the world on this subject.
Italy toughened its approach to NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees on board Mediterranean vessels that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules.
If NGOs do not commit to the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities, Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German aid group Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of collaborating with smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges brought by prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosi.
Saving lives is and will always be our top priority.We are very sorry that we are unable to operate in the search and rescue area at this time, the organisation said in a statement posted on social media.
We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the ship of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking refugees on board by boat directly from smugglers who put the boats back into service.
One such incident allegedly took place just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor's document published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which is overseeing the rescue efforts in the area, and is believed to have been motivated by a desire to help.
The operational manual states that vessels such as the Iuventas must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to supervise the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue have so far agreed to follow the policy: Save the Children and Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms,
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the European Union.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
MEPs also called on the Commission to ensure that the EU's nuclear safety programme is implemented in a manner that would ensure that the nuclear safety standards are maintained.
"In recent days, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He said he was prepared to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading for Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected of killing his open-minded partner in a drive-by shooting. Suspect found in the countryside. Case for prosecution.
The alleged crime took place in the Kuttas of Enontekion last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has been reported in the past that both were seasonal workers.
Police also said the suspect ran off with two dogs into the countryside after the attack.
The man was found frozen in the countryside and did not resist arrest.
I need to get charges dropped in less than a week.
The case may be heard in the Lapland District Court as early as August.
Robert Hardy, the star of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also appeared in films and on television.
Hardy is best remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and as a veterinarian in the television series My All-Hairy Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The popular BBC series was filmed over seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for texting her to commit suicide .
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and making phone calls that she believes incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken", Conrad's father said at the hearing on Thursday.
My son was my best friend.
Carter appealed the conviction and was released pending the outcome of the appeal.
He faced up to 20 years in prison, but his lawyers said that both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health issues.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored sweater, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands crossed, his eyes watering as he stared down at the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
She ended Conrad's life to make her own better.
He has not taken responsibility for his actions, the prosecutor continued.
He has shown no remorse.
Carter's lawyer said the case was the result of "shocking circumstances" that Carter deeply regrets.
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's age or maturity level, or even mental health problems, had no significant influence on his actions.
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said that not a day would go by that I would not grieve the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I'm coping with all of this, and I'm trying my best to comfort her sisters in this pain that we're always going to carry.
Conrad's sister Camdy Roy told the court that she was "tormented" by the thought of never seeing her brother's wedding and being an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never goes away", Camdy said.
This case seems to be a precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that criminalizes suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in his car from cage poisoning in 2014.
The case drew national attention when it was revealed that Carter had been texting her boyfriend to encourage him to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", Carter wrote in a series of messages she had sent Roy in the two weeks before his death, when Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just before Roy committed suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad", and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter was trying to get attention for Roy's death, and the judge ruled that Carter was not to profit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts.
Few have defended Carter, including Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion piece by Knox, in which he states: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison".
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The EU's foreign policy has been a major factor in the recent crisis in the Middle East.
Mr Stoltenberg blamed Russia for the incident and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, NATO's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine.
The European Union is also committed to the fight against terrorism.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid a escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was quick to say that relations between the US and Russia had reached dangerously bad levels.
Trump urged the United States to thank Congress for the poor relations between the countries, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi to modify 850,000 diesel engines to deal with setbacks for automakers
The day before Audi announced the deal, BMW offered to update over 350,000 cars' software.
The BMW CEO said the company believes there are "more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make modifications to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
European car manufacturers have been heavily promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the US to meet their CO2 targets.
Diesel engine nitrogen dioxide emissions are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission-neutralizing equipment is increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German carmakers are closely watched, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of complicity with the big car companies and of ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes Volkswagen made by installing cheat devices in their cars that lowered emissions in regulatory tests, but in normal driving they were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi's engine development department, in charge of thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he could be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which authorities suspected had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions standards, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela's election has been the subject of a fraud investigation, with large demonstrations expected
The company claims that the number of registered voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the actual number.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result, National Electoral Commission chairman Tibisay Lucena told reporters.
Maduro assures us the crisis will end
Venezuela voted on Sunday in a controversial vote to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized demonstrations against its change.
The opposition has postponed its own demonstrations to be held at the time of the inauguration.
According to El Pais, the national security forces began taking over the parliament building on Wednesday evening, local time.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the naming ceremony.
Climate change is a threat to the lavender of Provence
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence, in the south of France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Drought and disease-carrying insects have reduced the lavender, and scientists and farmers are desperately trying to find a solution.
The lavender is in danger in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, which has led to a significant decrease in spring and especially autumn rainfall, says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence.
This will shorten the life of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought many small cascades to the area, which spread microbes.
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil is a tourist attraction and a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Instead of tall stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether, says Chaisse.
In other words, the proportion of components containing essential oils is decreasing.
The solution is to improve irrigation, slow the evaporation of soil moisture, spray the plants with a protective mixture of soil and water, and develop more drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist reflects a growing threat in Mexico .
The editors of the once-weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper deals with the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in Sinaloa State.
But today we're discussing safety in light of a recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them to a store that was bombed in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to name each group, no evidence needed, just observations and feelings.
The board lists the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make it dangerous to report on the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is rampant and journalists are increasingly being targeted.The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.The federal government has 589 journalists under its protection who have been attacked and threatened.This year, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and inspiration of Riodec.
The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing his middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and a trademarked Panama hat.
The meeting is being held less than two months after Valdez's death, and the reporters are discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears that have become paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor's Office was created specifically to handle cases involving journalists, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalists' killers rarely face justice, and of the thousands of murders each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, few are brought to justice.
Riodoce's reporters intend to continue reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security conference would be of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is a waste of time, to put it bluntly", he says.
We can't trust anyone until we know why something happened.
Valdez had left the office of Riodoce in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had been driving a few blocks away in his red Toyota when two men stopped him, forced him out of his car, and fired 12 shots, presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce, meaning "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter drove Valdez's car away and crashed it a few miles away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors travel fast and freely in Culiacan.
But the news of Valdez's death is a matter of silence.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
One or more people are shot to death on the streets of Sinaloa every day, and the cemetery has ornate two-story burial buildings of drug lords larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodec's founder and CEO, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that is waging war on Guzman's sons.
The case may have angered Guzman's sons: Suspected gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it hit stores.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career in Norway when, in 2003, he decided to found Riodoce with five colleagues, selling shares of the paper for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem, Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-hitting investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award for his courageous coverage of the Mexican drug trade.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
I want to be able to move on with my life, she said when she received the Committee to Protect Journalists award.
Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
The reporter must accept the task at hand  or play the fool.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when the death was sown here. Why didn't I tell you what was going on?
The staff of Riodoce needs Valdez, a joker who used to swear like a dockworker, a friend who always gave hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted her routines.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the bar across the street from the store, El Guayabo, and he always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if routine was his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about the best way to do their job and stay alive.
The criminals don't like it when we talk about their wives and children and their clean business, their secret drug runways.
They were left out of the case", says Bojorquez.
It meant, at best, a strong sense of self-censorship and self-protection.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you should stay away.
Andres Villarreal, a journalist for Riodec, says that the problem is that "impressions can be deceiving, and that's what happened with Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Cell phones were not allowed in the room where Riodoce was being trained in security, after it was revealed a few days earlier that spyware sold only to governments had been used to spy on activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had taken shelter in a tree in the 40 degree heat.
They had been assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, located in a four-story building in a middle-class area of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-assedly speculated whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent whom the state governor did not trust.
It had been months since the journalists had visited the drug-gang-controlled mountainous countryside.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial team outlined three main stories.
The brother of boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also planned to reveal that government spending had been concentrated in the governor's hometown.
Also, in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, a group of people had been kidnapped.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so the proceedings had to be cautious: everyone in the town knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered to a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Governors who belong to it have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases recently.
Villarreal asked the reporter to report on previous incidents in the same area, one of which involved the escape of Guzman's son, El Chapo, from an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would get reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
We would have known what had happened earlier, says Villarreal, 46, who has been nicknamed El Flaco, the Thin One, because of his slim build.
Now all communications with our sources of information are cut.
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the persecution of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took some signs with her the next morning to a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office, which was again prompted by the murder of a reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which, according to DNA tests, the authorities have made, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly across the country, with signs of SOS Press appearing on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he's trying to rally international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that his anger will not allow him to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organized crime, authorities that tolerate crime and an indifferent society.
In his final book, Drug Journalism, Valdez writes that while drug gangs kill journalists, they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in league with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the work of the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing", Ramirez says.
Murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Next to his body was a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writing".
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, like El Manana in Nuevo Laredo, even though its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the drug cartels on its front page: What do you want from us?
Some of the reporters have fled their states or the country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on your guard at all times.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four other women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra , who was going to be a poet , admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is going to hell", he says.
Some time ago, on a Friday at midnight, Riodec reporters were sitting outside the newsroom drinking beer on the sidewalk as the latest issue of the magazine was being finished.
In a shootout between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort, 19 people were killed.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters posted the story on the Riodoce website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
I had to re-write the front page the next day.
Sirens were hooting nearby. Another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it up very well.
Riodoce's edition continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the newspaper under this massive portrait of a man pointing his middle finger at the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider closing down. How can I close down the paper when our intern asked to go out on the street to do a story the day after Javier was murdered?
The Hannu Mannisen Olympic project started with a huge setback.
In April, the celebration of Hannu Mannis' 39th birthday was cut short as the professional pilot began preparations for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began disastrously when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
This began a long illness that lasted nearly five weeks.
I spent virtually all of May sick.
First, I had the flu, and then a childhood illness, such as ear infection, for which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do ten percent of the exercises I had planned.
I can't remember the last time I was sick for that long.
It was a hard place when I didn't get to use the practice space, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
The test result collapsed .
The 2007 World Champion did not receive his training permit until the second week of June, as evidenced by the non-rolling test of the KIHU, the Centre for Research on Competition and Sport, on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skies on roller skates on a carpet that is increased in speed every three minutes.
After each three-minute period, the carpet is stopped for about ten seconds and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall, I was on the rug for 32 minutes, but now I'm only 28 minutes.
Mannix says it was a fire in the wall.
In a better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he's remained healthy.
I have been doing a variety of relaxing aerobic exercises to try to normalize my metabolism.
We're in the middle of a really good five-week period.
And John also took a week and a half off from the plane crash.
I also got to go to the cabin with my family.
Last season, Manninen only competed in four World Cups before the Lahti World Cup home games.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race, when Manninen climbed to 18th in the top-level skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until February.
We're going to try to get a different rhythm to practice than we did last season.
After the first snowball games, Ruka would have three World Cup weekends.
In December, the plan is to be in at least one World Cup weekend, maybe in Ramsau.
By the end of January, the plan is to be in Seefeld again.
Hopefully, after that, he'll be on the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manning's sixth Winter Olympics in his career.
Now, the main thing is to stay healthy, says the Nume who celebrated gold in the 2002 team competition in Salt Lake City.
The dinosaur protected itself from its enemies by masquerading as a man .
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first results of a Canadian miner's discovery of a creature the size of a rhinoceros, so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that researchers could even determine that its fine skin was reddish-brown and that it had a troubled past.
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best of its kind in the world.
A recent fossil is a nodosaur that lived in the mid-Middle Eocene, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this remarkably well-preserved fossil a truly significant find.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He came across something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to investigate his find further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Palaeontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was dug up over a six-year period from a 1,100-pound block.
The results of your hard work are now being seen.
"If you squint, you can almost believe it was asleep", says science writer Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies revealed that the carnivorous dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this herbivore, even though it wore armor and resembled a walking armored carriage.
Its red and white armor shielded it from predators, and it was also protected by the darker top and lighter bottom coloration still found in many animals.
Experts say that this gave it a better chance to blend in and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
A 110-million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Palaeontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealopella markmitchelli after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours excavating the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has been preserved so remarkably well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body tendons and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal kingdom by a common coloration, with the body darker above and lighter below.
Still, the discovery was surprising, since the Borealope is considerably larger than modern animals with similar coloration.
It suggests that the carnivorous dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding over fighting as a means of survival.
Modern animals like deer, zebras, and armadillos have similar coloration, are much smaller, and therefore easier prey, suggesting that nodosaurs were also critically endangered.
"The large, heavily armored dinosaur hunt shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were", says Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the Nodosaurus' gills reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the nodosaur to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate for its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and was swept into the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was as warm as Florida is today, and rivers and seas likely extended farther than today.
This nodosaur is really remarkable because its smooth skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved in three dimensions in its original form, Brown says.
That's why it looks almost the same as in the early leap year.
It takes little imagination to visualize it: a twinkle in the eye almost makes you believe it was asleep.
The Cretaceous was the age of theropods, giant bipedal, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before the Boreal, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
For example, the ancestors of Tyrannosaurus rex included Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 36 feet [11.5 m] long.
The latest findings from a team of Nodosaurus researchers, published in Current Biology, suggest that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
The museum says it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with its skin and armor from the torso to the hips.
Nodosaurs averaged 15 feet [5 m] in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds [1,300 kg].
Two spikes, half a centimeter long, rose from their scaffolding.
Researchers believe that this armored herbivore traveled through what is now western Canada until a flooded river washed it out to sea.
Its armor has survived in detail in an underwater tomb.
Its fossilised remains are so well preserved that its skin still remains in the hollow plates of armor along its skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, such preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The fossilized skin on the hollow plates of its skull remains.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the tendons in the sole of that foot.
How did one activist learn to answer the question, Whose streets are these?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on his bed in his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a note from a high school friend:
Police just killed an 18-year-old man, and his body is still on the street.
He was confused, and he noticed that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from user @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted live about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man shot by white police in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone down, and when he went back to Twitter later that night, they said people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police shutters and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell watched a real-time video of a police officer standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video of another policeman pointing his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals".
"This is not normal", Ferrell recalls saying.
It was not the kind of murder we're used to, which could be called typical.
And then I felt the cold colors.
I was angry and I cried.
He booked a flight home the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 p.m. and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
The events that occurred to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years have been the subject of a documentary film, Whose Streets?
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, and strength and resilience from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with his daughter in a floral dress and a matching crown, they resumed a discussion about "what it's like to live as a black man and what conditions" they had discussed countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you about how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me", Ferrell later recalled.
Today's events are the culmination of events from the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow up with it.
He needs to be able to be activist and organize, but he also needs to know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living as a black person, and he needs to know what we have to do to be free, to be free.
And while I'm lucky I was able to protect her from the blatant racism, she's still just like any other black girl.
I feel like I'd hurt her if I protected her from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, across the street from the police station, which became a campsite for activists waiting for information on the case and finally learning that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local businessman who was making lunch packages.
They packed lunch in bags and handed them out to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9", she says. "When I was a student at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Minority Nursing Students Association, and she focused on food rights and health inequalities in black communities.
I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.
Weeks later, at a nightly demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind was filled with doubt, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times that people, usually white, had come to the local community, just to take advantage of its hardships and perseverance.
We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice, Folayan said in a recent interview. We wanted to do things differently
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism on death row.
Davis's involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other local filmmakers to document the events of the years following Brown's shooting.
This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak, says Davis.
For me, the most important thing was how the local people were portrayed in the film, because I am portrayed in the same way.
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, as they wanted to show that the popular movement is not about a charismatic leader but about a community.
That's why the documentary reveals surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked", Ferrell laughs as he tells us what it was like to see the film for the first time.
But I understood that this job and the humane portrayal of black people required a certain vulnerability.
And Ferrell's story is also re-enacting and re-focusing the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media after the shooting of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, by police in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
Black queer women's leadership has kept the whole movement going, says Ferrell. It's because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to put up with everything.
Folayan agrees: The movement is really being driven by black women, many of whom are queer.
However, she stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary on purpose because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy going", says Folayan.
But it's no coincidence that she was on the front lines, because black queer women are at the cutting edge of a lot of things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen.
The news crew left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years of probation left on his sentence for blocking a highway during a protest.
His description of the socio-political atmosphere in his home town is brief and concise: Sakasotku.
Yet he still believes in the slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
All we can do is lose our chains.
A perfect match: an artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has a face hanging in the center of the exhibition space  white, black, and brown faces, which, when viewed closely, are similar.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent the samples to Fort Leavenworth, where he was serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama on his third and final day in office.
Dewey-Hagborg algorithmically analysed Manning's DNA and created 30 portraits from his genetic data, a sharp, though somewhat theoretical, approach to the modifiability of DNA data, the multiplicity and causality of interpretations, and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified with women since her teenage years, and was convicted in 2013 of 20 felonies, including violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one photo of Manning in prison: a grainy, black and white selfie of Manning, in a car in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-blue wig that became his trademark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a highly acclaimed Stranger Visions project in 2015 that she completed in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, obtained DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gum, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a photo for their story, Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference about the new exhibition.
Manning was not allowed to visit him and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in doing a DNA profile on Manning.
The artist and his captive muse suddenly became correspondents, and they corresponded for a couple of years.
They even collaborated on a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted a future where the president commuted Chelsea's sentence and she could see the exhibit.
In fact, Obama commuted Manning's sentence just days after the comic book was published, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in a national military prison.
It's also impressive that the exhibit opens at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against leakers and transgender soldiers and is constantly inventing new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divides he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that everything has a purpose.
The artist's statement on the gallery wall, under which Manning's large signature with the heart as the end of the first letter of his last name, demands an end to the automatic division based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence, written in pencil in a long line of C, G and A.
This 200-letter , or nucleotide, as the artist uses the scientific definition of , is a Dewey-Hagborg combination that he wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least biologically.
I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are all equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation, says Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells countless stories, and here are 30 of them.
The final work in the exhibition is in his own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
It's Manning's character rising from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can silence you, they've won", says the picture.
Don't ever shut up.
The text is from a letter I received from Manning, says the Philadelphia artist.
It's so impressive that I still get cold colors.
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibit, and when Manning arrives, he is greeted by faces based on his own genetic information, like a bunch of protesters in the middle of the exhibit space.
It is intentional, as is everything else in this exhibition: Manning's DNA sequence, for example, is written in lead pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd, says Dewey-Hagborg.
I wanted to capture the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release.
A professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University are wanted on suspicion of murder .
Police say they've launched a nationwide manhunt for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago apartment.
Cook County court records show that warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, on suspicion of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleu, both of whom were charged with first-degree murder without the possibility of parole.
According to the files, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local news release from the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple gunshot wounds to the body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an emailed statement, Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public affairs at the university, said Lathem is now on administrative leave and is barred from the Northwestern campus.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation", Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior assistant in financial management at Oxford University.
An email from a spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said: "We have been in contact with police in the UK and stand ready to assist the US authorities investigating the case in any way we can".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Chicago Police Department press director Anthony Guglielmi said he urges suspects to surrender themselves to authorities.
Police have a sense of their whereabouts, and we are constantly tightening our search, said Guglielmi.
Google says local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
He told police that they had received a call from the landlord of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as appalling.
According to Guglielmi, it's unclear if the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras showed Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair", says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to residents: Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.
A man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", the convict told the police.
Moffatt will be sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of one count of aggravated assault.
According to police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims".
The suspect left the store after receiving threats.
Moffatt was caught making a phone call to the police about a threat.
The threat was not related to the bookstore.
Authorities found Moffatt wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incident, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police during interrogations.
As punishment, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay £620 (about $480) in legal fees and £85 (about $95) in compensation to the victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said a number of hate crimes go unreported.
We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Some of the roadmap measures have already been implemented and RUSADA has been granted the right to design and test in cooperation with UK Anti-Doping Agency UKAD.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers.
Mutko says there's nothing to worry about in the Russian Federation.
Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, Mutko added.
However, one of the points of the roadmap requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer, commissioned by WADA, which is investigating alleged state involvement in Russian doping in sport.
Butko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes and we cannot grant something that did not exist.
Mutko's words echoed a statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the independent public anti-doping commission of Russia.
Earlier in the day, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport, Smirnov admitted that there had been problems with the Russian anti-doping body.
He also stressed that the EU was not going to accept the report unconditionally.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, it was authorised to design and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD last June.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July and stated that the organisation was "on the right track" towards restoring its powers.
British organisation sceptical about Finnish innovation: 'no evidence' of health benefits of maternity packs
A British organisation has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The Lullaby Trust, an organization that fights concealed deaths, is banning its own pamphlets from being used in maternity kits distributed in Britain, reports the BBC and the Guardian.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there's no evidence that a maternity kit reduces the risk of stillbirth.
A sudden death is an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK's health authority's expert on safe sleep for children.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be wrapped in them, as that would imply that we recommend the product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good numbers are the result of many different factors, including the low rate of teenage pregnancy.
The fact that each family is given a box there may be one factor.
But that's not for sure, said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity kits are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and underlying deaths.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package contains various items, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish Government claims that the boxes they distribute meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the Lullaby Trust, a sleeping bag may be the best option for sleeping if a cot or bunk is not available.
The organisation recommends that the pack is used for nap time only and discontinued when the child is able to turn over.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that it is not wet or dirty.
A vicious thug escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time.
The staff of the Japanese zoo is searching for an escaped turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the crew with its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
A turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras showed the bad guy leaving the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, said Yoshimi Yamane, a zoo worker.
The fugitive is a 35-year-old female, weighing 180 pounds, about three feet.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the daytime, the bad guy is allowed to roam freely in the garden.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of the turtle.
The last time the bad guys escaped was the other week.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes.
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious.
The surveys were simply not consistent and objective, says Errett.As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online shopping.
Errett decided to turn to outside help.
There are more and more new types of HR start-ups that are coming onto the market to help other companies figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and demographics, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct communication through senior management to the board.
You can track your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for businesses? asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint, a Redwood City startup that provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years and says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme allows quick surveys and polls of specific teams, and a map that shows at a glance which departments are most dissatisfied with employees and which managers have the lowest ratings, which has allowed Errett to get to the heart of the problems.
Companies have realized that they need to follow workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, and the hype around the ride-hailing company has been building ever since a former employee wrote on her blog about a culture where employees are harassed and punished for talking about their problems.
For startups like Glint, this kind of negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry that, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based Convercent, a startup that helps companies detect and prevent misconduct, gained traction earlier this year when Uber's reputation crashed.
Convergent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently made a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to create customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time and map out problem areas.
In addition, employees can report misconduct anonymously via text message.
And if there is reason to suspect impropriety on the part of the manager, complaints go directly to the company board.
Public opinion has replaced the authorities, says Patrick Quinlan, Founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which has over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that its employees are aware of its policies and procedures and have easy access to its headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out a phone number or e-mail address to report it to headquarters, then make a formal complaint and hope it is taken seriously.
It was often a scary and unpleasant experience, says James Vitrano, legal counsel at Ruby Tuesday.
Previously, problems that were hidden from managers working in another city or state, such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages, can now be detected and addressed more quickly.
I get a more holistic and comprehensive view of the worker's reality, says Vitrano, who heads the risk management group at Ruby Tuesday.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment litigation.
Quinlan said that companies took ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously after the failure of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical practices in the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies realized they could no longer prevent their laundry from being publicly cleaned up.
Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to ethics control, says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, which is charged on a regular basis.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's been embraced by venture capitalists, and both Glinth and Convercent have venture capitalists behind them.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received a €10 million funding round from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market like the Valley of the Hidden, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are giving of their time to a truly beneficial enterprise.
Employees are more committed to the success of a company if they enjoy being at the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding, says Nina McQueen, head of employee compensation and wellbeing at LinkedIn.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, and companies succeed when employees are committed.
Third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement, so it's no wonder they're attracting investors.
Workplace culture experts say that knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if it is not taken into account.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough or nothing changes, frustration can reduce employee engagement.
If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 discussions, says Russell Raath, CEO of management consultancy Kotter International, who has found companies relying too much on data collection alone.
If the company does not take action, workers start to wonder whether they have been heard
And whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?
Errett said Madison Reed now conducts interviews with staff every month and can address the problem the same day it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated with the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday has a better understanding of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve long-term staffing in an industry known for its high turnover.
If a company does not commit to a culture of transparency, it will lose employees, says Vitrano.
If it loses employees, it loses customers.
And without customers, there's no business.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of wiretapping his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from a shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a string outside her window.
The woman said the cell phone camera caught the apartment.
The woman, who was frightened by the incident, had run to the other room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check on the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but was soon afterwards lowered back into the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of wiretapping has admitted to filming a woman.
But he claimed he only photographed the woman's face.
The video that was taken on the cell phone had been deleted and the police had not been able to return it as evidence.
In the course of the interrogation, the man has admitted to the crime, but has denied any involvement.
The man described had justified his love for his neighbor by saying that he was "crazy".
According to the TT news agency, the man is being charged in the case.
Teachers are demanding more bribes at the fall negotiations.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of jobs in the EU, which will be increased by the EU's own resources.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are eligible for EU funding.
We cannot conclude agreements which do not involve some sort of holiday cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts are not concluded until the private sector has signed the papers and the rates of increase are known.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, the working conditions of OAJ will be agreed in January.
The percentage targets were not yet disclosed by the Locksmith.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the Juko, a public sector training organisation.
Luukkainen: Cuts in holiday pay increase income inequality
According to the OJC, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees will decrease while the purchasing power of the private sector will increase.
According to Luukkainen, the periodic cut in holiday pay will further exacerbate the disparities in earnings.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be defined
The OAJ also points out that equality in primary education must be ensured, as the gap between the best and worst performers is constantly widening.
The organization says that learning outcomes are declining and that the gaps between students and regions are growing.
The Bruins' day got longer when the NCAA cut their daily practice from two to one.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. and a group of UCLA football players are stuck chatting on the other side of the new practice fields on campus.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, their backs glistening with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a lunch break.
The players, who are in the summer school at the university, after three hours of practice, return to the dormitory to study for their final exams, and the next morning they gather at 7:30 at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough on these guys", says Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday's move to Tuesday.
The university's governing body, the University Athletic Association, reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one, a change intended to lighten the workload of the players but which has extended their days  at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That's why UCLA's first three practice sessions started at a quarter past seven at night, and the players' already full schedules made it difficult to find space.
The restriction of practice to one day means more practice days than ever before, and this year's camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six seasons as Westwood coach that practice will coincide with summer classes.
The practice is scheduled for 18 games before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the season opener begins: UCLA versus Texas A&M in September.
Mora says he supported changing the NCAA rules even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
We put a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging, says Mora.
But the players are willing to work, and they're great friends.
I think things will get easier when we get to Saturday, when we have more time.
UCLA is closing its practice outside of camp after the game, which is not easy given the direct view from the practice field to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that's already been bombarded with footballs that have flown over the net behind the goal post.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements", says Mora.
The concern is that people can book a room and videotape the exercises from there.
You know, they pay a lot for a video of a drill.
But we have security there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan.
Freedom for Rwanda
The central African country of Rwanda is holding presidential elections on Friday, the winner of which is already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for a third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
It was then that the RPF stopped the genocide being carried out by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Mr Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of, for example, falsifying poverty statistics.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term as the constitution, which limited the president to two terms, was amended.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely liked leader.
Under his leadership, Rwanda has seen social reforms and an influx of international investment.
And Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country torn apart by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to question whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagamek has promised his people more freedom once the country is back on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by making fact checking more effective
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to independent fact-checkers more often and to post the results under the original article, the world's largest social network announced Thursday.
The company posted a statement on its website saying it would start using updated machine learning to identify fake news, and that any fake news would be sent to fact-checkers and the results could be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the biggest distributor of fake news, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has sparked political debate in Europe, where French voters have been bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September election, is backing a plan to ban social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that fact-checking is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
People want to see which stories don't pass independent reviewers, and they also want more background information to help them make more informed decisions about what they read and share, Sara Su, product manager at Facebook News Feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the "Theme-related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of the Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottney Castle in Kent is now best known for the music video for Squeeze and as the hiding place of Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
Now, in a picturesque location in the Bewley River valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who loves old documents.
I'm thrilled to be able to study a text written by a man who died over 300 years ago, says Rhodes eagerly.
I feel a personal connection when I hold this letter in my hand.
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of Scotney families from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each depicted by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library.
"I was moved to tears when I saw the thumbprint in the letter, which had been written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century", says Rhodes.
It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke because fire was used for lighting back then.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel as if he were in the place himself.
I love the archives!
The writer, fascinated by ancient documents, was granted a nearly four-month stay in the castle with the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
She spent her days exploring the Victorian castle, its archives, treasures and rarities, such as the heads of hyenas hanging on the walls and bottles that had been in the trenches for centuries.
He toured the ruins and grounds of the old castle, conversing with rangers, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who illustrated the book.
In the evening, he drank whiskey and started writing.
The castle's history is relatively unknown, as it was not given to the National Trust until the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation staff were just beginning to go through the archives, and Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the excess to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You'd think that the landlords would be boring", says Rhodes. "But here families were fighting over one hill.
I thought, "Why don't we just let it go?"
Some of the stories in the book progress from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, which tells the story of a man who is involved in the Peasants' Revolt of England in 1381, shortly after the castle was completed.
The book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions a riot in the castle in 1380, Rhodes says.
The English peasant revolt started in the same area, and it occurred to me that the revolt could start with rioting.
Perhaps these events are connected?
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle  such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland, and the men in the family seem to have been quite the thugs, constantly getting into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to soften the heiress.
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Life Mountain, a health resort in the early 20th century that now only has a lush plot of land.
Castle Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave", she says.
I never wanted to go back to this damn day.
Relations with Russia are the worst since the Cold War .
The EU's foreign policy has been a major factor in the recent crisis in the Middle East.
Mr Stoltenberg blamed Russia for the incident and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, NATO's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine.
The European Union is also committed to the fight against terrorism.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid a escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was quick to say that relations between the US and Russia had reached dangerously bad levels.
Trump urged the United States to thank Congress for the poor relations between the countries, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko is out . The rematch against Anthony Joshua is off .
Longtime heavyweight boxing world champion Vladimir Klitschko is ending his career.
Klitschko, 41, of Ukraine, announced his decision Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 fights.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost his last two fights.
He was beaten by Tyson Fury in November of 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match with a stun in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to face off in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitschko found no motivation to fight.
"I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley game", Klitschko said in a statement.
I achieved everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start a second career after sports.
I never imagined I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
Watch Klitschko's explanation for his decision on video.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitschko.
But he has always insisted that he would quit if he was no longer motivated enough.
The Commission is therefore making a clear decision to do so, he said.
Klitschko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers held the World Cup titles in different confederations simultaneously.
The Finnish weatherman witches the conditions: "Get out of the way"
The pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has been suffering from the conditions during the summer outdoor season.
Minna Nikkas has been having some problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her from her flipper.
The London World Cup is also a volatile environment.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against pole vaulter Minna Nikkas.
"I don't want to blame the track, but it was unbelievable that I couldn't get even the little clubs to move properly", Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I have competed and trained here God knows how many times and I have never experienced such a change of wind in this place", Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
"It has been really difficult to stabilize the jump this season, with such unstable winds even in practice", Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was good in London on Thursday.
It's been a challenge to get the technology together, whether it's freezing or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been really hard.
It's no use using energy under bad conditions.
He's got a 455 to qualify for the World Championships.
There's been 445 out.
London is not the same for everyone.
You just have to be patient and wait for the better winds.
The goal is to cross 460 on Friday.
Why don't you go overseas and train?
- That's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany for my freshman year.
I got the jump together and the technology stabilized.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
The normal guy's been in the gym practicing, now the gym's closed.
What would be the ideal race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little wind is fine, as long as it's consistent.
A veteran ex-government official scolded politicians at Yale: "We have nothing to share now or for many years".
Despite the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep its cool and be careful about inflating the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has spent decades preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's nothing to distribute.
Yle interviewed the retired Virtas in 2015 on Wednesday in Ykkösaam.
The state's next year's budget is just beginning to be prepared.
Recently, political proposals have been put forward, including a guarantee pension, a car tax and support for electric bicycles.
They are basically telling us that elections are coming up, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have nothing to allocate now, and for many years to come.
"I think it's even treason to talk about theft when you're taking out a loan", Virtanen told Ylee.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt is owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience of preparing state budgets, starting in 1978 as budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and subsequently as deputy head of the budget department and head of the budget.
He was last employed as a clerk in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment before retiring.
Virtanen noted in an interview with Yle that the 3% economic growth now projected is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is the peak from which we will start to go down in the next year, and Finland will have to wait decades for a 1% growth.
Washington is changing the rules on permanent residency .
President Donald Trump announced that the rules of permanent residence, or Green Card, will be changed in a new immigration plan, according to media reports.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, toughen the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans, and the president is backing them.
The bill is scheduled to be debated in both houses of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to foreign nationals.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy", Trump was quoted as saying by the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not wish to be buried with the Queen .
Prince Henry does not wish to be buried with Queen Marguerite.
This is Prince Henry and Queen Marguerite, taken in April.
Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, the Danish court says.
Traditionally, the royal couple in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal Household has announced today that Prince Henry does not wish to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to the British newspaper, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, commented Lene Belleby, the court's communications director, in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal to his spouse.
The court said the Queen has long been aware of her husband's desire for a burial site and understands the decision.
A moment of terror on the road, the car almost hit the highway.
Tom had a husband and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they won't get insurance money if the other party isn't reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archival photo from the Ring III construction site.
Tommi from Vantala says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his open-minded wife Riina and the couple's two young children were driving on the motorway at Keimolanport in the Vantaa area in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
At the junction of Ring III and Hämeenlinnanväylen, a white car was driving along the accelerator lane, which was about to drive into the side of the family car, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the dodge, Tom would have been hit by the car.
I brake and turn the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at high speed.
The parents and two young children in the back seat were uninjured.
One of the children is a little under three years old, the other under one year old.
Apparently, it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one even drove in on us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened at approximately 5:20 p.m.
Tom said that no one stopped to see them and the family called the emergency room.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived and checked on the family.
The car went into recovery.
Tommi says that he and his partner have a small income, and they received a family grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information on the other car, Tom says the family won't get the insurance money.
So the family is hoping for eyewitness reports of the car that caused the family to hit the road.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to kindergarten and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tom saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thinks the number on the license plate of the car was SIG.
If we don't catch whoever did this, I don't know how we're gonna make it financially, and we're still gonna have to count every penny.
Tom is hoping that anyone who saw or knows anything about what happened will contact the police.
Eastern Uusimaa police and Central Uusimaa rescue service confirmed that they were on duty at the accident site on Tuesday evening.
Corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what the story originally said, Tom says the second car did not enter the opposing lane, but was driven from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
The play, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, is about human relationships through the medium of humor.
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola is bringing her first directorial debut to the What? Theater.
The Revealer is a musical about broken relationships and inadequacy.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says it still makes you feel good.
The subject is treated with humor.
He says, "Don't let the sadness get to you".
The touring summer theatre show has been realized with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the show challenges us to consider what a person reveals about himself when he meets a new person.
Is he pulling some kind of a stunt or is he approaching another coat?
A play without a plot is a mixture of fact and fiction .
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the play.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the play draws on the ideas of young people, it appeals to all ages.
The report also stresses that the Commission's proposal to establish a European Data Protection Supervisor is not a good idea.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own world of values will care about the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I also don't think relationships, especially couples, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their parents' divorce
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Revealer paints a contemporary picture of young adults living in Finland in the century.
She says that many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least, it means listening to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show stars Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The task force also includes Ella Snellman, a costume designer.
The music is by Jäppinen and Roka.
I fell in love with the theater in Kouvola .
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Arts.
Two years behind and another mop up ahead.
Jappine's passion for theater began during the Kouvolan years.
The music teacher has been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the University Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the City Theatre in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in directing.
The revelator premiered last week in Helsinki at the Fool's Theatre.
The 45-minute show will be seen in the future at least in Jäppinen's study town of Turku.
The self-revealer at the Kouvola What? Theater on August 4th at 7:00 and August 5th at 2:00 and 7:00.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year after a horrific motocross accident - broken collarbone
Few athletes in Finland are as unstoppable a force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of spades traveled the world hundreds of days a year for 20 years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also a test-taker of new disciplines.
I don't think there are many forms of exercise on earth that the alchemist hasn't tried at least once.
It's been inspiring me to practice.
There's always something new to discover, Lahtela says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop the Bay entirely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, he broke his collarbone and both arms.
I wasn't working anywhere.
Lahtela says I licked wounds in my home for a year.
I had bad luck at the Bay.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the disaster.
Riding a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't ask for boundaries.
It's just a sport so intense, a 40-year-old like me shouldn't be too keen on it!
After the accident, Lahtela found himself in a very special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
After a long and difficult career as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the sport immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during training, Lahtela often challenged his protege on the slope and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, the stop was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts seemed unreasonable.
Not even in the sport.
It was good to be back.
I actually enjoy it because for once, I really got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become head coach of Finland.
If he didn't stop, he's afraid he'd burn out.
It's easier to find parts of a body that's been broken than parts that are intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I never would have realized I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed skating.
I traded my motocross for Frisbee golf!
It was like a flash in the pan.
At my worst, I was throwing for seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not demand that his trainees be like him.
I don't make everyone the same.
In our species culture, there's room to be yourself and ways to be the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
The sex robots are coming and we have reason to be concerned .
It's here: a report on the technological development of sex robots  just when it seemed that 2017 could not get any weirder.
Yes, you are.
Sex robots are big business now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
We need to start taking the spread of sex robots seriously, says Noel Sharkey, founder of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of fingernails.
Sex robots are being touted, but they are already selling quite a lot and we will see more of them, Sharkey said at the launch of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and artificial intelligence-designed features that mimic human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences, from eye color to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
Even more worrying is that the robots have a "personality" that makes the Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, such as shyness.
The Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
The personality of Roxxy Gold is as fully as possible adapted to the user's personality, the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It may be tired, in a chatter mood or in a mood.
There are many worrying features of the prevalence of sex robots, which are replacing real human relationships, but even more dangerous are the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, where the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be shy and resistant.
True Companion's website compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator:
Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is a sign of something darker and deeper in our culture: a retreat from gender equality to gendered intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not buy sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, even though the FRR report said they are growing in popularity.
But the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of the times.
And many people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have become commonplace at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and the White House has a president who has boasted of harassing women.
The most disturbing aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not its strong imagery, such as images of hanged bodies and gouged out eyes, but how realistic the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems surprisingly close.
The aim is to make sex robots as much like real women (on the scale of porn stars) as technically possible.
The designers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as closely as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will of their own, no history, nothing to suggest independence or to break the fantasy of total submission.
They're very pleasant servants.
The slave.
Police suspect two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, led by an ISIS leader.
The head of the Islamic State extremist group led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to deliver a bomb to an Etihad Airways flight.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior ISIS figure had also sent parts for the bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be carried on the plane on July 15, but the attempt was aborted before the security check.
The police won't say why the attempt was aborted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to separate toxic colorless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transportation system.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plot was one of the most professional ever devised in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday in connection with suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but he too is being questioned.
The good things about Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a man of common sense .
The Trump era has already been repeated to the point of exhaustion that the sharp divide in the voting power has also broken up families on a daily basis.
Between Christmas and Thanksgiving, columns of advice in American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information bubbles to burst.
What's been less well-regarded is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing spiritual poet from Chicago who's been in a long-standing feud with our family of Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, everyone I know of my cousin, including the pro-Republican sister with whom he's been arguing politics for decades, is suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the dinner table, but in the wider context, it carries significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new lease on life, but the distorting effect of his presidency may actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we're talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to stand up to his tricks.
In the long run, there's an even more frightening possibility that Trump will normalize far-right Republicans, who suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember with a sigh Mitt Romney's tempered version of madness: dog on the roof of a car, 14 percent income tax (and his tax returns, at least we've seen them), all seem like very minor infractions compared to Trump.
When the Trump era is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be sane, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, which is the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel's horses are huge, the central figures  the mocking clowns and the terrified animals looking behind  are ominous, and the squealing music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York's landmarks become disappointing: the views of the towers become boring, the city silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city becomes unrealistic.
And I still haven't quite got over the fact that, after 35 years, the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a major traffic circle in North London.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, remains a strange and magical experience  to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my rating, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card into the reader.
It's the same thing at the coffee shop on my corner, but they also give me the option to add a 15 percent service charge to the estimate when I go to the counter and get my own coffee.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer service representative to put his or her personality on the line when it is not needed.
The store clerk smiled with a sorry face as I fatiguedly gave my credit card a five-star rating.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter because of lack of trust from the management
FC Inter today relieved Shefki Kuq of his duties as head coach of the club's national team.
The new head coach will be Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously assistant coach.
The remaining training team shall continue in their current duties.
The Italian has previously been an assistant coach at Sunderland, among others.
Piccareta, 51, joined Inter in January and has completed his UEFA Pro Licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of the board of directors of Inter, expresses his deepest regrets.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented in a club press release.
Piccaretta's contract is up until the end of the season.
He's in charge, along with the rest of the coaching staff, for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to the Evening News, the team has been in a bit of a tailspin on Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the team's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved to the sidelines.
Kuqi and Piccareta were heavily matched in Inter's game against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a childhood photo from the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a picture of herself as a teenager on Instagram.
Several stigmas have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Even Lampenius wonders about a serious young woman staring at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he was sending a message.
If you can't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Lampenius has previously published photos of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a couple of pictures of himself on Instagram.
One picture shows her 20 years ago, and the other shows her now, as a mother of two.
In his illustrations, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human and refers to eating disorders he suffered as a young man.
Exactly 20 years ago today...
"I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look", Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added the hashtags in English: life, eating disorder, insecurity, self-esteem, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
By the time she was 14, she was in the hospital with anorexia and orthorexia.
Soon afterward, she also developed bulimia, which was not finally revealed until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius found a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed from prison to the hospital with chest pains .
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts to his wrists, which prison officials say he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing multiple rounds through the toilet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the bathroom.
Prosecutors have said they plan to appeal, saying Pistorius' six-year sentence is too lenient.
The State Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarian citizens illegally camped in Greece have been arrested, the country's foreign ministry reported on bTV.
Police arrested a group of people camping without permission in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
According to the Bulgarian television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that the Bulgarians had been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping sites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone camping outside the designated areas.
The inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry of Justice has informed us that the court may impose a fine.
The liquidity is sinking. It's already down 7.7%.
The share of oil refiner Neste has fallen 7.7% since 11 a.m.
Its pre-tax profit fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has opened today on the slightly frozen side in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock markets opened, the European broad Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general OMXH index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover on the stock exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million was the morning's earnings announcer, Nested.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like digestive nightmares.
However, recent research suggests otherwise - a diet rich in meat protein and dairy may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic condition that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although people with irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is found in protein, helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal lining.
According to Marco Colonna, the study's leader, immune cells guard the salt and prevent harmful microbes from entering the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen the immune system, which protects the body without damaging delicate tissue.
If the balance drops too close to the inflammation, the result can be irritable bowel syndrome.
The tests showed that resistance-boosting immune cells are present in mice that have a particular bacterium in their gut.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to start producing immune cells, which is one of the building blocks of proteins.
We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of resistance-promoting cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome, says Professor Colonna.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells.
If the same is true in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan may improve intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
In studying resistance-boosting immune cells, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, the mice of the same species kept separate from the other group did not.
He suspected that the difference was due to the microbiome of the mice's gut, the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the gut DNA of the mice was examined, six types of bacteria were found in the mice that had immune cells but not in the other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice raised in a sterile environment, which had no gut microbiome and had not developed immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
To find out how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of the liquid  without bacteria  from mice to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into endurance-boosting cells.
When the active substance was purified from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indoli-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of resistance-boosting cells increased by about 50 percent.
Cervantes-Barragan says that humans have the same immune-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan byproducts cause cells from Lactobacillus reuteri to develop in humans in the same way as in mice, but genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
We probably want to promote the development of these cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines, says Cervantes-Barragan.
High tryptophan levels in combination with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their prevalence.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have gotten him into their ranks after signing Nemanja Matic .
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed Neymar after the midfielder made his debut for Manchester United against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40m, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's penultimate game before Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup tie against Real Madrid, impressing as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in his best form yet, as he was not on the Asian tour of the blue jerseys before the start of the season, and he only managed 45 minutes on the pitch - a change that Mourinho said would be necessary before the start of the season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius. He has a natural football mindset", Mourinho says.
We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later.
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were about to start the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to trim his starting lineup for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "brilliant job" of acquiring three of his four priority players.
Three out of four  have to be thanked for this, he added.
I'd be more satisfied if I had all four, but they did a great job.
The volleyball girls teased the Germans for two rounds .
The Finnish women's national volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualification tournament to Germany straight away 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German gambling routine is high.
"Their game was evenly matched in every sector", said Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponent under tight control, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we played with patience and aggressively enough in certain places, we could play along, Kangasniemi said.
Finland's best finish was 14 points by Piia Korhonen.
Finland, which has lost three of its last four games, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
A grand jury has already issued subpoenas in connection with Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia.
In the United States, a grand jury has issued subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already issued subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections.
The news agency Reuters reports that the case confirms a report by the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about the grand jury.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has issued subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-linked Veselnitskaya, which was held in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also in attendance were Donald Trump Sr.'s then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
Reuters sources say that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's call for a grand jury in Washington is a sign that the Russian investigation is accelerating.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help with an investigation that seeks to determine whether the Trump campaign or its inner circle collaborated with Russia in the U.S. presidential election.
The grand jury is extending Mueller's powers to gather evidence, subpoena people, and force people to testify under oath.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence that the prosecutor has uncovered in the investigation and decide whether to press charges.
A British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand.
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, enter his office, and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who now provides a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to bring the microchip to medical standards.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips used in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also makes locks for homes and cars compatible with the microchip, and it costs £300 to process one lock.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars .
The White House's decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter to the White House's south lawn for an event showcasing American manufactured goods came at a cost to taxpayers of $24,000, according to a report obtained by TIME magazine from military documents.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, which is called Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of an event at the White House on July 17, 2017, to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were able to view products from all 50 states.
In addition to a Connecticut-made helicopter, the exhibit included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter to be on site by mission order only about 36 hours before it landed on the south lawn for an "exceptional" event, according to Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet records.
I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because it is an exceptional event that will get a lot of publicity, the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an email the day before the event to his supervisor, who is the assistant commander of the Naval Aviation.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the south lawn at 7 a.m. on July 17 and that the event would begin at 3 p.m. and that the helicopter would not leave until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The message also stated that if the helicopter was delayed from the White House, additional crew would be needed due to the time constraints.
The original crew was on the helicopter during the incident and unit security personnel were with the helicopter while it was on the ground.
The documents obtained by TIME magazine do not indicate whether another crew was needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States of America prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the files, HMX-1 was investigating whether the incident violated the law.
One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told that it was not, the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're up for it", replied the deputy commander.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke in favor of health care reform, which was then under consideration by the Senate, and looser government regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must wear them when they travel.
But using them for just photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from all 50 states using American materials", said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of HMX-1 regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on the south lawn to bring the president into the White House to within an inch of his actual range.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings on the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit also flew 11 hours of helicopters that day on non-presidential support missions.
The White House says the transaction did not cause any additional costs to the taxpayers.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in the helicopter show on the south lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of presidential missions and an accurate estimate of the cost of the event is difficult.
According to the 2017 Department of Defense hourly compensation, the compensation level for a VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 flight records, the total flight time from Quantico, Virginia to the White House and back was one hour.
The White House says the cost of running a helicopter is significantly lower.
Calculating the cost to taxpayers by level of compensation is misleading, says Walters.
The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called 'embedded costs' which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the aid was granted in breach of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production", Spicer said.
I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their role in ensuring national security and that they probably employ hundreds or thousands of people in that way.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked so hard to build.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up.
It's not clear if Trump was on the helicopter during the event, but at least he was sitting in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President. "I have three of them".
Lightning struck the Vaasa railway and the trains have to be replaced by buses .
Passenger train services between Seinäjoen and Vaasa are suspended due to a technical failure, the Ratali liikenne keskus reports.
The trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The thunder caused a malfunction in the traffic control system.
The railway department had no estimate of the length of the repair as of this morning.
Venezuelan prosecutor demands the right to block the appointment of a new national assembly
The Venezuelan prosecutor has applied for a court order to prevent the appointment of a new delegation.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the delegation elected in last Sunday's vote will be named on Friday.
The country's controversial vote elected a representative body that can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to the Prosecutor General, Luisa Ortega, the decision to block the election was requested because of suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges after a British company which organised the vote in the House of Representatives said the results had been rigged.
The company said that the number of registered voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the actual number.
The 545-member elected House of Representatives includes Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and amend laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as Maduro's way of consolidating his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have indicated that they will not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representative body is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
They have injured numerous people and killed over a hundred.
Venezuela was plunged into an economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Many people today cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to express its views on Friday, when the new parliament is due to start.
A Russian extradited from Finland was sentenced to four years in prison in the United States .
A Minneapolis U.S. District Court on Thursday sentenced Maxim Senah, 41, to nearly four years in prison for his role in a global computer fraud scheme.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 at the request of the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
Finnish border authorities arrested him as he was returning home.
Finland handed over Sena to US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, reports AFP news agency.
He was convicted in March of this year of computer fraud, which had generated millions of dollars in profit.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving his sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly criticized Finland after the arrest and said the man cannot be extradited to the United States.
The statement accused Finland and the United States of having made the arrest in Finland without Russia's prior knowledge.
The prosecutor said that Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish usernames and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data to redirect Internet traffic, which was used to create click fraud and spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, deputy director of the Justice Department's Crime Branch, said the case shows that the United States is also capable of hunting down other cybercriminals.
"We have the ability and the will to identify, find and bring them to justice", Blanco said in a statement.

With Pablo Escobar out of the picture, the Cali cartel is back in the spotlight on the hit Netflix series
Even though the killer of Pablo Escobar was exposed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the show will be returning for a third and fourth season, and the third season trailer has been released, featuring the new villains.
In its third season, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has turned its attention to the Cali Cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company", except for a slightly higher level of corruption and violence by government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) as its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) managing the connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operating in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes the return of Javier Peñana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police to fight the war on drugs.
The new faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro. They are all in the mix.
The third season of Narcos starts on September 1st.
Kari Kola to perform an extraordinary lighting artwork in Paris
Kari Kola (pictured) is a lighting artist from the Congolese province of Niger who is creating an extraordinary lighting artwork to commemorate the first United Nations Day of Light in Paris on May 16.
Kola is in Paris to do a lighting art piece called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness, day and night, sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building, UNESCO's headquarters, and the Globe monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness in my work.
Today, light pollution in cities of millions is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
"My art allows me to bring things that I feel are important to concrete view", says light artist Kari Kola.
I am very pleased to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the 2015 Year of Light theme, when she lit up the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to bring my art back to UNESCO headquarters", says Kari Kola.
The work may yet be expanded very significantly.
We will report on this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.

Two men got into an argument in the parking lot of the Big Apple shopping mall in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when one of the parties accidentally drove in a restricted direction.
There was a verbal altercation between the drivers.
A driver who was driving in a restricted direction would hit the driver of the other car, causing the car to move and collide with the hitman's car.
After that, he hit the engine of the car that hit him.
The man has admitted to causing harm and wrongdoing in the preliminary hearing.
From Timo Soini, question-mark article entitled "After the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (UK) published a blog post on Thursday, which is headed with a question mark.
It's a short piece, only two sentences long.
In my time the party grew from zero to the governing party of 37 MPs.
Then the flood came, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin's text has references to 18th century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the flood analogy.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases "the flood after us" or "the flood after me" have made their way into the history books.
The UN says Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
The elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, are able to vote, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the acting head of the UN relief mission, said that hundreds of women were running for provincial council elections, three were running for vice-president and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters were women.
The role of women cannot be overemphasized, Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
The only way to ensure that elections are truly representative and credible is for women to participate fully and be included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have been making threats about elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the contribution of women is strengthening Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists is a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of the locals is particularly directed at the cruise ship-based form of tourism.
The Italian minister of culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: people spend only a few hours in a destination and rush through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is a swamp for tourists who take a quick day trip to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate, and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that Venice is no longer able to accommodate the crowds.
They have been forced to move further and further from the historic centre as hotels have replaced homes.
The problems of tourism in Venice are reported by The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restricting the number of tourists.
They call what we have today low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you'll be given two or three hours.
Follow the flag-bearing guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes Dario Franceschini, Italy's minister of culture, the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in their architecture but also in the functioning of the place, the shops and the workshops.
We have to preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic center of Venice.
At the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
The local anger is also directed mainly at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to only 50,000 locals.
In 1951 the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has eroded their quality of life, destroyed the environment, and driven out the inhabitants.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this keeps up, in a few years, there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, one of the organizers of the protest.
The equation is difficult, since the ships bring Venice much-needed income and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is to move cruise ships away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative region, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice receives between 20 and 30 million tourists each year.
You driving to Kuopio?
Highway traffic jams for miles
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the northbound lanes have been congested for miles during the Thursday afternoon return traffic from work.
The area is being paved with highways, which is slowing traffic, Savon Sanomat reports.
The data is limited to 50 km/h instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even within the 30-mile (50-kilometer) limitation zone, traffic had progressed by Thursday afternoon, but in some places it was practically walking.
On Thursday afternoon, the work progressed on the side of Silk Lake near the statue of the Apocalypse, or golden goat.
I'm fine without that kind of attention.
The 23-year-old runner has been subjected to public scorn.
Amalie Iuel has published some amazing photos of herself in places like the Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in her home country of Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400 meters by running a lap of 51.81.
A month later, he improved on the Norwegian record of 55.38 in the 400-meter hurdles.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who was a keen social media user, realized that fame and publicity have a downside.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Luella, apparently in the hope of attracting the attention of a young runner.
I had to shut down my Snapchat account from outside.
I received a lot of "dirty photos" from unknown people, so I had to make my account private, Iuel told VG.
In the interview with VG, Luel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can guess, I think, that's when Luel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I'm fine without all that other attention.
I was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father Danish-Norwegian.
Juliel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was two.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia and then to Pakistan because of her father's job.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
After spending four years as a university athlete at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, people are much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In America, coaches don't ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in the 400 metres and the 400 metres hurdles.
A foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korven's entire career on the line. Now competing in the World Championships.
It's been nice counting now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has once again been able to truly enjoy his beloved sport this season.
Just last summer, my career was on the line.
A stress leg injury had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg would not heal.
He had a gunshot wound to the arm in the race track.
I had no idea what I was doing this summer, whether to continue with the boarding or not.
Sponsorship deals were cut and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor renewed his contract for two years, and the blood started to flow again.
After that, it was easy to decide.
I didn't know that until the first time I went out in the snow.
I was like, "Oh, man, this is so much fun, let's just go through a few more".
The raven didn't get to count properly until September or October, but after a long break from landing, just training without pain has been a big deal.
The Raven has only been to a few races.
It's all right.
Competition has never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're in a fever that week.
I can't think about it, says the Raven.
Today, the Raven will compete in the World Cup halfpipe in the Spanish Sierra Nevada.
Although individual competitions don't keep him in the board game, in a tough group, he always gets fired up.
Korven said that the prestige of the International Ski Federation's competitions has grown in recent years, even though some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
It's a big race, it's a big show.
Although I think that the value always depends on the conditions and the level of competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-man Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's youngest players, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to see the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that stage where everything was new and I was so sick of everything.
It brings new energy to itself, Raven thinks.
I'm still kind of keeping up on the line, but not the other way around, because that's how much energy you guys have!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of legendary director Pekka Korven is addicted to racing: the racer has his own racing horses for which he makes training programs.
I'm always on the road, and I don't have time to be in the mess anymore.
But I check at least the nutritional results every day and usually some of the outputs, says Korpi.
According to Korve, the potential career paths for him are rowing and training when his rowing career comes to an end.
I don't want to go that far, but it's a very likely option.
I feel it so much, it's like I'm learning it here on the snowboard.
I'm trying to keep up with the times and keep evolving, maybe even take some trips in the summer.
If that's my future profession, then it's not hard to start once you're already in the game.
The events will also include a live-aboard cruise with presenter Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The pair have chartered a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet food competition.
The raven and the birdland decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has been a commercial success and people have been excited.
We're already at the point where we're not going to go bankrupt.
"We have a few months to go, hopefully we can fill the ship", says Raven excitedly.
Attendo 's care of Kite has taken everyone by surprise .
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-bed nursing home being built on the island of Cyprus.
A new 1,700-square-foot building across the street from the health center will be completed next summer.
The general question is why the new unit is so crowded, since many private nursing homes are now understaffed during the Sioux War.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Nursing Services, commented that in the future there will be an increased demand for not only alternative but also enhanced service housing in Kite.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought the private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Erika from Kite last year.
The sale was for business purposes, but the properties are known to have a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
We'll talk more about it later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of operations at the McVitie's factory in Scotland.
The trade union is asking the managers of McVitie's to confirm their long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the UK General Trade Union GMB Scotland, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, has over 500 employees.
Pladis, the company that owns the McVities brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives would be certain to be the first to be informed if there were any changes in the operations.
In its letter to the plant manager, GMB asked the company to response to its concerns about the lack of funding for the modernisation of the production lines.
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned that the plant manager does not have clear information on the business needs of Tollcross and its future investment plans.
Families have worked here for generations and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area.
In terms of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and continued production cuts, East Glasgow is in dire need of a thriving McVities production.
According to Pladis' spokesman, the factory manager had received the union's letter only the day before and the company responded to it directly, as it appreciates the continuous interaction with workers and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with workers and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly assess all our operations and locations in order to remain competitive.
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and improvements to its operations.
We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant and will be the first to tell the workers and trade union representatives if we are going to make any changes to the operation of the plant.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
The league may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after paying 189 million pounds to terminate his contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about event of the summer, with the French Ligue 1 side poised to break the world record for transfer fees, less than half the previous record set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89m.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive footballer in the world and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him a salary of over 500,000 pounds a week after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be furious at PSG's actions and the way Neymar has been forcibly removed from the team, and a source close to Barcelona says the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we will be their opponent and we will contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances, and it is possible that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar because of this.

Trump's glowing phone calls were fabricated, White House spokesman says "I wouldn't say it was a lie".
The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, reports The New York Times.
Trump's wiretapped phone calls to both the president of Mexico and the head of the Boy Scouts have turned out to be fabricated.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the Scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump had a conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the Hamburg G20 summit.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty harsh accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders argued.
The speech to the Boy Scouts was met with outrage.
Trump said Monday that the president of Mexico called him and praised Trump's success in stamping out illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will cross the southern border of Mexico anymore because they know the journey will be to the US border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not occurred.
On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
It was Trump's glowing speech at the National Scout Association convention in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scout leader, and he said it was the greatest speech they'd ever been given.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts announced that they were not aware of any calls from any of their senior officials to Trump.
The statement said that the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, had previously apologized to the Scouts for Trump's speech.
Trump's speech at the Scout Association meeting caused a lot of buzz because it was unusually political for the nature of the event.
Among other things, he was glowing about the results of the presidential election last autumn.
