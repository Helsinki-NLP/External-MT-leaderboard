UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had made this situation unsolvable.
Ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they succeeded in reaching an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
Eight figures from the polls that show that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how many Republicans try to tear Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads by a two-figure percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul's chances of being appointed.
Of course, it's still too early.
None of this says Trump will win the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight so hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit to Trump's power and start supporting him financially.
Here are some recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a transient thing:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These numbers hold.
A survey last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump won the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "suppressed" if Trump won the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be enthusiastic versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "outraged" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the personality to be a leader, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
Yet 44 percent believe he doesn't have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament isn't what he's looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who had the highest chance of winning the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump did.
The situation changed from late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters didn't read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these numbers show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or the Republicans are backing up to another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone.
Some rumors say the split will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support for Trump will be divided among more than a dozen candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get the majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they will not change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to changing their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters who say they voted with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violents" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central topic of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
According to a poll by ABC/Post on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A two-week-old survey in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the performance of congressional Republicans, with 54 percent saying they are unhappy and 21 percent nervous at the top.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Ever since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at the Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he demanded less theatre and more action.
He also stated that he can give up some participations and that he is giving them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he appointed a 'ghost cabinet' and after his speech at TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent on the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had kept quiet respectfully and acknowledged the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England.
But a member of Mr Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
About a dozen ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leadership team, arguing for differences of opinion over economics, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences have been building up within the Labour Party since Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position on the European Union and the benefits limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party was very clear in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron on the podium in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas from outside sources for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and that he would refrain from retaliation and attacks, instead committing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will hold his seat at the PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak on occasion, saying he had approached the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took office, Mr Cameron stated that he wanted to give up the political style Punch and Judy often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his endeavor.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, the way he leads the House of Representatives and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs a deep reform.

JD Sports' boss says higher salaries could hurt the expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says that an increase in the UK minimum wage could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.
However, it is unlikely that this purchasing power will exceed the higher labour costs within the company, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the storm created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called the Special Ks, was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous defeat of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a crunch qualifier game played shortly after in Cincinnati, the bench umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated, "Wawrinka should have knocked Kyrgios down, and I should have knocked this kid down".
Although he was last seen making a powder rocket after suffering muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in singles, behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn into a bit of conflict", Healy said.
The truth is he broke a missile when he lost because he blamed cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a missile out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But to be honest, he's handled himself extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's a very hard worker and he's integrated into the team, he's had no conflicts with other players, he's very well respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in excellent shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios for the important draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the joint decision as the best fit for all, but supported the return of the original Canberra player to the team in the long term.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think at all about the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick climbed really fast, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in front of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not the center of attention to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-figure lead in the Democratic national run, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the primary election starts, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they're supporting.
But Clinton's supporters are more determined in their election than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton keeps the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among the men has dropped considerably and Sanders is only five points away.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has vanished, now being on par with Sanders.
Yet Clinton still has the upper hand among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was up against Sanders, with a two-figure percentage, among the liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in that group.
About half of the Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were chosen to run for the party.
One quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about first-place Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it's time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she's the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential run, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him running - although a third think he shouldn't.
When asked about the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters nominate Biden as the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he doesn't run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general election; however, the numbers have dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is far second, but the percentage of eligible voters has risen.
However, when asked what's most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
As last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in some key features against their party's primary voters.
Most voters view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity-filled and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is trustworthy and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15%), but 27% don't think so.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, share the same ideologies.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say it did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion on this issue was split in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the email controversy did not affect their overall view of Clinton, although 36% say they changed their view negatively.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they've changed their mind about Clinton in a negative way.
While Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integral and trustworthy, this aspect continues to raise concerns among voters at the general level: only 32% consider Clinton to be integral and trustworthy, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be integrated or trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Yet both Clinton and Trump have white leadership balls.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of people who consider Sanders to be an integral part of the story is higher than the number who disagree, but as with Carson, many people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity charged with murdering a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, a 14-pound backpack filled with sand was placed behind her and she was repeatedly shot while trying to head for a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claimed they would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood practically before the good of Michael Deng", Wagner said.
He couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head, torso and thigh injuries.
"For many families, the brotherhood rituals have devastated them, since 1970 at least one student has lost their lives each year because of the rituals", Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this action by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with outrage and complicity in murder.
"We want to hold not only the people involved to account but if there is an organization that has authorized the Brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it to account", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to happen and how long it's going to last.
In economics, history provides little indication of timing.
After the first increase would be the rate of interest, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment the interest rate starts to rise but on the time trajectory needed for normalization.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in play.
However, in the end, the market players might find that the whole excitement surrounding the interest rate increase was exaggerated.
The first rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the 'cheap money' era, said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But you can't say there won't be any effects.
Here's how some sectors of the economy might react based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating interest rate increases may volatilize things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
 There appears to be a trend for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the breakdown in monetary policy again, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after Fed increases.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - towards an interest rate increase, fairly unchanged over the 250-day period afterwards (average rise of 2.6%) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the Chief Strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate cycle and the benefits begin to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the present situation, the Fed is faced with conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
In particular, gross domestic product will be approaching its historic low point for a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was below 4,5%.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect the situation to continue, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question of whether this time is different, Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a Fed decision to increase their share of the market for the entire year, with all eyes on this week's Federal Open Market Commission meeting, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase at this meeting, forward transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
In our post-1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super-cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery began, the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it's now 74 months and it's still going on.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decline in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, the yield on the bonds decreases immediately, Deutsche stated.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will bring the short-term and long-term bond yields closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds perform better in such an environment, although there are still precautions to strengthen yield, said Kathy Jones, a Schwab fixed income analyst in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
In addition to the strength of the dollar and the estimated decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy, Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is more straight, the spread of the average credit rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all of the market characteristics when the Fed tights policy.
In large part, companies that operate mainly in the USA will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational debt holders will suffer because the rise of the dollar will cause their products to be more expensive in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
History shows that quality stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial rate hike, Goldman Sachs analyst stated in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
The companies with high capital returns and low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Duty will become a major issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have to profit from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save might also have gains, though experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
Radio 3 is a copy of the BBC Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for "simply
It claims to be increasingly similar to the trade rival
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the British Awards
Co-host Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove it's doing something commercial stations don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was becoming more and more like a commercial rival.
"I feel like Radio 3 is messing up - though I don't like to use the word - but I feel like it's turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what's already on the market", said Mr Bingham.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out about classical music anywhere I can hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivaled.
"In addition, I think it's also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new pieces", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to engage audiences than the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC item criticized at the Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there's so much talk about this show because it's not original and it's not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be done in a BBC-specific manner.
He added that he wants the Corporation to find the golden egg chicken in its own yard the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or spend the money that goes on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and could be blamed for Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month saw the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could cause spending retention.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the shopping streets of the UK into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
If we look at the growth rate from previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a trend to streamline over time, Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phone to shop.
So there was an increase in the number of people who could shop online and they could do so in different circumstances, like on the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you might notice a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crammed into their computers to get their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers were beating themselves up, could trigger reticence.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ out of every 5 £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to go to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After the sanctioning of the bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed in the Makkah Macaral collapse
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured in the crash of the macara
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed macrame at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their deaths joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of their final journey, to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy place where just a few days ago a construction block collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also claimed 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed macrame at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the caravan crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the squid's arm up when the squid was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language news agency service did not provide any details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the collapse of the makara in the Grand Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made any declarations on the collapse of the macarole and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for any declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of mosques surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and has been running major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a son of a renegade, disinherited by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong winds and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims receive one million Saudi Riyal (£174,000) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers to convert loans into Swiss francs into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of interest rates.
The disadvantages may come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
The Bank of Transylvania has just completed the process of converting the loans into francs granted by Volksbank and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers a three-year fixed interest rate at 1.5% lei, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvanian Bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: a reduction in the balance of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, followed by an additional 22,5% reduction in the lei balance.
Both offers reduce their own customers' rates, compared to their monthly equivalent payment in lions before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvanian Bank reduced the rate by 42,5%, Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the loan coverage in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected by future increases in the franc, and the loan will be repaid in the currency in which he earns his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no property revaluation is required, no additional guarantees and no further proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a monthly rate reduction compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lions.
The risk
The problem is that the rate in the early years is mostly interest, and the client pays very little of the principal.
Bancpost's very low interest rate offer for the first three years seems to be advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this interest will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans with variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will rise significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, three months ago, the ROBOR was now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009 it was over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs not mentioned in the initial offer may also arise.
It's time for the U.S. Federal Reserve to decide on the interest rate.
The world is looking forward to the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0 to 0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and start a process of normalizing interest rates, said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been developing relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low inflation rate.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less-than-pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday at 20:00 CET.

In 2001 she battled leukemia and in 2009 lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.

All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw is on the bench for a couple of months for double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the Champions League match against Manchester United, which ended in a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bench for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred as a result of a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal stated: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then operated on in Manchester.
It's awful -- a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he struggles, then plays fantastic, and now something like that happens.
He's got an oxygen mask in his locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the break is six months and won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems Moreno was lucky and got rid of the red card and the granting of a penalty kick.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's faulty and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I'm starting my recovery journey, I'm coming back stronger".
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in the PSV defeat
The England team's back has an extra reason to recover to play the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very ugly injury.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to crash an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against the Van Gaal-led Netherlands national team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't mean to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not okay", Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but still holds firm
The victory against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task but after seeing the England team selected for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in Test matches.
I wouldn't rule out a possible victory on the move.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago but they have good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the testing level, is an option for the attack.
Subject: Adam Lyth left the England squad for the Test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it's hard for me to analyze the decision not to field Adam Lyth.
He played seven Test matches against two good strikers under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by their results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - players are their own selectors.
Fifty years old and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when his performance was not up to his ability and I'm not surprised by that; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a batsman gets noticed in Test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England had preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in his prime - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is on the team, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricketer who has the X Factor and I noticed him early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors but this will of course depend on the UAE team.
It was the idea that Moeen would open up to the bat next to Cook, which would lead to extra spinners while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proven himself to be a fucking loser.
Moeen may not have brought success to his county of Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches 38 as a first-class drop before entering the Open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari is coming into the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age - an average of 31 at bat and 35 at ball - and they could think he's a point, but there aren't a lot of spinners and the selectors have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England have made some changes to the coaching staff as well.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for Test matches could be a master blow.
He's one of the best players and he'll bring a lot of experience, given that he's played in every situation and against every kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unbridled ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they're sending messages that were already sent, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes is taking a break for one day's games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and scouts don't make the schedule.
And you have to remember, the jobs of players depend on the results they get.
Decisions like this are never easy to make.
The Brexit camp could have a cause-and-effect gain if the economy stays calm until 2017
As time goes on, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more messy, even without the election of the genius Jeremy Yes or no? Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TUC is bringing serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained recently that - sunk in crises similar to the EU's - not all of them being domestically provoked - some member states are fueled by the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, TUC decided that they too would not want to do this if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with an outward perspective under the EU roof - 'Don't leave us alone with France,' Berlin says - suggests that more ministers and senior officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the highly cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation gets worse, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to believe that these will help the British who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers might even plan to make deliberate comments that don't help, like the SNP, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The renegotiation was fixed and the UK did not gain any value from the renegotiation.
Europeans know from their faces how catchy Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons are about the EU with skepticism, because they didn't participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into the EU in a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of non-taxpaying handbags, foreigners who cheated on the phone, and pseudo non-domestics who owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give her the bananas to distract her from the thought of having lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a cardboard exit.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back of his friendship Monday at Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me anymore - seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC he left off on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would call evolutionary indulgence.
It says it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most people who disagree with the conservative Anglicanism might agree with that.
That's what Hilary Benn, but not Benn, said on radio and TV this week when his investigator struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow minister for finance was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be unfaithful to fellow workers, without going too far and losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay in any situation - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of what image Corbyn wants to convey -- remember, it made me feel the same way -- message discipline remains important in the age of television and especially in the social media sphere, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a ticket to Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell claimed.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism about EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistication about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters there - on concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial team joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the report last month and described it as a complex analysis of the evidence.
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the extraordinary frailty base on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ have questioned the claims and their foundation on solid earth or moving sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, stated: A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.
They stated that they expected that the PHE claims that current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking would be based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model that summarized their views on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, it claimed.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that they are reported to have received from the tobacco and cigarette company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on which the panel members were selected were not provided but some of them are known to be 'frontlines' in the production of e-cigarettes, some of whom even declare financing for the industry in the paper.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the tobacco control section of the PHE also attended the meeting.
The research work carried out by the group convincingly demonstrates that there is a lack of solid evidence of the harmful effect of most products according to most criteria, McKee and Capewell claimed.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that there is so far no evidence that e-cigarettes are a smoking encouragement factor among children or non-smokers are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded to the BMJ's claims in the past.
He stated: E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking
One in two people who have smoked their whole lives loses their lives because of this habit.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to study their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is and is not evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related illness, and the annual costs to the national health system from smoking reach £2 billion.
By making clear the current evidence - that while using e-cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effects of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Advertisements that embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Horrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing the ankles!
Dispersed bombs!
And electric sticks that cause terrible pain without leaving any trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a harsh charade, made by Amnesty International to underscore the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to a large number of posters being displayed in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
 Important announcement, traveling with DLRs between 15 and 18 September? says one of the announcements, using London Underground fonts and branding, the DLR line turning into a tank image.

The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using Ad Space Hack Packs, a 6-pound package of Allen keys that they claim facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet.
London transport is not amused by this 'vandalism' in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and looking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving toward working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.

The film, made by Amnesty, has had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voiceover artist also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms fair ad - with a blank space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "We should offer them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They played with making a more realistic ad but enriching it with animation and powerful colors, it was more striking.
"They did a great job of helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the subject of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the US military regarding AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.
It includes a unique-shaped flashlight that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules for living in a home

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common, rather "weird" project, as he himself calls it, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians who perform a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: one performance on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, in which the celloist Xavier Phillips was in the lead, the works composed by Enescu being unparalleled.
Both performances, performed on the stage of Athens, showed the audience a different way of performing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and was, at the time, the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand musicians need an education to either become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialised workers".
They themselves feel they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, the whole musical fetishism is centered on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, is marketing itself.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on one side, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but has to watch, which is stupid again", says David Grimal.
The violinist relates that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of "musical disappointments" in his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my 30s, I found this very depressing, because I couldn't find creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So I didn't find any sense in continuing down this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This is happening in 2004, and at that time nobody would do this without a conductor: "The very conservative music world didn't want these projects".
"How do you imagine marketing a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", noting that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a barrier to the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex a repertoire we sing, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are required to be present in the opera and not just in the role", says Grimal, adding that at the Sunday show "we had 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave one", precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the world's greatest orchestras are present and sing three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, like the Enescu Festival, there is the place and the interest for something different, breaking down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the famous Romanian composer's Romanian music, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there was also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is campaigning for a change in the way classical music education is done, believing that "the profession of musician as it is organized today has a dying legacy" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it's useless.
In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people who were artists and not trade representatives.
To me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, they're all amazing, extraordinary, but as long as they're in the music business.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it has no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you joined the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to pass health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are used by supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds maybe not very beautiful, but when we cut them they're real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should be back in the center and the institutions and industries that run this system should understand that music doesn't need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
"If we considered - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things about humanity, we would reintroduce its teaching in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television, and by this education we would no longer need to sell musical byproducts", Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we train a musician to play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be some way, if we want to train a musician, it's something completely different.
After your pardon, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" the French artist asked smiling.
Grimal points out that for artists, the reward for a different way of making music comes from exceeding this "soldier" status, exceeding what "they think are their limits": "Musicers discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after a concert there are smiles".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision for music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a public discussion organized by the Aspen Institute Romania at the George Enescu International Festival.
The following is the list of the countries of the European Union:
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.
Grimal has an international solo career, during which he has regularly given concerts for the past 20 years on the world's leading classical music scenes and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the Orchestre National de Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestre de l'Opéra de Lyon, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Warsaw Symphony, under the direction of conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Kri, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Andelsbeck and Peter Eris Ebosch, Christian Argos, Christian N. Burns.
He was the recipient of dedicated works by several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
In addition to his solo career, David Grimal has continued to explore more personal projects.
The freedom that his collaboration with Les Dissonances gave him allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Together with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a charity concert series with homeless people at the church of Saint-Leu, in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Opera dijon.
He teaches violin at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many master classes and was a jury member of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quijote", a violin designed for him by the French lutenist Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year's George Enescu International Festival alongside the Orchestra Les Dissonances, with Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven on the programme.
Les Dissonances also took the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the lead, and the programme was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for Big Little Voices
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for kids: dubbing two characters from the super-production "Snow White 3D"
You have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign for enthusiastic, ambitious, future stars, ages 8 to 16, Cinema City is looking for "Big Little Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to play two characters from a famous animated film.
Whereas classic cartoons emphasized the proximity of the actor's voice to the character's specific character, recently, the story creators are also considered, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we're launching a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They're going to have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a cast", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organises a pre-selection where 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected to give a rehearsal in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the microvoice.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register their child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Then, they have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts the child is going to read, and then the child will record playing their own dubbing version.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can be selected by the contestants to support the trial: "Yellow Feet 3D", "Mune: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The 3D Polar Koala" and "The White Maya 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will each play a character from the super production "The Snow Queen - The Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx's earnings are mixed, the 2016 tax forecast declines
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the shipping giant reducing its profit estimates for the full year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The decreasing estimate comes despite the increase in prices by 4,9% on average, with effect from 4 January and higher surcharges for the land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it still expects to increase profits over the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
Fred Smith, President and CEO, stated that the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade.
The holiday recruitment plans were announced a day after competitor UPS stated that it intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of recruits it did last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, down from the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit has increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the total at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which has led to a stagnation in the revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has disrupted the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, ground division revenues increased by 29%, but operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while the revenue recorded by the freight division decreased due to increasing costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had fallen by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they had fallen by 11% year-on-year and by 17% from the record high on 11 June.
On the eve of the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policy makers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank's meeting room, there will be a mural of the United States.
The map is intended to remind Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's president, and her colleagues that they must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the employment rate of the U.S. labor force and to maintain price stability.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision that's too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and that will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be unleashed by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate on federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
Obviously, labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues to be pursued, said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
I believe, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the rising uncertainty in the global market would be enough to give them reason to wait longer, she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself causes financial market instability.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
But the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, except if policy makers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep interest rates steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised interest rates at this time", Lonski said.
If the Fed's decision makers were to do this, they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.
Other experts have stated that an increase in interest rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed set to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected interest rates to rise this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers to be total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed decision makers said one key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy can and needs higher rates given the labour market tensions, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to spiral at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in China's economy would slow global growth.
The market has receded somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May peak.
For Fed decision-makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate growth.
Without what's happened in financial markets and the news of China's weakening economy in recent weeks, the meeting would be more firm, said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and they have almost no data to base on subsequent events in China, Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
The simple allusion by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might be "in a hurry" monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly congested, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress elsewhere, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
Its decision-making process is more art than science, said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wellness management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that the Fed has a history of overreaction to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, the decision-making body that supported the interest rate increase, gave as an example the decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings,  despite the implications with limited identifiability for US development, Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on those declines.
The Fed should only put the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The last period of turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to be in a situation where we fear a rise in interest rates because markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in that regard, I don't think it should take premature action.
Looking for a fabulous market with Thai specific?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/deposit opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a high-end Thai marketplace that also sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/depot is a universal store offering an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated produce, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's also a car park where you have to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to walk all the aisles.
If you get hungry from so much shopping, eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior food area of the store (good, affordable) is close to the houses and offers several options for preparations that can be taken at the package.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You probably found it at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and certain items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat yard is big, and so is the fish yard - the staff who serve will clean and steal the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
A large part of the store is dedicated to the giant freezer district, where you'll find curry leaves, frozen peppers and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef, pig carcasses, fish scales, traditional, semi-prepared sausages and more.
Who buys from there: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
On the wide lanes, shopping carts and forklifts are crowded.
Discovered: fresh durian fruit just outside the house area.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - just a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own common parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there is a chance that the store will be crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite attempts by Nine to air on the Today Show about the change in party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to broadcast on the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring about a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Nine's morning broadcast was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of a few weeks that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance crossover did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today at 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday's audiences (317.000) and last Tuesday's audiences (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday's audiences (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average viewership of 349,000 and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all through the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the tide of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
This is a list of the countries of the European Union.
The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was capable of doing a show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night answered loudly yes.
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained in the spotlight, with 1.136 million viewers, slightly above The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded the ups and downs on the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show (17:00 to 17:30) averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The lowering of the Chase Australia audience on the second night will give the Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, the show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of gunfire at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal claimed that the police forces used tear gas after which they fired into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are commonly used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes on August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country governed at a central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops, or guns.
The Prime Minister continues to exchange replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We're doing everything we can to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or armed police.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s". said Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister also said that all the details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and agreed at the CSAT meeting on Thursday. " the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure front about 560 km south of Cape Verde's southernmost point has a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone forming over the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who have non-surgical treatments.
It takes a long time to centralize mortality data, said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
The mass of the product, measured in units of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5-24,9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and that people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the diaphragm - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in surgical subjects decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical diabetes treatment remained nearly the same, at 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the medical group, by comparison, diabetes fully cured only 1% and partially cured only 2% of the subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimum hemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the medical group, it stayed at about 8%.
But this improved glycemic control - reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with a gastrectomy in the cuff, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1), and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery extends life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, Phoenix School of Medicine.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery had about a 29% lower chance of dying after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who had surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic outlook for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
This is where this paper is critical, as it claims that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they accumulate these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies, predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe.
Europe could not accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end violence in the refugees' mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
It also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
'It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe', he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
It is wonderful to take care of a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we must think about long-term solutions to bring about peace and genuine development, especially through education, in Muslim countries, he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved these problems, he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the US had generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences, the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children who ingested hand detergent in the last four years
According to the Georgia Center for Poisoning, U.S. poisoning centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Center for Poisoning, the number of children under 12 years of age who ingest hand detergent at poisoning centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more access to these products, and unfortunately, one percent of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children drink laundry intentionally and others do so to impress their friends or respond to social media challenges.
You can watch videos on YouTube showing teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that the teenagers mixed the mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts them", Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types of hand sanitizer are scented ones.
Strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital's anti-poison center, for Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places, and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently had four strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
She had an alcohol content of 179, twice the legal limit for an adult to be considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was barking and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or wet towels and not to leave hand detergent at the children's disposal.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their teacher by putting antibacterial products in their classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be meaningless and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the title race is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summary of Celtic's games; why?
Because they're not Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the Rangers coming back.
It's about the Old Firm.
It's about both teams together and that's where the interest goes.
The tension is high in the Old Firm games and it's not just the Scots who want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises you.
Ronnie Deila has accepted that Celtic are fighting hard but the Norwegian boss has promised to change the situation.
The defeat of Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat of 10 man-made Aberdeen, now at the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had periods before and they'll come back".
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that's how players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's caution regarding January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting he had identified some goals for the January transfer, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the unity of Ibrox.
The former Brentford boss said: "The transfer window in January is very different from the one in summer.
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period when they can be integrated, which you could have observed this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do worse by bringing in unnecessary players.
Celtic is targeting Michu after retreat
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested he could retire at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts facing SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the red card of the bottom was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance".
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The Invincible Hibee was caught after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment", the striker said, adding: "I need not say I will not return to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic".
Tannadice Council has confidence in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still have confidence that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the downturn on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape, Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for the dirty victory against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must cling desperately to the Hamilton Accies to win their seventh consecutive league title, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to the penalty kick from the first replay by Adam Rooney.
McInnes stated: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won matches like that".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5,9% in Scotland was higher than that of the United Kingdom at 5,5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12 000 over the three months, to the current level of 2.612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74,0% - a figure above the UK average of 73,5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: 'The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy'.
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
During the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll watch a man be sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observer room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary execution room and watch Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of the cause approaches, I'm terrified of the idea.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole death penalty story.
It would give a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because the demands usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of press seats from 12 to five.
The elected will watch the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I also developed my own connection with him through months of phone conversations and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'm gonna have to try and remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He acknowledged that he could have put it better, but he still feels he's wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if he asked me.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be present to write about it.
He thinks if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we've made.
I'm not coming back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For that, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll learn what it's like to watch a man I love die for nothing.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being Lady Tatai's elimination from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the spy statements and didn't want to look like the wolf that doesn't reach the grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I was silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything just goes up in a flash", Moody said.
He's known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I've said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go head-to-head and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying my best.
The moment they start to believe that's not happening, I have to quit my coaching job.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview for racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I'll say if asked - and they offered to hire him at my barn to provide information about the activity there", Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, he thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and they know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can hold people outside the coaching staff accountable for what's happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe he should take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now could lead him to think about this option.
But I've reached a point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on him and I'll get him to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The coach's frustration increased with the lengthy investigation into the cobalt testing that Lidari was involved in and the removal led him to say he could just put his license on the table.
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after applying mud or clay cataplasm to the horses' legs, which violated the rules.
It's a breach of race rules.
I must take full responsibility for this, he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day treatment involving the application of cataplasm, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed but it went too far", Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and followed by a hit-and-run.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
Monday, a 50-year-old man turned himself in to Shepparton police.
It looks like he's gonna be charged with run-off the road, first aid and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is answering his opponents in wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the playoff tactics used by his team "disinfected subjects" brought up by the NRL's top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to take the team to the next level in the Storm's nervous victory in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the match a "rugby league demonstration" and stated that the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into defending the playoff tactic his team approached and stated that players simply focused on contact when they were playing.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on touch in the plays and so we've changed the situation.
Trent's been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We laugh like it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of reviving football, reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra that Bennett's Dragons won the championship in 2010 playing football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was, Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about black under the nails.
But now he has a team that can play what I consider to be exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to play with players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when they thought of big games.
Bellamy also highlighted that the Storm-Roosters game was a more bitter score-related match compared to the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good one, I haven't seen it yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, we had two more tries in our game, so that means exciting game?
Or is it thrilling to take breaks and not mark?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm is off this weekend because they've won the right to play home to either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday's prelims final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to get pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images of children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police looked at the five photos and then analyzed the computers found at the address and found worrying searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of the subject.
Hogg claimed he did it to lure pedophiles on the Internet before he claimed he was a cop to scare them.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said it's an addiction - that it's addictive to scare people.
He admitted to doing the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and how he asked that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to seduce.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making or taking indecent photographs of child subjects, and violated conditions of parole on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court at the appearance on 24 March this year.
The defence's lawyer, Gregor Sim, has asked Hogg not to be registered as a sex offender because it can be argued that this crime did not involve a significant sexual aspect.
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentence until October, citing social media concerns.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
He was put on the sex offender registry before his sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell down the steps of a podium.
He was not hurt but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed they had received anonymous death threats, threatening not to threaten Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they beat him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it's titled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that the immunity applies only to Parliament and that once they leave Parliament, the parliamentary immunity has no value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is going to make 30,000 redundancies.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the services sector.
This year, HP will be split into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from the fast-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected availability will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-effective structure, said Meg Whitman, HP's president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style, Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions to companies.
It is a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the purpose of producing electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was named the Silicon Valley League.
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the industry, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching their peak in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, seeking to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if a patient is surrounded by enough friends with a healthy mood, their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a healthy circle of friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality, isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal development and friendship -- that affect our mental health even more profoundly.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't really buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it drew attention to this idea.
Characters were defined not by work but by their own personality, which they showed through interaction as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when he watches football in his comfortable armchair, and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men can be known to associate with this situation, even though they often avoid fully exploring their feelings.
As a social worker explained to me: ...my role in listening to suicidal and depressed people showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.
Often, people who call on us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying about coping with yourself is as strong as the feeling of being perceived as weak when you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The show highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much help as objective, outside intervention through the phone, people in desperate times, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you're attending this weekend's FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with full footage of the filming to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is aired by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to put Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG to establish themselves against Swedish side Malmo.
Here's the chronicle of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, starting the series of Champions League group matches with a calming 2-0 win against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into the start of his Champions League debut for PSG, bringing the French champions to the advantage despite missing a number of occasions before securing his lead with the Cavani goal in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French team's goal is not only to qualify in the top-flight but also to improve their run to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting his opportunity to score after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
It's not easy to win at home or on the road in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next rankings, even if there are still aspects that we need to improve on throughout the season, Blanc says.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't score another goal or two.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he scored on Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before striking out incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long corner on the right side of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by clapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and came on the field with nine starts to the national teams, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for the kick from Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, giving several unnecessary passes and unfinishing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries in the first replay only and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic proved much more adept at supporting his colleagues, however, with his step being the one that Di Maria sent in a deviant shot by Wiland across the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after one hour of play, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from centre to Maxwell.
This goal eliminated the Malmo hopes that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the repulsion David Luiz kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi canceled his goal in overtime.
The Norwegian manager of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later claimed that PSG were a top class and that the last match we played in the Champions League was last December.
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Put down your hat for PSG.
They played a great game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the fall in stock prices on the stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to settle the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is on the brink of collapsing commodity exchange prices because the decline in China's economic activity is affecting demand and causing disaster in the markets.
The preferential subscription right has raised the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
The shares rose by 2,77% to SZ 131,60 in the FTSE 100, which opened at a value of 0,69%.
Glencore has unveiled the sale of $2.5 billion in stock as part of its broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of SCH 125 per share, down 2.4% from the closing price on Tuesday.
It has taken out 1.3 billion shares of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the prolonged stagnation of the Chinese economy led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half and to a decrease in coal, copper and other commodities of 20-40%.
Xi is insisting on expanding the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy must open up more widely to the outside world to fuel growth.
China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve its opening-up policies, Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider market opening.
The State authorities will also weaken the controls they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
The Commission also noted that the Chinese authorities have not yet established a formal agreement with the Chinese authorities on the implementation of the measures.
In an attempt to open up the state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened up to private investment.
The State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services, according to the declaration.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called green cards, optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the right to practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions dissatisfied with the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and leaders of the Education trade unions have not achieved any result, with the Government proposing a 10% wage increase from 1 December, with pay to 1 January 2016, and the unions wanting a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10% we were promised today is less than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have agreed to in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016", said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Point: In the future, health and education will be the areas where we're going to invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will be held, in which representatives of the Government will also participate to present the proposal to the representatives of the country's confederations, and the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the government is trying to send the wages bill to Parliament as soon as possible so that it can come into force on December 1.
The legislation provides for a 25% increase in wages in the education system from the 70% increase in the total, which is to be scaled up over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists full acquittal in 2016.
The migrant crisis: A tragedy in the Aegean
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat they were on sank.
Among the victims are 11 women and five children, AFP reports, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was headed for the Greek island of Kos.
The Turkish Coast Guard said it had rescued 249 people on board the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is still unknown.
The previous Monday, two other people died trying to cross the Aegean.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than it could carry, so it was wrecked.
The route has become popular recently for immigrants who want to escape war and the hard life of countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 flight attendants fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 flight attendants and flight attendants for being overweight, the airline announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "sexist", writes The Washington Post.
The mass layoff is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the more crowded flight attendants.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the nine flight attendants who were considered 'exceptionally overweight' on the grounds that this 'may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility required to carry out emergency measures'.
The stewards sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to weaken them have failed", explains a company spokesman.
A star football player teaches Gigi Becali:
A star football player is teaching Gigi Becali about promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy where he had invested a considerable sum, the asshole Paul Papp opened a football school.
Paul Papp Academy will be in Dej City, with the locals waiting for a first selection.
I'm extremely happy that I've reached this stage, to launch the football academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without having to worry about material things in training.
They have to have one concern: to play football as best as possible.
The technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to put their talent to good use.
This is what Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar to make the first selection of the children, to show them that he's with them", football player Papp told dejeanul.ro.
The Academy of the Bottom of the Star is expected to have children up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants to be in government.
The PSD's interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a congressional resolution, we'll do this too.
There's not going to be any emotion about that.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give anyone insecurity in the government or give anyone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to stay in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister", Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
The PSD has announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, sends a clear message whether it wants to continue in government or whether the party decides to move into opposition.
I'll announce Monday if I'm running for Congress.
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position in the future Congress.
I'll sing Monday after the Executive Committee, if the convention date is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party", Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation to announce the candidacy was related to her file, Dragnea said she had no problem with it.
I have no problem with what you're referring to, but I think it's fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce whether or not I'm running at the time the Congress date is formally set.
"It's the only motivation", Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed the PSD extraordinary Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at Bors customs with immigrants hiding in TIR
Two Sri Lankan nationals were tracked Monday at Bors customs as they tried to cross the border illegally, hidden in the half-mast of a carriage wagon driven by an Italian citizen.
The investigation revealed that the two men paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police report.
At the specific checkpoint, border guards noticed a large travel bag in the truck cabin containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a detailed check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered two men hidden in the carmaker's half-box among plastic straps.
The verification showed that the persons concerned were two men, aged 28, Sri Lankan citizens and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In the investigation, the young people stated that they intended to go to France, which they contacted a national, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person", says the Border Police statement.
The two migrants were charged with "criminal offences relating to the fraudulent attempt to cross the state border".
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum motor vehicle registered in Romania, which transported plastic bags for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours, before being presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a motion for a preliminary arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians in a couple: Men versus women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents stated that they were 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of the relationship.
"However, 18% show themselves to be 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in the relationship, and another 18% say 'appropriate'", the study concludes, as shown in a statement sent Tuesday, Ziare.com.
The situation is a little different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% satisfied, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
As regards women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the satisfaction level, we'll notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral status, we see a difference of two percent.
"The same is true in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a 6 percent difference", the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The study authors also report that "Romans feel they need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was carried out by Extreme Training between 1 June and 1 September on 1,369 people, with an estimated margin of error of 2.6%.

What 's going on with coach Darren Cahill ?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not to continue to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician only joining the novelty at major tournaments.
Simona had nothing but words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to compete in front of the whimsical athlete.
But Adidas' program is set to expire at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or to drop out of the partnership.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer", Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, he's asking for a contract worth about a million dollars a year.
Besides, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up right now.
The last race Simona and Cahill will be working on together is the Champions Tour in Singapore.
It wasn't normal. I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca has revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former selector confessed that he had not reached an agreement with FRF President Razvan Burleanu after he replaced Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Eventually, he offered the head of the Federation a substantial raise to keep him, but he was turned down.
I'm not sorry I left the Nationals at this point.
I felt bad then, leaving a job behind.
So I thought then that it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with the people before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he got different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything went very well, and he probably changed his mind, too.
But I wanted to go.
If they wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract extension.
We have about 400 and a few thousand euros a year, we would have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group", Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team did well in Euro 2016 qualifiers.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Border shields and water cannons
Hungarian police detained Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants seeking to enter Serbia despite Hungary having erected a barrier with gimped wire.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes, reports Russia Today.
So far, 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after being thrown over the fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means", said the security adviser to the Hungarian Prime Minister, Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas crowds of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of flooring.
Authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that Serbs have also added their security forces to the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended crossing the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to establish immigrant access.
If on Tuesday he announced that alongside the barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia he would also raise one at the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the erection of a fence at the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was accused by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him drowning, he could barely stand and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he had not drunk, it was evident that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he says, according to the Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he simply didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there".
'It was awful, I couldn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although doubting him for a time, eventually took him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment that put Nick on his mind most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcohol level three times above the legal limit, even though the night before he had only had one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, his body makes all the carbohydrates he consumes ferment, turning them into alcohol.
The one who thought this could be Nick's disease was his wife herself.
The disease has no cure yet, but since he gave up carbs, Nick hasn't had any episodes like this.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of service, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the clip went viral on the Internet, to the delight of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that endangered his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car from didn't solve his problem as he had planned.
The Government approved on Wednesday the 'National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018' and 'The current year action plan', documents considered to be 'another stage in Romania's efforts to modernise the process of managing immigration on national territory', according to a press release.
The source cited shows that the strategy aims at effectively managing the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action reflecting policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States in Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures shall be considered for the united and coherent management of situations caused by the possible influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, caused by political, social, economic or military crisis situations.
"The Romanian authorities will help create a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or who may be at risk of national security", the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the perpetuation and intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
Moreover, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to Romania by third-country nationals who meet labour force employment needs, facilitating access to higher education institutions in Romania by third-country nationals for fields and professions identified as underdeveloped.
The Government considers that the 2015 Action Plan is 'a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon'.
Romania, in the top European labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour cost among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employer personnel expenditure.
In the period from April to June 2015, the total labour cost increased by 1,9% in the European Union and by 1,6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU in labour cost growth
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7,9%), Romania (7,7%), Bulgaria (6,8%), Estonia (5,5%) and Lithuania (4,3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (down 2.9%), Cyprus (down 1.2%) and Italy (down 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour in industry and services by 7,9% and 7,6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania has recorded an increase of 5,8% in the hourly cost of labour.
The report of the TVR management, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks being fired
The Parliament's culture committees rejected Wednesday the Romanian Television Society's Board of Directors' activity report for 2014.
17 MPs voted against the report, one against (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be submitted to the Permanent Bureaux meeting.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be debated.
"I think given this situation it will be done relatively quickly", said Georgica Severin, chair of the Senate Committee on Culture.
He added that it was 'reasonable' for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, as no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was reasonable to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has ever been the victim of a personal attack or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members as early as last night, with about an hour that I didn't know the time, but today, after the meeting of the meeting of the offices, I personally faxed the TVR management inviting her.
I think that the moment you're summoned, you're a budget worker, paid from public fees and you're summoned to a committee meeting even if you don't like it alive.
"Because it's your duty, you're in an institution under Parliament", Severin said after the parliament's Culture Committees meeting.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
Debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would be a day, but they didn't pay off the historical ones.
"I remind you that it was not my fault or anyone else's fault that the banking and taxation entertainment was lost, these are clear management issues", Severin said.
He added that after the activity report was rejected by the meeting of the plenary, elections would follow for a new Board of Directors, which would elect the Director-General of the institution.
I don't know who's going to be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not happen.
It's important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There have to be people who know what's going on there, who have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it's gonna be, if you ask me what qualities it's supposed to have-- common sense in its attitude toward employees because it's a bunch of petitions coming from employees, claims, layoffs.
"When you get such 50, 60, 70 seizures, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that is a disaster", concluded the chairman of the Senate Committee on Culture.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR President-General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament take into account a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In its letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the public television service fee, in order to update the provisions on day-to-day technological changes, as well as to regulate the procedure for checking the payment of the TV fee and for the detection of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
It also wants to issue a provision extending the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of TV tax by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his view, a maximum ceiling of 5% of the fees should be set.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction of the VAT rate on the public television station-specific activities and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to 3% and for an amendment to Law 41/1994, in order to allow budgetary/financial allocations to be made for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sporting events - the World Cup, the Golden Bear, Eurovision.
He argues that the SRTv will be unable to pay in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce judgments, even if they are not final, and payrolls are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce staffing and TV production costs.
'This reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a number of commercial contracts and closed TVR News at the end of July,' the letter to the TVR President reads.
Tanase appreciates that the financial situation is not a problem that can be solved by one's own efforts.
'Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman Television will sooner or later be unable to further its public mission,' the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by prosecutors from the Prosecutor's Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is charged with tax evasion in a case involving damages of approximately 600,000 euros, which is under judicial review.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation showed that, in order to deduct taxes from the state budget, representatives of a company specialising in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fake transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have been made up of fictitious purchases of services that were not actually provided, thereby damaging the state budget by about 600,000 euros", the Roman Police explained in a press release.
The Seeks have determined the fate of Sanmartean
The Al-Ittihad Club's owners have determined the fate of the middle-aged Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, Ladislau Boloni's interior manager, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Bologna is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the starting lineup match and he's doing well.
The Seichi realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give him up.
There was another option to bring in a better player, but nothing came of it.
"There were several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing came to fruition", Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu has been elected Vice President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as the Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were cast in favour and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The representatives of the NLP were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
Moreover, the Liberals have criticized Sarbu's appointment to the post and announced that they will challenge it at the CCR, provided he has a DNA record but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Auditors will not allow him to pursue politics.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority, which has been vacant since Ioan Anton was repealed following a September 2014 Constitutional Court decision finding him unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors:
As Bradley Cooper is about to play a cook in "Burnt", the actor has made an unexpected revelation to his fans.
In a recent interview, he stated that he grew up more in the kitchen: "I've worked as a cook most of my life".
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian origin, so his entire childhood was spent cooking with his Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what plans he had for the future at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map", he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd laugh at if I told you", he said, but his childhood wish has come true.
At 40, the actor admitted that he saw himself in the near future directing, modeling himself on Clint Eastwood, who also directed at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday morning the claims of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that Hungary's political decisions are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other refugee-flight countries".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his temper and, with his irrational claims, he insults the whole of Hungary", the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not speak such uncontrolled slander.
"His comments have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support for Romania's internal policy", the Hungarian diplomat added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behavior of high-ranking Hungarian government officials, who in his opinion "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!" Ponta wrote on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he was in favour of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that brutality and aggressive laws would not solve the problem.
The glib slaughter, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the supremacy of European values - what we are seeing in Hungary these last few days is in total contradiction to these objectives and values!" the Romanian chief executive stressed.
On Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "just lies", saying they were unsuitable for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The Hungarian diplomat also mentioned on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and lying remarks" were related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and always say is that I'm against xenophobic speeches, the idea of closing the borders, that everyone who comes in is terrorists, they're Middle Age fools, and I'm totally against that approach.
If we can get more, we will get more, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not the way our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bat and saddle.
"I disagree with that", the Romanian chief executive said at a news conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to begin preparations in the field for the extension to the Romanian border of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia, to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Prime Minister Victor Ponta later stated that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence does not solve anything about the refugee problem and "scouts Hungary from Europe".
What connection is there between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Makara in Mecca
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, owned by Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a mosque on Friday at the Great Mosque in Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company "did not comply with safety rules", reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation into this case is completed.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former Al-Qaeda terrorist network leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mosque, so it can host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening during a storm when a carriage, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
In the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the protesters up
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after retiring, as a weak coach, unable to perform in his new posture.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, the Stars or Galatasaray, Hagi took over the role of coach at Future Constanta, the team he manages, a year ago.
Exactly a year after taking over the team, the King has demonstrated his ability to turn a team fighting for salvation from relegation into a top team.
So after a year, the future has recorded, with coach Hagi, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 losses.
The pool is one of the top teams, fighting in the European Cup.
Things took a turn for the better for the future this season, as the team finished second in Ligue 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The forward also has the best Ligue 1 goal of all time, with 20 goals (equivalent to Astra), more than twice that of the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought in more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and recently in the starting lineup have appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made Futuro a team to watch for for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer for €1.5 million - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - €1 million) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - €500,000).
Along with the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League One, according to the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played as a small country so far.
It's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated like the seventh EU country.
The major countries are coming up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea pointed out that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and that purely political means will not work in this crisis: "We may have doubts about the quality of the values these people bring".
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we have to adapt to as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Guinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "The Schengen area is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the present situation".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually hasn't solved anything?
It is clear that the President of the European Commission, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the forecasts said he'd have the votes he needed.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the JHA applied the principle of unanimity and any State could block any decision.
Therefore, very little was integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure is followed, where the EC takes the initiative, and the Council approved it with 55% of the votes of the 16 states, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's policy of openness and they didn't want it to appear in many countries as a reaction like "the EU sends migrants to our heads".
They have postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen area and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the Schengen members at the external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
The border of Greece with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants gave the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe he'll give up the Dublin principle that migrants are the responsibility of the first-time state he enters because it's not sustainable.
If Greece is in the way, you can't say forever that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there's still a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European states will take up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It'll probably reach a unique filtering center in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications can be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries with no experience, like Romania, where the migrant problem will increase the xenophobic current.
It's certain that we're talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are living in precarious camps and are just starting to move to Europe.
One estimate says only 10% have made it, winter is hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect a wave next year, maybe even bigger.
What are we gonna do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it as catastrophically from a media standpoint.
Talk about countries with less or more experience.
Do you think there's any place where he's really managed to integrate large groups from a non-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're all enclaves.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, integrating them is more difficult than other migration waves, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
It's an unintegrated part of what's creating major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means will not work.
Creating a fortress in Europe is illusory.
It is necessary to develop the mechanisms for integration into European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
We're going to ask these people to learn the language, try to take on the values, stop standing on one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family together, including through convenient marriage.
But we must separate the imminent problem of these people from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed to integrate in the long run doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come up with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that it's going to take the country overnight and you can take them back.
Until the solutions come, we see fortresses within Europe.
Border closures, walls are being built, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built pretty minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we were running around freely, but we're all in trouble.
In the face of such a wave, it can't be that way, because some countries don't do the face.
When there's this kind of excitement, politicians want to show they're doing something, but in the long run, not much changes.
After the attacks in France, we don't have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion setting in both directions.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of warlike statements from politicians at home under pressure to be manly.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we'll return to the reasons we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is another.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which believes that if you pull the hat on your eyes and stick it in your ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the migrant wave, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country's problem.
We did that, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh EU country.
No, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we're not discussing their quality right now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will decline greatly.
President Iohannis says it's good that we haven't already entered.
So we're moving from desperation to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean that there's a reason not to join Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deporting those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its focus to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two shootings, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks being a great power means getting the Americans and Europeans involved.
From that point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to fall before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years there was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State came up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia may have complicated things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates an outbreak of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you're only great power if you have the solutions.
The game on the off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin's probably waiting for offers, pushing buttons to sort things out.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced he can somehow solve the issues he's created.
But I disagree with theories that these people are being held by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin as more powerful than he is.
What button is coming up soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network's representatives are preparing the opposite, the "Dislike" button.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button would show a shade of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his ad raised the issue that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or an important event in his life and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it's not very comfortable for people to give "like" to current events, like the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving a Like to that post", the Facebook spokesman pointed out.
The new button on Facebook wasn't well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social media", Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
"I'm going to put 'Dislike' on the 'Dislike' button", he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, one hand out of thousands who came in mass at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia over the flow of refugees, closing a major border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different", said the Serbian refugee minister, Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration law was enacted, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" county council seat sits to be picked.
Two manufacturers in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into bankruptcy during the construction.
The county council seat on Vasile Alecsandri Street will eventually collapse on its own.
In a year and a half after the building's consolidation and re-functioning had been completed, the work had not even reached halfway.
A final stage in the building's epic was completed the previous day when the National Council for Resolution of Contests (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract to carry out the technical design for the works that are yet to be executed.
The original design was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, negotiations were opened without publication of a participation notice with Impex Romcatel, the company was to update the technical design and then organise a new auction for the works.
'The negotiations were not concluded by contract, however, and CJ considered that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution,' concluded Răzvan Timofciuc, Public Relations representative at CJ.
The CJ decision to suspend direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as being late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to challenge the decision of the CNSC before the Court of Appeal only after a final judgment has been given and the finding of another designer can be taken into account.
Thus, the building's consolidation work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the technical design should not take long, but we need to get to the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the decision of the CNSC will be challenged or not", Timofciuc said.
The work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chess Bureau began in 2011.
A first contract for the works was terminated in April 2012 after the works had been carried out at a cost of RON 4.5 million.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency and the contract was terminated after payments of RON 1.5 million.
The work has been carried out so far at a rate of about 50%.
Initially, the building's consolidation, re-functionalisation and roofing work had been valued at RON 7.7 million.
"Stop, I'm saying it!" - a statement that could blame the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous Cadastral Office case signed a plea agreement against deferred imprisonment.
His statements will most likely incriminate the other defendants, led by former boss Narcissus Nedelcu.
A counsellor at the Office of Cadastral and Property Advertising (OCPI) in Iași accused of DNA in a corruption case admitted his actions.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Tribunal, with the judges deciding to settle the case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was charged with perjury and agreed to serve two years of suspended prison time and community service.
As regards the facts brought against Dascalu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Office of Cadastre, 'with other colleagues, had falsely drawn up several acceptance documents concerning the service contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I. Iași with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro SRL, SC Agency for Cadastre and Topography SRL and PFA Lipasha Ștefan, which unreally attested that the services contracted were performed in full, provided that they were not performed and not deposited with O.C.P. Iași.'
In the past days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, and other former or current employees of OCPI were also sued in this case, alleging that they were paying services to the companies mentioned, although the work was not carried out.
The damage is over 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of the President of the FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women's national handball team for qualification for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday during a press conference that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that they have to go through two stages of the caudine furnace, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualifying tournament", Dedu added.
We're very eager to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic demands on the part of the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be made up of seven or eight people.
He wants a secondary coach, a doctor, two measurers, a goalkeeper coach, a physical trainer, a delegation chief.
They asked us to get qualified things, specifically physical training materials, that we'd never heard of.
All of this to get to the Olympics. and I'll do everything in my power to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, it's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age of Preparation.
"The teams we are fighting have these materials and have been for some time", Dedu said, noting that they are trying to get the necessary sums to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a hall in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure issue and it's a shame to question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world, Olympic districts were built entirely in a span of two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic zone in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it's become a beautification landmark.
The same thing happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition", Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaetsu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but it became very clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had conversations with EHF, I told them that we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said that they agreed and invited them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we had a concrete discussion.
'So we have all the openness, both at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure,' the FRH official explained.
The former senior handball player avoided assessing the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare reaching the Final Four: "I have requested all coaches to be reserved in forecasts, that if they do not meet they turn against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugby union players make their debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all the components of Romania's lottery are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to get two victories: "We are ready".
Both my colleagues and I are on full throttle engines.
We've been training to give the best result in four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe the joy of participating in the World Cup in words, it's the crowning of so many years of hard work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and we could come home with great results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor", Macovei said.
The Romanian national team selector Lynn Howells, who has first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the national rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are prepared to participate in the tournament.
It's an amazing experience for me.
It is very important to me that at every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident we will be at the heart of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams around the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, it's a bunch of friends, who set out to make their dream come true", Dumitraş said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will progress to Group D, having scheduled the following matches: against France on 23 September in London; against Ireland on 27 September in London; against Canada on 6 October in Leicester; against Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London with the England-Fiji group A match.
New Japanese culture courses organized at Al.I. Cuza University

14 million lei to the hospital "Sant Spiridon" in Iași to rectify the budget
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The hospital 'Sant Spiridon' received from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary correction, about 14 million lei.
The money received by the medical unit to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and renovation of some clinics, as well as in medical equipment and equipment for which the hospital has already begun the procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new CT computer, a new radiology apparatus, six surgical kites, six adequately equipped ATI beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other devices necessary for the medical act.
On the other hand, the hospital's 5 million lei will be used for the construction and renovation of the Great Fire.
From the budgetary adjustment money, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main trunk.
"In addition, in the coming days we will be hosting work from the gateway linking UPU to the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the transportation of the patient from UPU to nearby clinics in decent conditions", the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have a Tatarese dermatology clinic in its courtyard, which it will organise in an outpatient setting, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area of allergy, haematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
The lid, made of laughter by RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Passion of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After all this experience, neither my wife nor I want to ever step foot in your town again.
They accidentally got caught up in the wrong information in the flyers, the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The couple arrived in Iași a few days ago, stayed at a hotel in the centre and asked for tourist flyers.
They also got a flyer that had RATP tracks.
Armed with these maps, the wives visited the Ias.
But two days ago, while in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palais Mall.
Since there was no ticket office at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by text.
No one told them that service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers made their appearance.
They said the service was off for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was canceled.
How do I know what was in the local press, coming in the evening before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two.
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day visiting the police station stand and making statements there!" relates Ovid.
In conclusion, the family was fined for misinformation on the flyer and the controllers who "applied the blood law".
It's not fair, and I made a filing with RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not overreacting to a lot of people, but the point is, I felt cheated.
A genius for the rapists of the Vassla.
They had an accident and were placed under house arrest.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has been moved, since yesterday, to the Court of Appeal of Iași.
The first trial was held in a closed courtroom where seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl demanded their release.
Before the actual beginning of the hearing, one of the outgoing judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, filed a request for a stay, which was granted by his colleagues in the court.
The judge was active until the summer of this year at the Vasslov Tribunal, where he was the head of the Criminal Division, and on 9 April he accepted a challenge by four of the defendants and ordered their arrest at home.
The case is currently being heard by a panel of Magistrates, Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Judge Dan Anton also abstained from the case on the grounds that his daughter was in a concubine relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges have decided that the Vaslui rapists remain in pre-trial detention.
The teenagers will remain in prison for at least 30 more days, when the judges will reconsider their release.
The next hearing will be held at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van carrying the perpetrators from Vasi was involved in an accident in the district of Pucurari, the car entering Iasi on its belt.
The Iveco car carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen car that was leaving Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The dube is circling from the end, Screwball.
The car came into Iasi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from the boat to Iasi on the stables, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the detained escort called another transport to pick up the prisoners.
Shortly afterwards, a car from the Iasi maximum security prison was sent to the scene, which picked up the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, guards surrounded the rear of the cars, and the arrested escaped in a hurry, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles had a friendly understanding about the damages to be paid", said Chief Commissioner Madalín Tarranu, IPJ.
The Great Migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what follows.
What about Europe?
I say it from the outset, clearly and emphatically: the 7,000 refugees Romania should and should naturalize are, in themselves, a small number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions expressed in solidarity with the European Union in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants are to really accept to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Paralyzed by the entanglement and paralyzed by a venomous political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, to build modern roads, kindergartens or schools, to provide decent health care, to clean up the street mess, to create decent paid jobs, or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they're fleeing from?
But what is particularly surprising is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We first hit the bellicose hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept each other - of another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably for fear of someone stealing his national being.
Finally, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, while only invoking the horrors of war as a reason to leave, do not accept any other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and there's no war in Pakistan.
The simplistic way the crisis is analyzed can also be taken for granted.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, strictly on the books of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an unstable, divided and overcome structure.
I was complaining that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but here the EU has no future plan either.
And improvisation and threats are no good.
What good is the EU, then, if the only advantage that the Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be challenged by the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what comes next.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
The destination practically imposed
The concession tender shall be for a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The building has a useful surface of 134 sq.m. on two levels of grass.
CJ accepts as the building's intended destinations only those of a literary café, library or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at EUR 68,300, with the initial bidding price being EUR 6,830 per annum, with a bidding rate of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and permanently and fully cover the costs of rehabilitating the property, in accordance with the technical design to be drawn up.
'The Pogor Club building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period when the public power plant was in operation in these premises and even after its evacuation no current repair and maintenance work was carried out as is currently necessary during the operation of a building', the tendering documentation states.
The club's bidding is expected by 18 September.
Two brothers from Tomeşti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two nine-year-old boys, 11 years old brothers from Tomeşti, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on treatment, and the medication wasn't hidden.
The children were rushed to St. Mary's Hospital in Iași.
They're in stable condition, as the doctors say.
A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years old, he received a brave gift: biological parents.
Lost in hospital in obscure conditions in the dark of the '90s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young Isis, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited the other day in Iaşi with her biological parents from a county village, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old on this day, and her Palermo adoptive parents have decided to give their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iasi, to learn about her unclear past.
The Iasi newspaper, which witnessed the efforts of the family's search for a few extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the Ishe town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to a hospital in the city.
At home, disagreements between parents began, and my mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me away.
He stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late", recalls mourningly Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Paschany, and at the same time the girl's father, Costicá Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be broken up forever.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After his internment, Crina's father went to work in another town, and came back after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it was almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She would have thought she was abandoned", says one of the family's nieces.
Due to financial problems, Grandma could not bring Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate General of Social Welfare and Child Protection, which then turned her over to the Bucium Placement Center for care.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more lightly regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted their child but couldn't.
They fell in love instead with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl was almost two years old when the adoption formalities took place.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our daughter.
"As if my wife had given him life", says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling as he grabs the girl's hands in his palm.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costic, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but they received no answer where his child might be.
The police then informed her that she may have died, but at Iaşi's parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was away in Italy, in Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I never had.
We prayed to God that she was okay.
I've been thinking about her all these years, but there's been no way to walk around, to find her.
"It's hard", says Crina's biological mother with tears in her eyes.
Yet, even as the years passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvador and his wife explained to the girl where he came from and that her past linked her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania", confesses Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March this year, Chief Commissioner Roma Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Advice Iași, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy who explained to him Salvador's desire to find Crina's biological family.
And the searches started with just one name.
After the request of our Italian partners, we started the first steps.
We only got one name, the Costic Balkans, then the location, the Ruginoosa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there was a locality named after it.
Then they gave me some clues, only the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took us about a month to finally find the girl's biological father", explains Chief Roman Commissioner Ichim.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costicá and Alina, especially since they each had their homes in a different town.
We started the process somewhere in March, and in June-July we finished identifying the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we arranged for a first meeting to take place in September", Romania Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costicà saw their lost daughter for the first time in the halls of the hospital in Iași, 20 years ago.
Father, moved, could hardly hold back his tears, and his hands trembled continually.
He barely exchanged a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years is something", says a granddaughter, who also brought Costic from Ruginoosa.
Crina's meeting with her mother and biological brother
In conversations with his daughter, who was about to study at a well-known university in Italy, Costicà Balcan told her, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to his village, she could come quietly: she could give him something, sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and start a household.
My mother is also excited, crying, and hardly believes that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought that could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking about it all these years, I've been hoping, but I never thought I could be like this.
There's a lot of emotion.
If you could just forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond", says Alina, Crina's mother, tearfully on her cheeks, holding a napkin in her hand.
In him she still hides her tears of happiness, because soon she will see her face after so bitter a time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be 20 this month, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to put his mind together, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me after all.
It's going to be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a good memory with them, because now there are so many things to say", confesses Crina.
First family reunion in Iaşi
In the Unity Square, under the early autumn sky, the Ruginoasa family reunite their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she's graduating from high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It no longer divides borders or countries, but only a barrier: the language barrier.
Through which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of a place in the center of the Iasi, they passed easily.
Those who made this meeting possible say it's the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It's the first event of its kind organized, with such emotional load, and I'm glad to be a success.
We at the Center have a variety of activities, and most of the time we're associated as an institution that only deals with people who use drugs, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give back to society something good.
"If I'm asked to attend another such event, I'll do it with great affection", says Romika Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Advice in Iași, smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, move away with stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
The ceasefire on foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their breath
The camps of the PSD's Isheian branch have concluded a ceasefire with their arms on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party office.
Far from being over, the party's civil war seems to have taken just a break to allow the fighters to pull their souls together.
The dragon has not given an ultimatum.
He's sent a very simple and very current message in the current circumstances: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who wish to.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure", said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the post of president of the PSD district branch.
The short list of possible candidates for the main position in the party's Isheian branch includes Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazăr, County Councillor Vasile Catea and the Interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the commune of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, may also join them.
One option is the candidacy of PSD County Council leader Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer run, party sources saying he is not interested in the position.
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidates can be submitted, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"The important thing is that we stay united, and we will remain after October 3 when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new management structures", the Committee said.
Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the PSD district branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, with the preparation of the elections to be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu said the discussions over the past few days have led to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a united team to handle the county.
"On the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions of the candidate for the presidency of PSD Iași, the list remains open", Stanciu commented.
A Yiddish judge has rejected the case of Vaslui rapists on the grounds of concubine
The seven young men from Vaslu County convicted of rape are arriving today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Vaslui sentenced to five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today after the court of first instance, the Vaslui Court, has decided to imprison them immediately after the sentence is delivered.
The case was filed in the Court of Appeals late last week, with Judge Dan Anton filing a stay, which his colleagues agreed to.
Anton claimed that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silvius Ovidius Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How the Judges Reasoned the Judgment
Late last week, the judge at the Ship Court who convicted the seven young men justified the sentence.
In the plea, the judge refers to the defiant reaction of the defendants and their supporters, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
'The Court notes that after the time of the placing under preventive judicial control, a restrictive but not depriving measure of liberty, under the influence of the attitude of the accused, their families and their local supporters, there was a strong sense of indignation at the level of the local and national community over the fact that persons accused of serious offences are tried under a less restrictive measure,' the Vassla Court's reasoning states.
The magistrates also dismissed the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial claimed that the girl they raped was not a "church door".
'The court underlines that the moral quality of the victim is irrelevant, an aspect which the defendants wanted to highlight in their defenses, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext,' the statement of reasons states.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they enjoyed over the past decades may not continue in the years ahead.
By Saturday probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder how much it can affect us to choose a politician who is not in a position to make decisions.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the war.
A self-proclaimed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he at one point asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by Russia Today), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost the United States' favorite.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the kind Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he got into the real world and the economic legends.
The new Labour leader's economic programme includes, among other things, massive renationalizations and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some may wonder why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted globally, we would then have global general prosperity!
Sure, we can tax the blood of bankers, become a sort of left-wing service enemy, but as has been seen so many times in the past, not just in the former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's terms.
The additional sums are quickly swallowed up by generous, unshrouded promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher famously pointed out, "the problem with socialism is that at some point, other people run out of money".
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in beliefs as the new party leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a relatively consistent and structured working class in the classic sense of the word in Britain.
And the unions were much more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the overall workforce and extensive automation has made industry massively in need of highly skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide to leave the Union after the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep failures created within it by the euro crisis and therefore the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
Moreover, for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming increasingly the dominant player anyway).
It's true, the British business community, City, are strong advocates of the country staying in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the Europe of the past.
There's a lot of resentment, which is growing in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as we had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech recently, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening as electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration and eurosceptic groups is rising dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative charges has reached higher levels than ever before.
So where does the Financial Times come to when it assesses the chances of Brexit?
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that is based on national interest.
If the voters make the decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are fueling their populist rhetoric from the frustrations that have accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they enjoyed over the past decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the political ambitions of integration, and not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, turmoil on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may greatly affect the situation in Romania.
And it's hard to rule out anything in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantine the Brunch, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
"Take and wipe the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be somebody, to become famous, to be heard about in the world.
But behind his reputation is something almost forgotten today, when we are given millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "trudue".
What to write about Constantine Brancusi?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure was on the bills.
And recently, a famous Romanian bank hired an actor to play him in a commercial.
Brunchusi has been producing and delivering money for almost 60 years since he's gone.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards named after him.
Besides, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with his adult, he hears these instructions: "Let's go to the park, to the Brunch".
The country is surrounded by his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capability is enormous.
Even the Communists failed to erase him from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are now spreading the Internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would there be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, it's these people who tell you that if you're not lucky enough to be born into a big city and into a family as wealthy as you are, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here's a key.
Maybe that's where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Look at the stupid success stories that are delivered to you every day in the newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
You want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, of him an entire world has heard?
It's a simple thing.
He's worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Pestișani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși led a modest life, but one from which he would gather the milestones that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Touțea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have led a happy, patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
Brâncuși's childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments of these early years is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the book "Branchos. A Biography", by Alexander Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, while the "cazan" was being made, watching the liquids tasters to see if the process was going well, Brâncuși caught a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palm sock with a little bit of tin and drinks the unbreathed.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people don't notice until after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then becomes hysterical, thinking her son is dead.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard with his singers, he sees in the distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their hearts set on their feet.
The party immediately turns to mourning.
Dad's already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brinduša, the scentmaker and servant of the Brunchos.
The brake checks the baby's breathing, then puts a horse's claw under his nose, gathered from around.
The baby is crawling hard.
The people applaud.
While the boy is allowed to continue his drunken, joyful sleep, the roaring party continues with even greater force.
The next day, father and son meet in the meadow.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine gather some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his child down with his head and, with the young boy's nails, beats him to remember.
And while feeling the numbness of the blows, little Brown bear has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in old age, if the star itself was not involved in his disorder.
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father by what had happened to him?
At this time, the city is not functioning
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuţ called on the PSD and the PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big divide and that's it.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects since 2012 continue.
Neither highway nor Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see politicians contesting their possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside a little bit, get together and talk.
At this time, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with the civil war, you don't have time for those who chose you", Blade said.
He noted that the current political class had disrupted the Ieshi electorate, resulting in a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the loyal electorate of the parties.
The deputy also believes that voters will also be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the party "For the Left" which will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic activists, who are usually right-wing.
"It's breaking even more right, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD", said Blunt.
He stated that he was not interested in running in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for mayor.
I said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still thinking about whether to continue as a deputy in my next term.
I tried to call for unity for the Iasi and in the hallways discussions with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything", Blăjuț said, who said the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electorate.
A colleague in Tatarashi said he can't afford the money and he has to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
It's not a small amount of money.
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to pick up the cash from the cash register.
At the end of my term, I'll report everything I've spent, except the salaries of the staff at the firm and its maintenance.
I happened to raise 30,000 lei in one month, with all the bills for transportation, accommodation and everything else.
"To tell a parliamentarian that he doesn't have enough money is pure hypocrisy", Blăjuț concluded.
