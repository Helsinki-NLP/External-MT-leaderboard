Accumulated incidence of rapidly increasing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease cases shows similar trends in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the UK, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients that will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomeration of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been termed coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 percent develop a critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the COVID-19 case counts reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed that of Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited similar upward trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that, as of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in which countries are located, the variations in national public health responses and, possibly, the different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients who must undergo testing to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10 percent of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data is not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study in 201011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100 000 inhabitants in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 201011).
Model scenarios for healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90% of improvement in intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid COVID-19 risk assessment.
Since so far case conglomerates have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of territorial statistical units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response in a consistent manner if not implemented ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed 3000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, which generated a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this analysis will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unheard-of and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; that's why, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number 1 and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarise the progress in research on this rapidly developing new subject.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronavirus have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we've encountered two highly pathogenic human coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China in 2003, and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a staggering morbidity and mortality.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the infection was reported from health care providers, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the source of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and to almost 50 more countries worldwide (fig. 2).2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the size and final severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected people were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 spread in conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) passed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and the adjusted R0 was 2,23-4,82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spike (S) glycoprotein in the envelope binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 percent in 10 sequentially sampled samples taken from the original outbreak site: Wuhan's Huanan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is congruent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 electron cryomicroscopy structure at resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the carrier amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate guest
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to two SARS-like bat-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains unclear how it could be transmitted.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-snout mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference spread across the totality of two genomes remains a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidin, are effective at deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only use previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Cooperating T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an over-reaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate occurrence, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large amount of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time to the most precise incubation period, so as to prevent asymptomatic infected people from passing the virus on to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study from late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98 percent for fever, 76 percent for dry cough, 55 percent for dysnea and 3 percent for diarrhea; 8 percent of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent) and dysnea (55 percent) as major symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them required respiratory assistance, far more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the higher lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory support was needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2 percent when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality rate for November 2002 was 10 percent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and rose to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients within the two weeks prior to the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can get the virus again, a warning sign that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase were observed in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Abnormalities are detected in the chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or opacity in bilateral glazed glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, which reduces the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings on chest x-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitium, and multinucleated sincilia cells in the lungs of a patient who died due to the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which were no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graded rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if tested in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table (table 2).2).
These therapies include treatments currently or potentially in use with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as those in the digestive tract and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are T cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF blockage; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses for a short period of time has been recommended for patients with critical COVID-19.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, given intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been proven.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is high expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
Blood extraction from patients recovering from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and they recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Her symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in her blood.
However, this needs to be verified and clarified in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine-release syndrome, possibly resulting in deadly toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to theories of MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for treating COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment only to combined MO and MCT treatment.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance and hospitalization was significantly less in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO+MCT group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO+MCT group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of MCT remain to be expected for further well-controlled trials at larger scales and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects such as corticosteroid insomnia, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic arousal, psychotic symptoms, delusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people with suspicion and people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to prevent close contact between people.
They are essential effective vaccines to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and they often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with attenuated live viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before a clinical study can be initiated.
This is probably because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
However, there are still sporadic cases and MERS conglomerates in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) needed for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without consequences.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease forecasting model is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (table (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7 percent of those patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably older than those who did not (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of reactive C protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation between PCR level and severity and COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict patient development.
These enzymes are strongly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They are therefore traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest x-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, as with other common cold-causing coronavirus.
Therefore, patients infected in the early or incubation phase can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while transmission was mostly not in the early stages.
So the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the downward phase will last for 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal and pharynx exudate in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the recently identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, strict quarantine and isolation have managed to control the disease.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectiousness and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the stool, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Precautions should therefore be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passersby who come into contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or adhering to surfaces from which they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation from virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear custom insulation suits to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; it is possible that the virus entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective face masks or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered a sufficient distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly eased the public's alarm, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, and missed the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical information, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive in containing a possible early-stage epidemic, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing tailored and effective drills to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to periodically test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the sensation of SARS reappearing.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 percent versus 1.44 percent).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not show symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronavirus, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively stop transmission, and the outbreak can resurface at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it go extinct like SARS or will it periodically resurface like the flu?
While it may take time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and get back to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus and its hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronavirus were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the currency by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronavirus in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be helpful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronavirus have their origin in bats, which are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir guests of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for disease prevention in humans.
Researching interactions between coronavirus and guests on animals could also yield important information about the human coronavirus pathogenesis.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronavirus, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and species-to-species transmission.
Notably, we compare and contrast different human coronavirus from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
The coronavirus belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped, positive monocatenary RNA viruses.
These viruses, which contain the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called coronavirus because of their morphology, because of the shape of the corona they have under an electronic microscope.
As for their structure, coronavirus have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab replicase.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of ancillary proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, the coronavirus are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronavirus contains most human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively large number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion from common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating in modern history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude fatality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronavirus have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronavirus in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogenic, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of species-to-species jump.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for preventing further spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, species-to-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlighted and analyzed the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are normally not pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examined the trend of human coronavirus evolution, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last decades, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and, subsequently, adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial transmission in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a sickness period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypic pneumonia, caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dysnea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal outcomes in laboratory tests for SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research into human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coriander, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with its peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory illnesses.
These four human-acquired coronavirus have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown causes, such as in the infrequent case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused severe lower respiratory infection in China.
Generally, when these human coronavirus acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases imported with occasional contagion to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far is only the case with MERS among human coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were recorded, with a high mortality of 34,4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to man.
From mid- to late December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which retrospectively were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and, furthermore, named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90 053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a crude fatality of 3.4%.
Notably, the mortality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2 percent, while the mortality rate outside is 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronavirus (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most often seen in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly smaller.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronavirus and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronavirus.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing between humans, as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, still needs to be clarified in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human-acquired coronavirus in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passes, will have an influence on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human-acquired coronavirus communities that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronavirus from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases from human coronavirus have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If adapted well, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronavirus acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to be kept and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four community-acquired human coronavirus.
It's highly transmissible like the human coronavirus acquired in the community, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronavirus and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of human coronavirus' evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir guest hosts a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests become naturally infected and are natural guests of human coronavirus or its parent virus.
However, if human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the function of an amplifier host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronavirus can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir guest.
Epidemiological data revealed in retrospect that the initial case of SARS had had contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence research indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Civetas of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palm trees or farms without exposure to live animal markets mostly gave negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of masked palm trees would only act as an amplifier intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate hosts amplifying SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3, which exists in Chinese bat rodents.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronavirus share an 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a bat fecal sample was shown to use ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, the serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences phylogenetically approach their betacoronavirus counterparts from bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive in MERS-CoV specifically neutralizing antibodies, as are camels native to the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting the camels acting as bona fide MERS-CoV reservoir guests.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only through respiratory tract but also through fecal-oral pathways, which is also the primary route of bat virus spread.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of camel contact before symptoms occurred, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from bats Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the near-identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts should be among wild species sold and killed at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share an 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublines of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported detection of viral contagion in lung samples, which are also found to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different methods of manual assembly and curing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the pangolin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronavirus.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronavirus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin beta-coronavirus RBDs is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal advocates a recombination between betacoronavirus pangolin related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronavirus.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat coronavirus named ARCoV.2 (Apalachian Mountain Coronavirus) detected in a tricolor bat from North America had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camellids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge available so far about the animal origins of known human coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-species coronavirus transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not as accurately known.
Bat alphacoronavirus has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha coronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus directly to humans.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may acquire the HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
So it wouldn't be too surprising if bats transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronavirus acts as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, specifically in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of species-to-species transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a large number of species of viruses, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It's well suited to these camels, who have gone from being an intermediate guest to being a stable, natural reservoir guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronavirus is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronavirus, as are civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans, should be confirmed or dismissed in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans get the virus through killing and eating game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study in domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned earlier, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating the coronavirus crossing species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monochain RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronavirus could be considered moderate to high, with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of coronavirus to new guests.
Coronavirus have a reading-checking exorribonuclease, the removal of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, remdesivir's nucleotide analogue is known to suppress the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the coronavirus are about a million times higher than those of its guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronavirus is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It's hoped that it's already adapted to another human-near host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Second, the long RNA genome of the coronavirus exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the likelihood of coevolution between species, which favors the emergence of new coronavirus when the right conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique copy-like open reading frames and functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronavirus randomly and frequently change templates during RNA replication through a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during coronavirus RNA transcription.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs could be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
Phyllogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing species-to-species transmission.
Currently, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, SARS-CoV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensively selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoons, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes could be fundamental to the virus's adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the S protein binding affinity with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study points to a 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this link compared to that of human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl sialtic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus to humans, after species-to-species transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of human-to-species transmission of coronavirus is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural coronavirus reservoir hosts from humans, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronavirus must usurp the host dependence factors and subvert the host restriction factors for species-to-species transmission to be successful.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome investigation of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
New human coronavirus: we start from scratch
The diversity of bats' coronavirus provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronavirus.
In this sense, bat coronavirus acts as the genetic repository of human coronavirus.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronavirus and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV ancillary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
Elimination of 29 SARS-CoV characteristic nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible recombination history with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA were identified.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to have experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronavirus, in which human coronavirus recombine with other animal coronavirus in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting in the release of viruses from selection pressures, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 was observed in bats and camels viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a change in frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also driven by the selection pressure on its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating the mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to coronavirus anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activating the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer NKG2/CD94 cells and the low expression level of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect the reading checking of exorribonuclease, which brings the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the past two decades.
Coronavirus are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is the root of the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response disengagement strategy could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory enzyme in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus of bats has been found that shares a 95 percent nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96 percent nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that market civets and other animals host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronavirus have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin betacoronavirus could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or accidentally.
Coronavirus have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronavirus in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from human-civette contact in markets, closing wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several betacoronavirus strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be delineated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures, should be adopted.
Since we're not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus, they're circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity arises to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunities for humans to contact bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if populations are educated to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and its natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of infection with the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guidance included our experience and is a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for suspect case and confirmed case according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be met if no clear epidemiological background is available:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any pathogenic or serological test characteristics as follows: (1) real-time positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase in title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for detecting nucleic acid in blood or respiratory samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, serological testing was added to the seventh edition.
I'm not sure.
Moreover, more and more evidence is reminding us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated as the person without clinical symptoms was classified as low risk.
The scoring system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that you seek and comply with the latest guidelines in your home countries.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number in a single day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in a single day yesterday.
That's the most deaths in a day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60 and one between 41 and 50.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first reported cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, involving two men who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases yesterday, including 79 332 cases in the 24 hours before 10:00 a.m. central European time (UTC-0800) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's closure until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their limits on purchasing toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets across the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of one package.
These restrictions were posted as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
According to reports, consumers were getting supplies out of fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package per order.
These changes were introduced following the previous four-package transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the four-pack restriction in place, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery", and said the demand "had no precedent", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales rose "strongly" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a planned Wednesday special offer in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low number of stocks in numbers, and when it runs out, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, intensifying the sense of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there was an abundance of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be [bought] and there were large quantities, panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to keep the supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at the Melbourne auctions, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page envelope designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-reel packages.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general.
We are very concerned, both about alarming levels of spread and gravity, and alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has no precedent".
In statements published by CNN in February he stated, "apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time", he added.
The new pandemic condition arises after the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case-by-case mortality rate was estimated at 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy, and recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and controlling and self-isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused a serious global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus was spread over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of the virus.
The reduction in travel and heavy industry closures led to a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases were mostly related to the wholesale market for Huanan seafood, therefore the virus was thought to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bats coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person known to have symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last wet market group.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established a market link between the two types of aid.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province, may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in China but increased suddenly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had, for the first time, exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4 percent of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60 percent of the British population would have to become infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 testing, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, in China, up to January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refer to people who passed the COVID test positive, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without having been tested may not be included, for example, in their homes, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimation", a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics, such as age, sex and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate over cases is 6.0 percent (97,039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths over cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other indicators include the case-by-case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from disease, and the infection fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from disease.
These statistics do not have a specific time limit and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall mortality rate from pandemic infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on case-by-case fatality rate estimates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, "Infectious outbreaks, if left unchecked, usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease becomes unavailable.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen".
China's top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it "could be over by June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to a study by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, given its ease of transmission, will completely disappear" and "could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the airways (phlema), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent pressure or chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish color on the face or lips; upon manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, presenting no clinical symptoms, although test results confirm infection, so researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44 percent.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) spans one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to spread mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is considered to be a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies show that when you cough without covering your mouth, droplets can move from 15 feet (4.5 m) to 27 feet (8.2 m).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Breathing droplets can also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although, usually, the virus is not transmitted through the air.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolisation of respiratory secretions and therefore airborne spread.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few lab-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature-related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
It's thought to have zoonotic origins.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96 percent identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the complete genome comparison indicated that the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share, at most, 92 percent of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by imaging using CT scans.
According to a study in Wuhan that compared the polymerase chain reaction with CT, CT is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, though less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using CT scans as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed with a nasopharynx, although a throat swab can also be used.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been shown to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the USA, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and CT images of symptomatic individuals include asymmetrical peripheral opacity in glazed glass and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of results obtained from confirmed case images.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging diagnosis by chain reaction of polymerase has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT scans of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in the epidemic-affected areas.
Convoltional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable towel and throwing the towel directly into a garbage can.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to and from the countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the Community spread stage in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members don't know where or how they got infected. It is recommended that healthcare providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and wear eye protection.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-respecting solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. They are circulating erroneous ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwash gargling are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which breaks down its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 6271%, isopropanol at 50100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5%, and iodized povidone at 0,27,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an facility, such as an office or daycare center, disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by the sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with their elbows bent or with a disposable towel to cough or sneez, and that they immediately dispose of the towel.
Those who may be infected are advised to wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the breathing droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene".
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the public to wear masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using fabric-made non-medical masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend that people make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out into public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask when in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded that all people entering a supermarket wear masks.
Israel has requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been manufacturing ten million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses.
Panama has imposed the mandatory use of masks for outdoor activities, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks for those who cannot afford them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum meeting size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of suffering from serious illnesses and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay at home as much as possible in the community areas affected by the outbreak.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had repercussions on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means.
They include recommendations that you only have sex with a person you live with, who has neither the virus nor symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health bodies have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation.Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
Stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer controllable, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be adopted at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; Community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass attendance events; the Community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental and surface cleaning measures. In China, more drastic measures aimed at containing the outbreak were taken once its gravity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented mass screening and localized quarantine assessments, and issued alerts about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which slows the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it must be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise transmission reactivates quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing existing medicines.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, you may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance.
Steroid use can make the results worse.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response measure to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care services to redistribute resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling opt-in procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case (called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, of spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO.
By early January, enough cases of unknown-cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to start an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and an important railway junction.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data shows that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, in-place shelter orders or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 million people are confined in India.
By March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of confinement, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later, about a third of the world's population.

The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from home whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.

WHO noted the difference between the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic on the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while "it was definitely not a recommendation that WHO has made", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems".

On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "which do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, should they do".
Tedros also made statements in which he affirmed that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future".
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to contribute "the power of the entire UN system in response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can contribute their expertise to address the social, economic and wider development consequences of the outbreak".

This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared", insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that "basically we are accepting that all humans on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The director-general said WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".

Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, have dismissed an earlier acknowledgement of the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US Donald Trump administration has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and claimed that "China's censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, was noted by some critics as racism and "distraction from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a US Government telegram describing a communications strategy apparently originating in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "All About China".

The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.

He blamed the outbreak of coronavirus on several cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased use worldwide of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions to logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which caused shortages of supplies.
The technology sector in particular has been warning about delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful and prevented a severe food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a considerable reduction, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, including in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.

The impact on the cruise industry reached an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.

Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.

Hong Kong raised its response to the infectious disease to a high and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 percent drop.
This also led to a 33 to 43 per cent drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than would have been the case without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to a survey by the Angus Reid Institute, 44 percent of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German short-term workers' compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had repercussions on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Organisations in the culture and arts sector tried to fulfill their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, show venues and other cultural institutions worldwide had been closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, major efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly rapid consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Lent penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live Internet or television, while others offered spaces for prayer from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 201920, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 201920 season and the NHL 201920 season.
The outbreak disrupted the plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "be rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or canceled.
This led to many gamblers turning to the Internet, many online gambling sites reported significant increases in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many big theaters, like Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live broadcasts of concerts or creating "festivals" on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous internet memes about the coronavirus have been circulated, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserve the virus or that they are receiving what they consider a just retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both online and offline.
Following the outbreak's advance to new countries where the situation is critical, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
Chinese, along with other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported higher levels of racist insults, in addition to aggression.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and destined for "waste".
Many newspapers with paid walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers published scientific articles related to the outbreak available to open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory disease for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate for the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with reverse real-time transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hyssopates or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing with pharyngeal hypopads is only reliable in the first week of disease.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airway by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reverse transcriptase-in-real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymerase chain reaction.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its reverse-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel with transcriptase for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health labs through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic testing in previous versions of test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a clogging of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only after that was it allowed for state and local laboratories to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability nationwide of COVID-19 tests based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made testing for COVID-19 available nationally.
No quantity limits were announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Care Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed, hoping it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "torture x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
Typical characteristics in TC include bilateral multilobar opacities in glass cast with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, pattern in stencillation and consolidation develops.
According to a study in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared with CT, CT is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using CT scans as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends polymerase chain reaction as an initial test.
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and to monitor the population.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For central laboratory analyses, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
For testing at the spot, a single blood sample is usually obtained by a skin puncture.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed prior to analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction testing.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection begins.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody testing kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for a specimen", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result in no time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspected cases in their homes, eliminating the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Physicians with Statutory Health Insurance said on March 2 that it had a capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that 10,700 people had been tested the week before.
Health insurance covers the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany has a general capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, tests were being offered using the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, as of the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed in total, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples from 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive.
With construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled without this capacity to conduct testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplex designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow evaluating up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient quantities of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to do more testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and the purchase of a population-level mass production laboratory by Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its Huo-Yan Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside of China.
Different test formulas were developed to address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying testing available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
Experts say the large availability of South Korean tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government has achieved its ability to conduct tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization requested increased testing programs as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of testing delays in private U.S. laboratories, and supplies of hyssopates and chemical reagents ran out.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that dropped incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use".
The testing, supplemented by quarantine of those who obtained positive results and identification of those with whom they had had contact who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of testing across the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With the travel restrictions in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28 Singapore began recommending residents to stay home, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done more testing, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column Positive as % of tests is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people who enter hospitals will have a higher positive number as a percentage of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing your hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constantly washing hands with soap at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have soap or water, you can wash your hands with ash.
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who used the bathroom.
After a nose ring, cough or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in the height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Handwashing-encouraging interventions can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as an automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can cause itchy skin conditions that cause skin to become scaly, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
Too often washing hands is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-facial transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom ( urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing is needed to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was close to half at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavior change, to increase adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a tailored action to promote children's health and education.
Getting rid of parasites twice a year, besides washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, since the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve hand use is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been intensively promoted for a health-conscious public.
There is currently no evidence to show that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and protective skin agent, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as a pH regulator, antimicrobial-activated benzoic acid and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Nice hot water to wash your hands with is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents with no water and alcohol to rub (also known as alcohol-based hand solution to rub, antiseptic hand solution to rub or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as a carbomere (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the dryness effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively remove germs.
Disinfectants for rubbing alcohol remove bacteria, bacteria resistant to various medicines (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants with alcohol for rubbing containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand sanitizers to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid activity in the elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap or water is available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may dry out the skin, unless skin emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The dryness effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand rub solutions are very rare.
The lower incidence of irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and formula, and historically has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rubbing solutions.
More recently, it has been shown that formulas using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ashes or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with standing water can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
Stretching creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and stretching for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinsing in a container can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated, and the parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and unshelled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizer lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economical options can be used to facilitate hand washing when running water or soap is not available, for example pouring water from a hanging bucket or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home faucets" and other economical options.
A homemade faucet is a simple technology that involves using a suspended jar of rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying their hands with the hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase, on average, by 194 percent in the fingertips and 254 percent in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria by 42 percent in the fingertips and 15 percent in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76 percent in the fingertips and 77 percent in the palms.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, as claimed, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow microorganisms from the hands and unit and, potentially, contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the bacterial count were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer towels is an alternative when you're traveling, when you don't have soap or water.
The hand sanitizer with alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Doctors' hand washing became compulsory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and tighten all parts of their hands.
Hands should be tightened together by intertwining the fingers.
If there are debris under the nails, a brush brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in water on your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated by those surfaces again.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses habitually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing standard hand washing and hand rubbing in health care.
The preliminary version of the organisation's Hand Hygiene Guide can also be found on its website for the public to comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has five times to wash your hands:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
Before an aseptic job and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (medicinal or antibacterial soaps) gives you the possibility of removing the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, you need a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized scrubbing brush and another sterilized tool to clean under your nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
Washing is not necessary for long periods of time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after you treat sick people.
In controlling staph infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand cleaning has been found to be in the first 20% of washing and very little additional benefit is obtained when hand hygiene frequency increases by more than 35%.
Common soap washing results in more than three times the incidence of foodborne bacterial infections compared to antibacterial soap washing. When comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution to hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol rubbing reduced bacterial contamination by 26 percent more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile hand spores than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities may include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, soap hand washing is considered an economical and fundamental tool for good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are economical options for building hand washing stations.
However, low rates of handwashing can also be the result of entrenched habits and not a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a change in behaviour in the population in the long term.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF 'Three Star' approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing promotion campaigns being carried out to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-2020 and UNICEF has launched an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of handwashing in developing countries relative to avoided AVADs.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing to human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as new mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the Englishwoman, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic made many countries more aware of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, signs with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung next to the toilets of public toilets and the toilets of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "wash your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take over something or share in complicity with something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of much broader use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and which had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after recalling or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing items more.
In addition, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Symbolic hand washing, with water but without soap, is part of ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Bahá'í, Hindu, Tevila and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing-room in Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hygienic hand washing, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force washing hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Shia, Judaism and Islam all require washing hands before and after every meal.
Risk controls in the workplace in the face of COVID-19
The workplace risk controls for COVID-19 relate to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work task and are based on an assessment of risk from exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and risk factors for workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and coworkers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including handwashing, advising workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing hygiene standards, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work with a medium exposure risk includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, highly concentrated work environments and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protection equipment available in case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people known or suspected of having COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people known or suspected of having COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have a number of consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, have to care for others or are afraid of exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are sought and in terms of the means by which those goods are purchased (such as buying at non-peak times, via home delivery services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and individual worker risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing transmission between staff, protecting those at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining commercial operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework in occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, lastly, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed accordingly (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, checked frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal work contact with the public and coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, advising workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing hygiene rules including covering themselves when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and waste containers, preparing for remote work or step-by-step shifts if necessary, dissuading workers from using tools and equipment from others, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a key measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they stop having fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know about these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have contracted SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission around the company's location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
Administrative controls for this group and some large retail sales environments include recommending that sick workers stay at home, replacing meeting rooms with virtual communications, setting up ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers and placing a window for the care service so that the customer can ask from the car. These include recommending that sick workers stay at home, replacing virtual communication rooms with virtual communication rooms, setting up handstands that do not have a place to protect their hands from COVID-19, and providing a combination of safety measures such as preventing and protecting workers from COVID-19 and other safety measures, including protecting workers from the spread of COVID-19, protecting their hands and protecting their hands, protecting their hands against the spread of COVID-19, and providing for the use of equipment and other resources that are in place to prevent and prevent COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, promising to use equipment and equipment that are in place to prevent and prevent COVID-19, and promising to use equipment and equipment that are in place to prevent and prevent COVID-19, and promising to provide a minimum level of safety for workers and other workers' safety, including measures to prevent and prevent COVID-19 and other risky factors such as the use of personal protective equipment and protective equipment that are in place of workers's workplace.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person, or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper towels when he coughs or sneezes.
Cabin crew must wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a hazardous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.In the case of commercial shipping, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing travel due to illness, self-isolation and immediately informing the on-board medical centre if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical checks should be done in the isolationist's cabin, and in the case of schools and child care centers, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical education or choir classes or dining in the dining room, increasing the space between the desks, scaled-up entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the cancellation of classes may be considered to be extended.For police force personnel who conduct routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers are advised to contact people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 and follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with a household cleaner before re-using them and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in preparing the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; these people become very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and morgues.
Samples shall be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those people who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or higher filter mask N95 respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory program that includes adjustment testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for entry patient classification staff.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, provide care or transport them without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, eyeglasses or facial protectors, coats and gloves.
If aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the permission to enter a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those people involved in their direct care, wearing the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the personal protective equipment supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

This month, we're in a unique situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our human interconnectedness globally and the responsibilities we have for each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organisation.
The camaraderie and concern we've seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people we're lucky to work with are.
I could not feel more gratitude and pride for all of you being my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me how much he appreciated our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this coming week we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our focus and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be the appropriate response to what we're facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, shop for something, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If he's sick, he doesn't work.
Although it shouldn't be necessary to say it, we do.
No sick leave or paid time off is required; just inform your manager and help your team review the schedules and timetables to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, of T&C Operations, so T&C can help with support and ensure that management is aware of your situation).
People who work by the hour will get paid in full.
As we said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and fellow hourly staff.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask you to do is contact your manager so we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some things we should keep doing.
The Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, are performing critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and change our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all concentrate on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new targets and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to the delegates and teams as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we've also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may take some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely since before know that this mode requires adaptation, so they give the following suggestions:
Limit the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to cut them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
It adopts video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to control the chat questions and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send technical support an email if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The Operations team at RR HH is analyzing guidelines on ergonomics based on webinars to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editatones, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We inform you that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to fulfil your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the global community seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief over the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia's and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 UTC, for a special staff meeting.
We'll take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently being heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues or anything else you may need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and act as a liaison when needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations at RR HH.
None of these changes should be considered as a departure from our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that right now our work and our obligations are probably going to have to be adapted in a way that has not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and that is why we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the Union's financial interests are fully respected.
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an entry point to cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is generally referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metal enzyme found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a renal C-terminal domain of colectrin amino acid transporter.
ECA2 is a type I single-membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to the venous arterial and endothelial cells, and to the smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract ECA.
The ECA breaks off the hormone from angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is a vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also separate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apoline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy continue.
A systematic review with meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 determined that 'the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases'.
In addition, 'the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and who had an increased risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as robust for the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAH inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It's already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government.StopKorona! was launched in North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore's BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry app for patients living in Moscow who have received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential inefficiency if application adoption is limited to a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The organisations set eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
the expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have extinctions clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights should be established to respond to such abuse;
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the information provided by the Member States is kept up to date and that the information provided by the Member States is kept up to date.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server systems need to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an app was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate alerts via text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert about possible contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites.Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized systems for privacy protection.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a large amount of published research dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.
In these protocols, the personal identification data never leaves the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report "Applications Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect to achieve widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claim would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Refillation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research that is currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein, and ribophosphatease ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest which they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain to the more similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state trials with chlorine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under a US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are underway.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative for an average of four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would turn to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump administration about buying the drug.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
Drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary studies prior to trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two run by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with a moderate disease and one for those with a more serious disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are underway for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding or women who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several blood thinners are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency has published guidelines for its use.
On 14 April, a multi-centric study with 300 patients was announced in Italy investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocking the IL-6 receptor): approved by the Chinese government.
I'm not sure.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many attempts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, five potential vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platforms that have moved to Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be planned or developed).
A phase I or phase II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is usually randomized, is placebo-controlled and is performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (continuing in 'preclinical' research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly-tied vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human trials to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is coding a vaccine by mouth with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine had been synthesized and that testing was beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was beginning a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that it was working with 11 isolated people and that, although it is progressing rapidly, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human trials are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine", which the German Government complained about.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The potential BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human testing of the potential final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the CEPI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
Other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The potential vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical measures to counter COVID-19 research projects, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian businesses and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced tests of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent responses from specific antibody antigens (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacterium and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, the industrial sector and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the ECA2 transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlight the need for Tier 3 biosegurity containment measures for live virus handling and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
b'The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorganism failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually by drips produced when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced by exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it is also possible to spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
We recommend wearing masks for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary: some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend to use them, while others demand their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and facial or lip bleeding.
It is less common to see symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal drip and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed chest cramping and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5 percent of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is unknown at this time and is being studied.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) of Korea reported that 20 percent of confirmed cases continued asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began listing asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was conducted.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel up to 15 feet [4.5 m].
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause aerosolisation of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person usually infects two or three more people.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on products with 99 percent copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly, as soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it bursts its protective bubble.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "specilla" (peplomer) to connect to ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12 percent of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in serious illness.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombombosis (25%) was detected in patients in the UCI with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 is tropicated by the epithelial cells that express ECA2 from the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T-cells were observed to be correlated with IL-6 secretory monocyte recruitment and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In the autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on samples of the airways obtained by nasopharyngeal swab; however, samples of nasal swabs or sputum may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with a two-week difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) was being developed, but was not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glazed opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, a disordered pattern in empedration (lobulilar septal enlargement with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pulmonary cells, atypically large pulmonary cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADHD) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: organization of exudate in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventative measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing and, if you don't have towels, using the inside of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDC has recommended the use of cloth covers in public places, one reason being to limit transmission by asymptomatic people.Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling crowded public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. As there is no vaccine expected until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after snoring, coughing, or sneezing.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol content, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is the result of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antiseptic".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that anyone suspecting they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.
Intensive care and pulmonology in the United States compiled recommendations from several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parecetamol (acetaminophen), instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when procedures that can generate aerosols such as intubation or manual ventilation are performed.
CDC recommends health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to prevent air transmission.
The recommended equipment are PPE jacket, mask, eyewear and medical gloves.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
When no masks are available, CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support for people hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 is being actively studied and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipression in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two benefits people in critical condition the same way.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden increase in serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 percent were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators with different pressure control and PPTE modes are needed to maximize oxygen supply while minimizing the risk of respirator- and pneumothorax-related lung injury.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take until 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested on people with serious illness.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments.The FDA granted a temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for any disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect 'close contact' and therefore a potential risk of infection by monitoring data.
Each user can also monitor the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-containment but also alerts local health officials.Macro data analysis of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they came into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summarized location data of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile operators have informed him that "in any case, 40 percent of people continue to move around".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distressed about quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may follow a mild progression with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of contracting a serious infection from the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SRAG and SROM, but data from COVID-19 is insufficient.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to water respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorganism failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disruption and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Coagulation alteration, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6 percent of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while renal function alteration is seen in 4 percent of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days passed between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among males was 2.8 percent and among females was 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudate in both lungs.
Viral cytopatic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
In 11.8 percent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized had a preexisting condition, and the availability of medical resources and socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that later gave positive coronavirus.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and animal by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed to the first date of onset of symptoms as December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fatality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate is 6.9 percent (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the diagnosed patient fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infectious fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-dependent and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people became infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected younger people, so there was a relatively low mortality rate, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined from blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004 percent of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women closes only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 for men and 1.7 for women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
The sex-based immune differences, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations above naming to prevent stigmatisation.
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease water for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in time, a local startup engineered the valves and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged that spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, the researchers are looking to develop a full virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge to developing vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute the bulk of Chinese research, including nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries, which are due to be reported by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible COVID-19 drugs was underway. Several antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of remdesivir's effectiveness.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir compassionately.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chlorokoquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial barley of S protein that performs transmembrane serine-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release may be a complication of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.
It is in a phase II, non-random national trial in Italy after positive results in people with serious illness.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, you will counteract these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunization method without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of recovered patients' blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
