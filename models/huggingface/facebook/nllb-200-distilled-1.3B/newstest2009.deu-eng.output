The Prague stock market is plunging into a slump.
After the sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares amounted to almost half of the normal daily turnover.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed Monday's slump with another six percentage points at the start of Tuesday's trading.
This time, the reason for the bust was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which had refused to support a financial sector stabilisation plan, is reflected.
The fall of stocks in Asia
Shares in Asian stock markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng stock market in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the day, but later recovered some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets were closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide", said Hong Kong's chief monetary officer Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, so independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are on a par with those in the United States.
The American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the draft for supporting the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a financial-system bailout plan that would cost up to $700 billion.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indexes posted their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar drop from 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as there were signs that the draft would not pass the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes a concession: the U.S. government is allowed to pump $700 billion into the banks.
The top representatives of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote on this is due early next week.
The American legislators have made a breakthrough in talks to pass a rescue plan in the form of a $700 billion bailout of the American financial system.
However, this does not mean victory.
The members of Congress have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate is expected to vote on the plan by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a notification that the plan is being adopted should be the first major psychological factor for a revival in financial markets.
However, there is a 're-awakening' afterwards, because of the complex mechanisms for how markets could be helped in practice.
The plan must be effective.
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differences on what a package to stabilize the market should look like", said Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government fund.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the aid is limited to the minimum necessary.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The recovery plan must be continued, but I think we are on track", says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also having a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to reassure investors against trading in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a congressional decision could affect trading on Monday.
But it is still unclear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, and there is uncertainty about whether negotiations could still fail at the last minute over a problem.
The legislators hope to pass it in the next few days.
The law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid allocated to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be made available as quickly as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the remaining money if it feels the program is not doing its job, and that's another $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
The President has veto power over this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program has remained the same, which was based on obtaining financing to buy back bad mortgage securities that have fallen in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, ending benefits and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The Treasury should run this.
"We have worked very hard and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who have problems paying off their mortgages.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the goal of reducing the monthly costs for borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, but will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because you don't know what the mechanism is and what the price is for buying up the problem assets.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses", Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"It is far more important that Congress agrees to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement to adopt is the most important thing at this moment", Marek stressed.
Duel on the edge of a knife, MP3 player versus cell phone.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to get yourself a player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a really expensive turntable for your home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on.
Once such musical innovations are released, they do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if you have any LPs of Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on your shelf, you probably dream of at least one of these.
So it's the same with music on the go, so with compressed music, in simple terms -- music in MP3 format.
Here again, there are price and quality categories.
It may not be acceptable for one person to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably find it hard to get headphones for twenty crowns off the market.
Two extremes, with enough room in between for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can do much more than just play music, but they don't even hint at what cell phones can do.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, it has a better camera, a worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if you add in the smartphones and the communicators, you've got almost a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of cell phones also has its drawbacks.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you'll need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-consuming activities.
Few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
So you should expect the cheap phones to play only a few hours of music.
If you still use the phone occasionally, buy a charger for the office - even for more expensive devices - to be safe.
MP3 players, you won't have this problem, even the less good ones can last at least nine hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small number of these devices have a USB port, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play music directly to a storage device, but few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in cell phones without reduction.
With players, you don't need special software except for exceptions (iPod).
All you have to do is feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most cell phones and players create a music library of their own, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the address book, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, cell phones can be more
When choosing a particular device, you should ask about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If you prefer music as a backdrop and listen to it briefly every day, for example on the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which is something almost every cell phone can do.
You also don't have to control what music formats a phone or a player can handle.
MP3 is created by everyone, and most of the music you get is going to be in that format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better cell phones also make it possible to buy music online.
All you have to do is access the relevant pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile Internet and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a powerful argument for getting a music phone.
Unfortunately, the providers' offerings are poor and usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest.
But it is generally assumed that this kind of music sales (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone.
If you feel like listening to something, reach for the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it does matter whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you can get a decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that they don't have regular headphones.
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3.5 mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players lies in the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - players can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a misplaced mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous data bill.
Which device should you use?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (M2 type, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But be careful.
The basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, you can go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or whatever.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you will not have to put more than EUR 1 500 on the table.
If you are a more demanding listener, you may prefer to use specialized cell phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 controls, and the ease of use is thus close to that of a single MP3 player.
The most advanced is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price range of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum) are provided by MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will be coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I did .
The Czech mobile market is quite mature, with Czech operators offering virtually all the services offered by their Western European partners.
However, something is missing here - a virtual supplier that forces the classic ones to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't keep you waiting much longer.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really makes a fight legend.
It may seem paradoxical, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration rate of well over 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
This is often echoed by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a traditional provider with its own network would not have much of an opportunity (and would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, which was then also met by traditional mobile operators.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Czech Republic is able to comply with the new rules.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look long for examples.
In February this year we reported on the launch of the virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the company managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not require relatively high costs to build, operate and maintain a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually present themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, but often with a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheaply as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to target a non-cliché audience.
This is because this provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real people choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust", says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of the virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also take hold in the Czech Republic.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not provided any evidence that the measures in question are imputable to the State.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering.'
The Czech Republic is out of luck, mobile operators say
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"While we are talking about expanding this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not looking very promising.
It will be more likely to be Mobilking's market entry in other countries in our region", says Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation with Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
GTS Novera has long shown interest in launching a virtual mobile operator and wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate sector.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them", said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times will come.
Non-official information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area", said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2's press department in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in rare agreement with O2's statement, adds: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on".
She adds: "T-Mobile's network will hardly have a virtual provider by the end of the year.
We would have to have a concrete offer at this point to think so short term".
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market failure in the market for the provision of services.
Miroslav Čepický comments: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider the best from the customer's point of view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.'
The responsible authorities - working hand in hand with the providers
The behaviour of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be given easy access to the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to anything is also evidence of the long back and forth around the creation of U:fon.
The pressure on ČTÚ was probably the strongest at the time when U:fon entered the market, from T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is a good argument for not allowing a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and in particular on its services.'
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other advanced countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) is the sole owner of the Office.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive.
'The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would be possible only after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not of sufficient interest to the traditional suppliers", says Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his reply to our inquiry.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the Union.
This is more than a concern for an authority which represents the interests of consumers and is supposed to ensure, among other things, that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: 'In foreign countries where virtual operators operate normally, their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in mobile phone prices.'
However, the pressure to ensure the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not in the interest of ÚOHS.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
'The Authority has not detected any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant position on the market and therefore does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its activities on the market.
The telecommunications regulator is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual operators", Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious issues.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by ČTÚ, which considers telecommunications to be a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, take a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for a virtual provider to enter the market.
And the mobile operator has - logically - a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily has a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if this argument is not accepted, the fact that three mobile operators are strikingly similar should at least serve as a warning to ÚOHS.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the ČTÚ's powers to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised that it would improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if no one's looking
The first is the existence of pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the information provided by the Member States is not used to mislead consumers.
Own mobile phone services are provided by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to selected customers.
The fun of it is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a key customer, he will then receive special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
'If there are cases you describe, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract, which we will then deal with, which could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company concerned,' Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.
However, it is unlikely that this will not be discussed by the operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may have thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a practice.
The fact is that these companies do not generate negligible profits from their activities and, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out that there are potential problems: "The law allows for this type of speculation, but the services of these companies are used by only a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name and therefore cannot be fully used by them as normal customers of mobile operators.'
But that alone would have to make the CTU seem at least strange.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionizing radiation.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
It should be added that the ÚOHS has a fairly strong competence to detect such activities and, if it does not wish to, does not have to be satisfied with the declaration by the providers that they were not aware of them and that their terms and conditions prohibited it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As already emphasised several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers has led to a significant drop in prices for the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulatory bodies intervened, which were not trying to protect the interests of the mobile operators but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
In our experience we cannot escape the impression that uncertainty in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But we're not throwing the gun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be back on track.
If an operator allows the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive to call than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland at a ceremony on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocals were performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices who are distinctive and popular for the solo versions.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction for both and then for the choir, so that the text would be well understood, so that a harmony would be created", says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed on the stage of the Ständtheater in 1834 in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it on spontaneously.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What's the sound of the "new" anthem?
The Prague transport companies will also be promoting for the first time on a chip on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague's transport companies as the date when the first passengers on a subway, tram or bus will board with an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it simultaneously played on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons are also available online from yesterday on the transport companies' website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the window at subway stations where they have to wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon online, and it is played on the Opencard at one of the city library's 13 branches.
"At these points, travellers also have a desk with trained staff to advise on online shopping and to display the coupon on the map", says Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the opencard at self-service machines, which are located in some subway lobbies.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket counters, and passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there will be 80", Opatrný adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automated machine instead of the driver
The machines that will be working from tomorrow are easy to operate.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the pre-purchased coupon will play itself out.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
The main means of transport are the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly serve the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport system, train attendants have readers to check the validity of the time and zone coupons", explains Filip Drápal of Ropid, the ticket control organisation that compiles timetables for Prague's transport operators.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver but the open card must be placed in a marked place on the side of the ticket office.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, it is easier to ask the driver for this information", Drápal says.
Passengers who do not use suburban buses and do not know when the coupon expires can go to the vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
This will display the information on the validity of his documents on the display of the apparatus.
The Sudetenlanders demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had requested in 1945 that the Bohemian Forest be annexed to the United States.
This is shown by a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
In 1945 some Sudeten Germans reportedly appealed to the U.S. president with this hope.
This is shown, among other things, by a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter not to allow the return of the "Sudden Gull" - which had been taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be sure of the words that the American troops are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says a letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of the Sudetenland".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protective rule over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that you, without regard for the views of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this territory, attribute to a foreign state which has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the Allied victory", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President has any doubts about the attitude of the Germans of Bohemia, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Bohemian Forest to decide whether the inhabitants would become part of the USA or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, it does, in the opinion of some contemporaries, paint a good picture of the expectations of Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans must have at least suspected that they would be negotiated for deportation from the republic, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was stationed in the Baltic Sea as a Budweiser German.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they got home, they would be able to speak Czech", says Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected, in his opinion, to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don't think so, then pay!
A campaign with a lot of emotion for drivers
The most expensive road safety operation in Czech history.
This is also how the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The government of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage drivers from dangerous driving.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and on flyers.
It's supposed to deter drivers from speeding and drinking at the wheel.
And remember to check in before you leave.
The campaign aims to raise awareness among young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotion.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don't think so, then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood, it says "pay".
This is supposed to mean that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one's own life.
The commercials will shock viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is quite common to see images of drastic images of accident victims.
The Czech Republic is also a major contributor to the reduction of road accidents and fatalities.
The commercials were produced by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar loaf and whips for drivers
"The motto of the drivers is "sugar bread and whips".
Sugar bread means that if you drive in red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
He believes that signs that alert drivers to a danger are even less effective.
"If you put up a static warning sign, it will probably soon be absorbed into the environment and drivers will not notice it", says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made with Palestine and Syria in return.
This was emphasized in an interview published on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similarly high percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bars and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work", he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he considered an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights", Olmert reiterated.
"The Syrians know all too well what they must give up to regain the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Qaeda terrorist network and the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq", the Prime Minister specified.
Questions after the accident: are bus stewards illegal?
They don't know the law, they can't walk around on a bus
In the context of the tragic accident of a bus belonging to the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act", said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at that moment, unfortunately, next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also crash or brake sharply while the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The bus is also equipped with parking spaces according to the vehicle registration.
If this is not provided for on the bus, passengers must sit.
The buses of Student Agency have no stopping places, as the company's director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not at first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was withdrawn and we reached a consensus that passengers should be allowed to use the toilet while travelling if they have their seat", he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal definition of the role of a steward - no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only defines the concept of a vehicle attendant, but it does not define their rights and duties", adds Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, however, believes that the law covers this problem in retrospect.
'It depends on whether the bus has parking spaces in the product approval.
That's all", he stresses.
Buses are divided into buses with parking spaces and a speed limit, buses with parking spaces and a higher speed limit and buses without parking spaces with a maximum speed limit and seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
BESIP's road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"There are few dangers in a smooth ride, the situation is similar to servicing an airplane.
Here, too, turbulence is uncertain, and the stewardess may bump her head".
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then, of course, the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations", he says, adding that the law does not fully address this issue.
Jančura is ready to cancel services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers steward services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this capacity.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward profession is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers are available for travelers upon boarding.
This would also reduce costs", he says.
The director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, who is concerned about safety, explains the lack of stewards on his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have flight attendants, but we've been fighting them from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end in some fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young flight attendant from the Pilsen region who had worked for the company for two years was injured.
The Slovenian truck probably left the lane without blinking and blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid the truck by making a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front section of the truck.
The Commission considers that the two seats were sold to the stewards.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked".
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could lead to a legal regulation on which a 30-strong team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda either, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the steward's work to be something that could pose a significant risk to the safety of passengers", says Hanzelka, with police and occupational safety authorities in charge of bus safety.
Dusseldorf hopes are on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB board to the House staff is not without great words.
The merger of the Düsseldorf-based money institution and the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", the letter said.
WestLB would bring a 'competence block' with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In addition, the Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the banking sector is able to compete effectively with the other sectors.
That's what you read when a board wants to demonstrate their ability to act in a difficult time.
The fact is that WestLB, which has been hit, is still under enormous pressure.
The Commission has also been informed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian government that time was running out to find a future solution.
The same link between Deka Bank, which is known to savings bank customers for its investment funds, and WestLB has been discussed for some time now, including on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas made it clear at the time of the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August that he saw no point in a merger of the Mainzer Landstraße bank with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is half owned by the Landesbanks and the Savings Bank Associations, has entrusted the Management Board with the task of holding discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, only just begun, as the financial centre says.
Deka Bank, which has 3000 employees and is one of the main employers in the financial district of Frankfurt, is not the first to be mentioned in connection with consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a moment that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
But this tripartite alliance was not successful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's participation.
The other two houses were also not compatible.
The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was instead transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have been repeated speculations about merging Deka Bank with state banks.
However, Günther Merl, the CEO of Helaba, had recently spoken out against Planspiele's merger with his house.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the public sector is able to participate in the process of reform.
Now that the Bavarian state election is over, the first step is to merge BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to merge grows, you'll run out of partners.
In the south, it would be a junior partner, although it has so far far far weathered the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with West LB was halted earlier this year by the Hessen-Thüringen Savings Bank and Giroverband, which owns 85% of Helaba.
I'd rather stay on the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
The other is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanks had not yet been answered by the German Savings Bank Association.
The result could be a break-up of the West Bank, which is not desired there.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
How this can be achieved by merging individual units with Deka Bank remains to be seen.
The second Vienna weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, he says, Elena is his girlfriend, and everything is different.
Behind them, at the Kaiser five-liter barrel, a massive bearded man stands and demonstrates to the 200 or so Oktoberfest travelers what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus stop next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 11:45 this evening, "Destination Monaco, festa della birra", arriving at 6:30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, one bus is for Brazilians only.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing alongside their flag, they've been celebrating all night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furry fur and glasses with wide silver irons, owns the buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
Go at night, go on Wiesn during the day, come back at 10.30.
Marco says that staying overnight would be an unnecessary expense.
The cost of the trip is 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity rule, the health insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And the buses are rolling into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
It's quiet on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
The buses are being used in Brixen and in wooden churches, where several other buses with Italian plates stop on the 8 motorway just outside Munich.
When the Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, as scheduled, there are already 50 other buses waiting from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left side of the card is "Oktoberfest", in broken letters, next to the Internet address of the Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "If the doors to the beer tent open, it means run!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the back seats of the tent.
"Not in front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco yells, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that we're being polite!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third, "come back here at 11:30 this evening".
And now for the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap is tied to the trees, signs and even the electoral poster of a large Bavarian people's party as a waymark.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the Viennese, known as the "Italian weekend".
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the services provided by the Member States.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a national statistic in which Italians take first place ahead of the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The Italian court brunch is especially popular.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also said that the German banking sector would not be spared the crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Munich-based real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the Dax, is to receive a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced itself for long-term projects for which it had lent money in the extremely short term - which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves had decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net income from financial operations had fallen to zero compared with the same period of the previous year, while income from write-offs of receivables and certain securities and from the settlement of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher returns from reimbursement of downstream costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the taxation system and from the business of group companies, the profit margin of around 16% was still moderate.
The former state financier had initially speculated in commercial real estate loans after its privatisation in 1990, which were then spun off into the Aareal Bank.
The Department of Finance had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the State (private-public partnerships, PPP) and had diversified internationally.
The value of the subsidiary will now have to be written down by Hypo Real Estate, which will have a 'substantial material effect' on the group's profit and loss account, it is said, rather indefinitely.
The fact is, the dividend was cancelled.
In 2007, it had already been cut by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the takeover of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on interbank refinancing because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has largely dried up again as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for a part of Depfa's loan portfolio - some EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the loan will cover the group's financing needs for the foreseeable future and shield the company from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets.
Other sources indicate that the funds have secured the refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE's CEO Georg Funke, however, stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketable position of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is the hope of the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that the financing does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite is also not to be ruled out.
The Bank was reportedly close to bankruptcy late Sunday evening, so even the at least temporary rescue could not calm the spirits.
The stock price plunges by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up quite well.
If the primary debt shows little change, the prices of the subordinated debt will decline more markedly.
The main issues are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
Although the real estate bonds used to be a speculative investment option, their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp worsening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only managed to cope with the crisis by taking over Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are ready to support the system, it is possible to expect a timely payment of pensions.
Or it may be that what few people dare to hope for now will happen - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the news that is being shared with the partial nationalization, the near-certainty has now become a legitimate hope.
This should leave long-term creditors in particular with some sleepless nights to decide whether to break their commitments.
Currency investors can use a dash to make a loss carry-over for future tax payments on gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is expected to present herself at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I was having trouble even on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, heading towards Kawasaki, and it takes 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not get lost.
The beginning of classes at Tachibana seems not to be as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students come in from eight o'clock until twenty to nine o'clock, when a brief discussion with the teacher, the home room, begins.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
I didn't have a school uniform yet, so I put on an old skirt from my host mother, plus a blouse, blue knee socks, and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were all waving and giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It is a vital part of Japanese girls' vocabulary and means "kind, sweet".
Then I quickly recovered to my seat.
The girl next to me grinned pretty wide, thinking it was an honor to have the exchange student sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, I was literally stormed.
Everyone was talking confusedly and giggling and asking me holes in my stomach - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, at the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother made me a lunchbox like this, which is a little different from the boring German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat.
I usually have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste totally new.
I'm sure everything is delicious.
Well, except for the salted plums, maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a homemade bento, which she then creates with special skill - hoping to get to know the boy better during the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I used to say:
"Because it fascinates me".
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to come here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach fleeing danger, does that mean it feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
But how can you check if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions by renowned scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove this so far, whereas we can't even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But once we turn to another species and we address issues of perception or consciousness in general, we enter a dead end because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: it pretends to be dead, flies away, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, leading some scientists to conclude that there is a similar subjective experience.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there's reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature is likely to be the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is related to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, however it may be made, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or analyzed by our own experience because of the special hardware, then its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my talk is about the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is supposed to be more scientifically accessible.
You could study the processes of consciousness in animals without regard to their content, and that's exactly what happens in studies of primate short-term memory, especially the example of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick took, is shifting to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What about the sensations?
I'm going to take it back to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in a brain that's aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its effects, such as physical reactions) is recorded in working memory.
So, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
In connection with the nature of language, subtle gradations of perception result because we can use words and grammar to differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brainstem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, but focusing more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in intersex sensations.
I cannot contradict this in theory, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to be fear in rats and humans probably feels that way in both cases: But how can you test whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does a cockroach run away from danger if it feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behavior is not proof of similarity of experience.
While neural comparison is helpful: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove that in humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm more interested in exploring emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
But at any rate, we're seeing some progress at the neural level, if you measure the same thing in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and consciousness in rats, nor sensation, I don't know if they exist.
You may think I'm short-sighted, but I'd rather be moving forward than running into a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist, you know.
UEFA President Platini: Poland and Ukraine granted grace
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashyunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland", said Waszjunik.
"This is not amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries".
The two hosts are lagging behind in terms of the timetable for the construction or renovation of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at full speed", said Ukrainian association president Grigory Surkis.
"We will be monitored by UEFA at all times".
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
The Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to UEFA President Michel Platini assuring him that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer".
Several major leaguers had been sentenced to forced relegation last season alone for manipulation, and even the league's start had to be postponed.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She was promoting a new movie, talking about personal matters in an interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-boyfriend, Hollywood star Meg Ryan, who outed her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams and he strikes back.
Late rose war between ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting an ugly fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She said she didn't learn the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press release for her new film "The Women" - a story about adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his coming out as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's monstrous", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg is re-reading and re-compacting the story of our relationship again".
It is also "regrettable" that the couple's 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that divorce brings to any child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends his remarks with the side-turn: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel blessed to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, a recent study found that flights have become as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel stays have become cheaper again, according to a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant decrease in the second quarter after a price increase in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared with 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travelers paid 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express attributes this to the weak dollar, which has led to a "declining desire for American tourists to travel".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The Norwegian city even holds the record for hotel prices in Europe, with a 26.3 percent increase.
The trend in air fares was also up in the first quarter:
Because of the fuel leak, passengers in economy class have had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights have become as much as 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared with the previous quarter, but in business and first class prices were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The study found that prices on German domestic flights have even halved.
The reason for the price drop is, on the one hand, the slowdown in economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market is fragmented.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air transport between the USA and Europe, increases competitive pressure.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Belgian authorities on the measures in question.
HSV beat Gladbach by 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still can't find a working elf.
By Kristoffer Klein, increase the fracture landing for national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach was late to the game and failed with a lever on the bar.
His message was precise, it was convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the lobby of the Hamburger Arena.
Not much was going on in the catacombs, the halftime break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than many accomplished actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will be similar to, "Come with gate two!"
The implementation was not completed.
"It wasn't all pretty today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt himself would have liked it "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers have to thank the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV turns 121 this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience was already celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the flashing sign on the video wall that her club was the top of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects the tabular interim evidence is more about the League's unpredictability than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - is slow, but it still cannot shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling", Jol demanded.
After the defeat in the vote
Wall Street is all about fear.
First news of the failure of the bailout package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop by 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day loss in his history.
Later, the Dow picked up a little bit.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down by just over five percent at 10,579 counters.
The technology stock Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at minus 1,548 points.
The biggest losers at that time were the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffett had joined the company.
The rescue plan is to provide funds for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage securities.
The amount is not to be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share warrants from the financial companies, which could be redeemed in the event of a corresponding price development, in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA fall
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not solve the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German giant Hypo Real Estate plunges, tearing the Dax down.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (DAX) into the negative.
The share of the Munich real estate financier temporarily lost three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the German government and private banks, while the Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6,000 mark and fell by 3.7 percent to 5,839.
Worldwide, the stock markets went into a tailspin.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout could not be enough to get financial markets back on track.
The Dow dropped 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives was about to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock markets also had only one direction: in London the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex fell 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to close at 12,595.75.
Arcandor shares in the MDax declined after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed up the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the spacecraft Ulysses flew through space.
You're in danger of freezing to death because of the fuel lines that are about to freeze.
Scientists have been puzzled for years by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver by spacecraft to gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This will save the probes a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses spacecraft.
But what has puzzled researchers for years is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect from the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes will be unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They named it Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and he tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly by using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could be very close to Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously has an attractive force that can be observed in other heavenly bodies.
It is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up well over one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Egypt: Abducted tourists released
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, the tourists abducted in Egypt are to be released, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
A shooting spree before the release reportedly killed six hostages.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
I'm told ransom negotiations are already underway.
German people are always being kidnapped.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara appear to be free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports on Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are checking her health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
It is still unclear what caused the shooting before the hostages were released, but an Egyptian security official said the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", said the official.
He said that "it was just about taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper El Masri El Jom reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Abuse by Stepfather 'Lead to Suicide'
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court has been told.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was given a six-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court has learned that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
In a confession, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for her death".
The court heard that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had bound her and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was being persecuted for the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had told him that Ms Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "abandoned her life".
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her".
"I did not sexually coerce her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen said of Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still, it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not".
He added: "I recognize the effect that Stephany's father and mother described as having on their daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman".
Officials responsible for lost data are being prosecuted
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the weakest charge in the law and there's no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action came as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and the Cabinet".
The employee, whose name cannot be released, is being charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that deals with the safe keeping of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he leaked contained classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing companies consider B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than £80 million after the bailout of the Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government has made £14 billion available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all the companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The general director of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that the companies and their members should pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited to those 700 financial institutions that accept deposits every year.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been prudent are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the Housing Associations Association, told the BBC that he thought this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that were cautious during the housing boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs by those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records began in 1945.
"We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing societies and their members from potentially significant costs".
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of that year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost double that.
Since building societies are bilateral organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk is going up five pence a liter.
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence a liter starting Monday.
It's the second price hike this year, after a two-pence hike in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court denied bail on charges of blackmailing a businessman out of 50 million taka ($729,700) while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, has demanded that the military-backed interim government first grant her unrestricted freedom.
Correspondents say that although she was granted a stay of detention to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear if she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh as part of her release.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the Supreme Court's decision.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail pleas because it says she does not need to be granted bail as she is already on probation abroad for treatment abroad", her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will appeal to the High Court".
Her lawyers claim she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children were not vaccinated because of violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week launched a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south due to security concerns.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede the thousands of staff who were carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses the ITV case
BskyB lost its action against the Commission's decision to reduce its stake in competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that BskyB's stake distorts competition and allows it to exert an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of ITV's stake cast doubts on ITV's independence, prompting the Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom have all spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was unreasonable and excessive, especially since BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has assigned a special investigator to deal with the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now expected to determine whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or resolved, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to compel witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. attorneys general from their positions in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors were being dismissed for poor performance.
However, it was later found that the fired prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their peers, which led many observers to view the firings as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of Democratic voter fraud.
U.S. Attorneys are charged with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but not for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the dismissals and eventually resigned.
A number of officials in the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report specifically criticized Gonzales' role, saying he had "main responsibility" for the layoffs, "abandoned" his leadership role and showed "exceptional disinterest" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf 's epic song is to be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is set to be honored at the Q Music Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will be accepting his special gold award at the ceremony in London next week, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" tops the list of nominees for this year's awards, having been shortlisted in four categories.
Q Magazine editor Paul Rees said that there are some songs that transcend such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, which was written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice provided by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later, it was discovered that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of main thoroughfares, avenues, side streets, and other bypasses, some famous and others convenient.
Yet, even experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are no road signs.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street has its admirers, though.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean path to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the longtime neighbor who says she is fascinated by the short alley simply because it is one of the remnants of the block's past.
But the city's department responsible for protecting and constructing the residential buildings and for the road has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the city council's land use committee this month, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the road to be purchased by the construction company.
Still, the committee prefers the road to remain in the city's hands and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in Municipal Council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to remain in the city's possession", she said.
"There could be proposals for how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that public access is maintained".
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it would re-pave the small street and install seating, including for a café that the company plans to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and turn it into a public gathering place", she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street, stressing that the department's job was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic appeal.
Some believe the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock memorial that closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
The band-aid was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of junk, rags and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity  a virtually unchanged fragment of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), published a portion of the city's history conversation about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac that stays dark even during the day, marked by rusty metal doors to the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this one evening recently.
A rat ran down the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store now stands.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current condition.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
The debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of applicants for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California Studies and senior director of the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of Not As Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.
The Spanish voters are a complicated task.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
The Obama campaign mentioned that "African-American and Hispanic students are less likely to graduate than white students" - which is true.
To close this achievement gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition period in education for those who are just learning English.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, clashes with his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived in the country, are learning English.
Yet in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-graders passed the state math test at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the fourth-year students scored well on their English test.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
The school also practices the approach of teaching in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should be concerned about, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasises the almost exclusive use of English in vocational education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico, and 12 months later you would walk into the classroom and not recognize him.
"It works", she remarked, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with large numbers of Hispanic and other English-speaking students?
The school's performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by remarking that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, he should carefully consider education models that work, rather than belittling and trivializing them.
Oil prices fall as economic concerns flare
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil trading on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been rocked by both financial turmoil on Wall Street and powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 a barrel this month before rising again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again worried, even though congressmen had announced they had agreed over the weekend on a bailout plan that was supposed to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the escalating crisis, according to a government announcement Monday, Citigroup is to acquire the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout, it seems to have failed to revive sentiment in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decline further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a notice to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they write, that the commodity markets will also be affected.
"From a commodity market perspective, our biggest concern is whether the US-American virus will spread globally, particularly to China".
The Bank's analysts have revised down their oil consumption expectations for the coming year due to weak economic growth and have cut their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all after being caught more times in the Jets jersey than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then he saw Sunday's second quarter, where the Jets turned a scoreless game into a victory.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was due to bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres' pass came to Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving partnership took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one slipping out as a pinch hitter and the other 10 seconds into the half.
"I didn't really try", Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote was a success, no matter what people think".
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, defensive quarterback Kurt Warner was taking a swing.
Outfielder Darrelle Revis intercepted a missed throw and converted it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then took a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss forced on Bowens was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Erik Mangini replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To both of these questions, because the Jets gave up 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time".
Brewster breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the greatest long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to complete the 42.2-kilometer distance in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
By winning the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his varied career, having won at least one world title or set a world record on every mile of the track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympics marathon, perhaps overstating his fear that air pollution might worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In near-ideal conditions - sunny and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya switched to long distance, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a result of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Apparently, he came back from his break refreshed and not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training a week ago and I had some concerns today, but in the end it was great".
He has been criticized -- particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival -- for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records in the race.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of the breaststroke as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyan riders on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the midpoint of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pace makers had slowed down.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final start to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's category, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, finished a remarkable year by setting the seventh fastest time ever in 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games due to problems described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run cleverly, first letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners out but overtaking them after 20 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardship of black life in a city of a very special kind.
Hidden among the lush greenery of Orlando's surrounding theme parks, a few miles from the glittering, loud, gigantic bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture are evident.
Eatonville, the first all-black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the town with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, two schools and no jail".
Today, it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to honor the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city she describes, and the one that made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression, is and remains in many ways a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, solid and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing".
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about race relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told", says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a member of the city's oldest church.
It has to be true".
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 people with a poverty rate twice the national average.
It is a bastion of literature on the one hand, and an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, black culture of the rural South that has its roots in American slavery.
It's no surprise that the inhabitants here are both proud and wary.
And rightly so, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from her heart and were written in the style of oral history, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the town, which is located very close to Route 77, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida, into the setting of black history and human drama.
Naughty like Oscar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Over the road to the left", she wrote, "is the brown-and-white-painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always tends, although he can hardly read or write".
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever-ever fits in classrooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
This was certainly not a guidebook.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were", says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual innuendo.
She added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into town drunk, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something of her venerable dress style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised her.
"People were always glad to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long", he added as he rocked his chair on a back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were in ruins.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no big memorial service, no big public readings.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage in the least", says Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turning point came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to build a five-lane freeway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main street.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western suburbs.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At that time, a lot of white boys would come and throw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the sidelines", said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car".
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration, calling its decision in Brown v. School Board "insulting rather than respectful of my race".
Residents now say that while the desegregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-esteem of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening", says N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group protecting the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained until teachers and students no longer came from the same place, she added.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide", Ms. Nathiri said.
But civil rights helped make room for other Zora Neale Hurstons -- black writers, actors, and artists who pushed aside prejudice, as she did, with positive self-esteem and statements like, "How can anyone deny themselves the joy of my company?
I don't understand what you're saying".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-lauded Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on bookshelves, making it a part of the American literary canon once again.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community started planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county could destroy by building the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return for the celebration every January.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway brought life to the city, accelerated the process at top speed, and created real pride", said Ms Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's image.
More and more train travelers arrived, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a distinctive Florida town, just six miles from downtown Orlando, and it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rains, as small as when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders seeking to understand Eatonville's history and significance are still often treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission and certain things - like the mural of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men working in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a taste for dark red, still fear that their barricaded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew in size, a heightened sense of homeland pride was born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, no worse or better, and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It's the genuine love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city government or the police department, who he says could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon the other Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, we speak financial Latin fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not even realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
You would never believe that above their heads, in their shoebox-like glass-fronted offices, bankers and hedge fund managers who have a monopoly on New York City are having the worst day of horror every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Suppliers still push metal teacups along sidewalks with loud bangs and carry tablets loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roam between apartments like human pack animals, carrying around 50 ironing shirts that hang from a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagels at sidewalk food stands and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, with all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Even though I had decided to put my duty out on time for the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people lined up.
Not at the cash machines to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank clerk with a license", were queuing for the same reason I was.
But unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they were commuting from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrift banks (a bit like a building society), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks quietly went bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into receivership, and as New Yorkers drove home for the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a buyer to save it.
Fearing another collapse, the office and store workers in line in front of me took their cash to a bank that was considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most of the bailout purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have been acquiring fluent financial literacy in recent weeks.
A woman on the phone at my Chinese family supermarket referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its skinny-looking CEO Dick Fuld with as much familiarity as if she were cursing at a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-something uniformed concierge at my apartment building, has moved on from our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now", she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks".
Muslim graves desecrated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a leftist from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization Cities Against Islamization.
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs with a mosque, crossed with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a grave at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right parties recorded significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were badly damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials say this is an attempt to cover up the motive of the extremists, who are driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is in any way connected to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave desecration, which took place as the Muslim religious month of Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, Austria is going through a period of conscientiousness after the country's rightward shift in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burqas and even expressed his dislike of foods commonly associated with Islam.
In his last speech in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme right is the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is under travel ban
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges suspended Glitter for six months after he informed the authorities that he was traveling to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted permission last Thursday to impose a travel ban after presenting evidence to judges of Glitter's criminal record for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford County Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, Kent Police applied to Ashford District Court for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present".
As required by the sex offender registry, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he was planning to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of up to five years.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country and abroad".
"We believe it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks".
"Kent Police's top priority is to protect the people of Kent and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge District Court in west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for permission to require him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed for four months in the UK in 1999 for possessing child abuse images.
The Home Office said that Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was reassured and pleased that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
̋I welcome the master backstage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no heels, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who forgo concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to look relaxed as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private lives, into those moments that are alien to the audience, I know when I can't find the gesture that's typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expression of hands that are worried that they won't get on stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a varied theatrical approach to some of his stage productions with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of Flamenco photography, ̋reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day, explains the artist, making it clear that ̋Flamenco people' ̋anyone can be, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Ordinary people in portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco makers with my camera.'
Inspired by the 'Cante de las Minas' festival, Bauer set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists and dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image sorting function and the material available, images reminiscent of classical photography were created.
The use of different stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, giving it the modernity and the idea as the farmer understands flamenco: music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
It is not just the dance, the singing, or the instrumental playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and has been the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the near future in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous figures in flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realise it as 'portraits of sports veterans' ( ̃SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project ̋Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer says ̋it's very interesting to photograph people, get to know them and put myself in their life, whether for a short moment or for a long time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or bump into people, personalities that you sometimes don't even know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to make my ideas come true.'
The collection of portraits of the flamenco of today, entitled ̋Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing about is "a madness".
He doesn't yet know where the novel takes place or what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to push ahead with the project he's working on, a novel with Roger Casemant as the protagonist, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, while attending the Hay Festival in Segovia, the favourite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he was working on was "a wild audacity" and "everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel".
`If I were sane, I would not have done it, but I will and I hope to finish the novel at some point', so he ended his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's premium and was voted by most of the audience, is being compared to the old version of "Our Mutual Friend" and is being shown at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which is born from an 'exceptional sense of adventure', from 'joy of reading' and from 'desire to experience more than what appears'; how he writes and 'disciplines' to 'complete the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentaries, the numerous proofs and revisions he makes; historians such as Alejandro Faulkner, Hugo Faulkner and Víctor Dumas are the most influential in his vocation and which 'fiction' images form the basis for it.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and know whether books change lives, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'causes effects' and 'makes people even more divided', so I asked the writers 'not to give in to the lightness' and 'to take responsibility' for their vocation'.
The weather did not play a role in the Pozoblanco festival, which was partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was postponed to yesterday morning.
The organisers, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, have decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
The festival was thus suspended because of the incessant weather, and two of the three festivals were not held.
On Saturday it rained, so the second bullfighting festival could not be held.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullring one by one.
So there was only a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante struck the bull with two horns and an ear, which he had accomplished more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Julio, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded with boo-hoo in his second fight.
In Álava, two people tried to escape control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the municipality of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen ordered the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the 2,000-kilogram load of hashish.
The police chased them and arrested one of the drivers, a 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., the Basque Interior Ministry said.
The person arrested was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when traffic police officers from the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the Armiñon municipal area.
They decided to stop a car to check the route, but the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to evade the control.
The police began the chase until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the side of the road, at which point the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road into a forest.
The police in the town of Ertzaintza eventually caught one of the two, who was carrying 2,178 kilos of hashish in an Iveco Daily car, which was seized by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with bundles of hashish, which were later sent to other police stations for detailed laboratory analysis and weighing.
The officials also found that the number plate was 'double' and therefore did not match the number plate shown on the vehicle documents, which led to an additional arrest for falsifying official documents.
The police of the town of Ertzaintza are continuing their investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned, managed to escape, and to establish the origin of the drugs seized.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. has been taken to a police station for questioning and will be brought before the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, best known for her role as Amanda on Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness saw her strangely trying to get out of her Montecito parking space, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness detailed that Locklear "after 4:30 p.m. pressed the accelerator and made a lot of noise trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking lot, and as she was reversing, she grabbed her sunglasses several times".
A little later, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby road and get out of the car.
The witness was the person who called 911 because she was "scared for Locklears' life".
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was parked across the street, blocking traffic.
She seemed to be disoriented, so they took the officers to a special drug and alcohol treatment center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, and excessive drinking was ruled out from the first moment. "From the initial observations of the officers, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug", the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance, which could not be determined, and taken into local custody at approximately 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from a hospital in Arizona after being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian United Left Federation be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and a member of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sports of the Seville city hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
̋In such cases, I am a great federalist and the Andalusian organisation will be the one who has to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out, pointing out the way the party must approach the man who is still a city councillor in Seville.
Nevertheless, the VL chairman defended the need for transparency' in the possible investigations into the violations Silva may have initiated: The VL has always insisted that such cases be given maximum transparency'.
In this respect, he stressed that education has a strict code of ethics for all public offices.
♪ Blood of May ♪ ♪ The hero book of Garcia ♪
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' ̋Episodios Nacionales', José Luis Carci presents in ̋Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French.
In this way, the cineast has tried to portray 'a range of personalities and social analysis', something he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci said today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo', a film of more than two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, says that this film was the fulfillment of his 'childhood dream' thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago was commissioned by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second centenary celebrations on 2 November in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, provided by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, offered Garcia, he added, the 'unique opportunity' of 'depicting, with decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of a confused Spain which had chosen the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been put backwards by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the filmmaker regrets that the financing of ≪Alatriste' or ≪Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as ≪Sangre de mayo') was not expected, which is why some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezar', participated through his usual way of working: he went on stage with the actors you have to rehearse with first before you start shooting and to those who had not done a casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and respectful, 'part of the job of a film director is to help in the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the film industry in which you work.'
Many of the actors he encounters in Sangre de mayo have to repeat themselves in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, who has been nominated for four Oscars (one of which he won), said that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmmaking, neither 'Sangre de mayo' nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garcia doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
`At first you think you are working for the posterity, later you realize it is just for the sake of prosperity, and now you are satisfied that you have produced another film,' explains Garcia after more than 30 years in the industry.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who was also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and a supporter of abolishing the corset, which restricted women's freedom of movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who had left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the interwar period.
̋I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
̋We try not to tell about her life, but to keep her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance skills helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, the butterfly dance seemed like Guajira, or the snake dance like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm,' she claims.
The production will feature two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again in one of her performances, as he did in La puerta abierta; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her former students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature character.
I am happy that she agreed to work with me, and I am very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; percussion by El Pájaro, as well as viola by Rafa el Viola and collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, who "takes on the role of accompanying the artists who were the divas he falls in love with again and again".
This work also tells in a certain way the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
̋I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have had a huge impact on a particular era and whose work is no longer appreciated and therefore even less appreciated today,' says Bayón.
The show is tonight at 8:30 in the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the ̋Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008), the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
Thus, the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will conclude with the new edition of this work, the international congress in New York, the restoration of the Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia House Museum and the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and, after visiting various places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and is being presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture also received 800 copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, which aims to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The United States can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman .
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them".
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Sensation Reporter", and from the then dominant image of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman came and followed her with his thrilling vision.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a big blow to everyone.
'What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' Robert Redford said, weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest joys of his life.'
No one was afraid to be ridiculed or exaggerated.
As the father of cinema and the father of the country, he died in a sad moment when terrorism and market collapse are feared, when the shattered self-esteem of Americans is desperately searching for reasons to regain dignity.
If in these hard times without virtue, there are only a few people left to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and established in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country where he struggled to fight a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of wonder beats house high over Hollywood regardless of nationality and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not just one man died, but an entire era.
The English film director and Oscar winner Sam Mendes said that working with Newman was no more or less than the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
̋The greatest of us all has left us', said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live the way Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of integrity, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, though there were certainly many possibilities of not being.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven, he'll be proud that on earth his daughters share his fans' views, which isn't necessarily common in America.
Of all the great roles he played, none he was as proud of as that of a faithful husband, a loving father, an attentive grandfather and a philanthropist, they say.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic events in Madrid, after the failure in 2012, it could be 2016.
But I ask myself, are we prepared for this?
Yes, we're following the example of the old streets, I say that's not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my judgment, it was the worst street with everything that was there.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, but if you were to take the evaluation and I could check it, clearly, this wouldn't have passed.
But, let's go over everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket office, which allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they're letting you go ahead, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid traffic jams).
I mean, no.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense is to go there just for that) and (after an endless line) there's the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size `S' (a second nonsense, because I need size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis, it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the road.
Besides having to go out very early to get the chip, there's already a line of at least 15 minutes, and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if we had succeeded once, but to bring them back would be more difficult.
Also, during that 40-minute wait, it looked like rain, so the temptation arose to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow, there's going to be probably 500 people with pneumonia, and some of them like me, because of this chip I got, they're not even going to show up on time for the classification, I can already imagine that the outcome was mis-stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
I think we will be dreaming of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the advances of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an artificial intelligence entity without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a route planner to get around the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember what they were wearing, listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also group the participants into groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but understands that this person is not part of the group she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone and responds that she will soon listen.
Anything but the blue screenshot.
It 's impressive .
That's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, there was very little talk about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and have fewer programs built in.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essentials instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would run five times faster.
All this is just a statement, when you consider that Microsoft added some functionality and "extras" to Windows versions.
The Change of Direction Is Worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is losing its importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome came online, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have skillfully pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system performs a function that can be compared to that of a wife or husband in communicating with his mother-in-law.
That's right, I did.
The system will never go away, but you have to think of his death not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, but more to the web browser.
The computer is just started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the purpose of half the applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
It's lighter, not so over the top, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt.
This photo of this place I took in Redmond, one of the Microsoft employee rest rooms earlier this month.
The machine has a sign: `Your Search. Our Future' printed on it asking people to use their own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for their web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be published at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2009, more likely even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking at the possibility of launching Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore this mark in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, just like Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it's also part of a well-built priest's outfit.
If we begin to enumerate the countless star performances, we can return to the image of a very strong man with a pointed beard who had lifted heavy weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical men's cotton shirt, sleeveless and tailored.
The English speakers call it "tank".
First, because of its great name, although it is known in a narrow circle as `Marcel'.
`La Marcel' stands out for its excellent cotton, its distinctive unisex cut and a small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which these T-shirts feature as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of tanks.
They also have college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cardigan and cashmere, cotton pants, striped T-shirts, baby shorts, mini-shorts.
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as underwear.
You are very charming.
̋I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great performance with her sister didn't stop her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is tiny, but full of joy.
At present, the Gruz brothers take their new fashion business very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than some pretty, rich girls who keep their reputations.
She was in Paris promoting Mango, moving her residence there and also presenting the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short course.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of the ̋Mango Fashion Awards' and attended the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intense work schedule that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister and I are both fascinated by the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk around a city and watch women dress, combine their clothes, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but ultimately, it all comes together and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look through my aunt's closet and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to be careful about my clothes.
You know, we dancers love to have our own style in class and in rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real actor's role.
After all, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, haven't you had a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever when I'm thirty.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise him with much love.
As far as the art of film is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and which were shot last year.
That's exactly what they are, and I'd really like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I really hope that "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them.
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the runway with Naomi Campbell, is that right?
Don't say that.
It's not like I went to the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a while, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organization's charity event, Women for a Better World, and the clothes we're showing.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are many stories about her, and I, as the person who knows her, would tell you that they are not true.
I will support this good cause she's involved in.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do it.
To support the women in the Third World, which is necessary.
Drivers who may relapse due to alcohol levels will have to install the 'alcohol lock'.
The authority orders that the driver who has three official alcohol-related penalties install this system in his car that prohibits him from starting the car while drunk.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Prosecutor General's Office, which said it was a pilot project that would last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, so that he receives a course for re-education in traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
Statistics show that between 30 and 75% of drivers who were reported for DUI more than once returned to driving.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver has taken an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found to be higher than the permissible level.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, and the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of infractions in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes an offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented through the usual channels, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available in any shop on the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
In Mexico and without peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 hours, the time scheduled by the programme, the Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed next to the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez de México DF Airport.
The sun was setting, but its rays still forced me to use my hand as an umbrella to see the royal couple as they stepped out of the plane.
Right on the corridor: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize their official trip.
- Oh, very well, so you can't take people to the airport at this hour.
No, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- There you go.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Navy sailors who are handing out patches.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-blown hair, without the usual peep-toes, perhaps she has been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official procession awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter who likes to joke is waiting for them.
The Best Premium in Fashion
There was probably no better place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially better fashion designer and Bonvivente than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Adwards' fashion competition to promote and internationalise young fashion talents.
The prize is a cash prize of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the window of the Mango branch at Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris and almost cried from emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest store in Europe and it was recently opened.
The biggest store is in London.
So many events have happened that have been connected with it that we would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for presiding over the competition.
Surrounded by many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart broken by the pain of his brother's recent death, pulled himself together, put on the suit from the fashion house, and wore some jewelry from ELAH that was breathtaking, held on to the arms of his son Luis, who is almost six feet tall, and accompanied Valentino to the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the Mango House, greeted the guests and was such a gentleman that he and the Baron de Rotschild ended up without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, she rushed to the store and she had pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she was wearing a long, sexy black dress, and on a night walk through the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a ballet rehearsal room, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of "grand plie".
Inés Sastre, who did not join us in the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile.
The next morning we were greeted by Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance for a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's the life.
1001 Counselling against stress
There's not a thousand, but one more way to forget the chaotic, fast-paced everyday life.
And even if they're few, they're all in one book that tells you how to relax.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse is the thought of getting back into the hectic rhythm that life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that causes the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one way or two ways to combat daily fatigue and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
The number is rising, however, neither more nor less than to 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, massage, and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents a list of options that are tailored to the individual's tastes and time.
The book is called '1001 ways to relax' and the calmness it conveys is brought to the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as the workplace through personal contacts, this handbook refutes that belief.
It also offers methods of staying in touch with nature or suggests 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer rising to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk in their sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, you'll be scared at best, but in reality, it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep-talking.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, during a high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There's no single reason for this phenomenon.
Often, people look for connections to other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic attacks at night, bedwetting, sleep-talking, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be a result of high fiber, stressful situations, or overwork.
Anyway, this is a little-researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is highly variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper, or it may be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and thus develops.
We said it's a positive disorder, so it's not treated unless it's associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is take a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to excite the child before bedtime.
So, choosing quiet play for the child and avoiding stressful TV shows that are terrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a measure of inner calm.
It helps the child sleep peacefully.
If talking in your sleep occurs once, try to keep calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child and the next day, he won't be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake it up.
It's no use, because the child is unconscious, so you'll tear it out of its sleep.
Although the child is talking, it is sleeping, so it is resting.
Remember, if the child shows signs of being frightened after a few appearances, it is recommended that counseling be sought or that the reason for the child's fear be determined.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not feel pressured to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
You won't be able to do anything with that because when the child is asleep, he's unconscious and can't think about it.
Also, you'll hear what it says, but you won't know what it's dreaming and why it's saying it, so be careful about interpreting the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the kid that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even for fun.
It's very scary.
So, don't worry, it's nothing serious, this is a moment that will only last a few minutes.
Illusions ... at last
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhausern is finally back on track.
Without much effort, the yellow and black teams created numerous chances for goals and managed to implement one of them and win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had trouble showing their skill, was not very high.
After a first attack by guest captain Kauffmann, whose teleshot passed just around the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a teleshot, then Brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, letting only the lively Riahi through at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive, with Riahi and Temporale scoring two goals, and Marais scoring the first goal for the Illhausers, who was right to take back a ball that Diebold had defended in a first attempt.
But the ill-fated goalkeeper was not to enjoy his luck for long and was sent off about twelve minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
Denmark, however, failed to take advantage of this and did not pose any major problems to an Illyrian side that only retreated a little to 'compress' its defence, except in the very last seconds of the game when the ball passed very close to the net after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stopover in Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who on Monday blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports, the French President decided to meet with their representatives in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to welcome him 'in a constructive spirit' and hoped he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit coincides with a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by Breton fishermen to implement measures to deal with the extreme rise in diesel prices, which have reached an average record high of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to secure the working conditions and pay of seafarers.
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams nearly ten kilometers long.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
The Quiberon Peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient early in the morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in the Vendée, where the fishing trawlers did not sail out, or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region broke the blockade on the important Total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer delegation decided to wait for the meeting on Wednesday at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reaction to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
̋The strike will continue', because ̋the fishermen will not give in at any point' and ̋will not go to Paris', declared Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents a litre, but they think that the margin of profitability of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents a litre.
Paul Newman the wonderful
The iconic actor from "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of complications from cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the movie legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects to deliver 215 aircraft this year, despite the looming recession, which poses a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its 2008 delivery forecast of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the 30 to 120 seat range.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the American International Group, an insurance company backed by the U.S. Treasury Department, is considering selling off more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it was owed.
AIG is prepared to direct the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pension business in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG might divest include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments, FT explains.
France Télécom continues that no final decision has been taken on these sales.
AIG must make the sales quickly to repay the $85 billion in loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk of the U.S. government getting 80% of its capital and losing current shareholders to the same extent.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out the banks: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45.
The strongest drop in points in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The final figures show that the Nasdag index, which is mainly technical, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan, which was supposed to restore some stability to the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
̋This is a bad image being circulated, which portrays Congress as unable to adopt a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
̋This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be ̋too late'.
`If the project is doomed to failure (...), it will soon be up to the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict lending conditions,' warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, adding to the sense of urgency, that every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial enterprise in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the US authorities planned to buy the bank operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures to help banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing a crisis 'not just in the US but worldwide', added FTN Financial analyst.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the Treasury in ten years have fallen from 3,632% to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the revenues in 30 years yesterday evening from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the election headquarters of both the Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this televised duel, which was to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while quite respectable, was not brilliant enough to allow him to halt his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday that puts Obama five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is clearly doing the better job.
Among the undecided voters, those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner with 39 percent of the polls, while according to a CBS poll, 25 percent of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden in his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts,' warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain never ceased to highlight his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while clearly underlining the 'naivety' of his opponent on the issues at the heart of this first televised duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he stressed several times.
̋I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president,' he added.
A point of attack that's been preached about in Republican campaign ads since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without being disturbed.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the world's image of the United States.
̋McCain still doesn't get it, Obama does, ̋ a Democratic campaign commercial this weekend accused Republicans of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis that is plaguing the ̋American down the street.
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in torrential rain for an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'workers.' ' The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans believe to be the most capable of rescuing the economy even on the brink of collapse, a clear advantage.
̋The coming week could be a turning point', estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After reiterating that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a potential energy independence for the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priorities.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are carefully avoiding questions about the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night that is extremely unpopular with the public.
`Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Youths and opposition demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening in the market square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: The dictator must step down.'
Some admit that they didn't vote at all: `What's the point if they do what they want with my vote anyway,' says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has been seen by foreign observers as being in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issuance of visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are deemed clean by election observers.
The opposition says they weren't.
̋We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting,' lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive.
If opposition members enter Parliament, it is because they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we don't reform, we run the risk of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the election process, will not recognize the election as valid.
It stresses that the turnout seems too high and that the expansion of early voting (26% of Minsk voters) has opened the way to any kind of manipulation.
`Did you notice that an election took place?' asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling station.
And there will be no more than five opposition Members in Parliament, those most likely to be in line with the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night descends again over the October Square.
President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - The Blood That Became Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice that Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the public's trust, which had been severely shaken by the blood-tainted scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
It is well known that the national blood banks managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood service were contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public discontent, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to develop guidelines to prevent a repeat of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to issue his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for managing blood banks in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to Gélineau and Krever's reports, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, only 38% of people had confidence in the blood-preservation system in Quebec, recalls Dr Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood supplies and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained the public's trust,' she says, before proudly pointing out that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr Décary is aware that 'trust is extremely fragile'.
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has been acting on the precautionary principle.
At the time, we were seeing a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we have referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that you use exclusion measures when you don't know it and when a disease is only slowly progressing, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is manifested by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
So this incident showed us that the precautionary principle we applied makes perfect sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid test (NST), which allows the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, rather than the antibodies to the virus, as was the case with previous tests.
NSTs have made it possible to shorten the incubation period between the time a person is infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, she explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
This significantly reduced the risk that certain donors could be infected without being aware of it and without being detected.
These improvements have made it possible to reduce the risk of AIDS transmission through blood transfusions to a considerable extent.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of HIV-infected blood.
` In other words, that means you would have to distribute 12 million cans of blood before someone would get HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmission to occur through a blood can.
I believe that nowadays, it is safe to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health,' says the head of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens might get into your system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through blood, appeared on Réunion Island.
We must keep a watchful eye,' Dr Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Québec must provide a safe supply and also an adequate supply.
` demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population is also affecting the blood donor network, which represents on average only 3% of Quebec's eligible blood donors. '
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of donors are rejected because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is common are barred from donating blood for a year.
` With this 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But you have to replace the members of this donor network when they get older and can't donate anymore.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is especially difficult to keep them and to get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely have time to spend an hour donating blood,' laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only preserved blood but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being placed in interim storage at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
In the umbilical cord, once considered biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
` A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
̋We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' explains Dr Décary, who describes this umbilical cord blood draw-down programme as very popular.
̋Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to this because Hema-Québec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costly programme in all hospitals in Québec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal Impact won 3-1 yesterday against the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinal series at Saputo Stadium, which included a total of goals, qualifying for the semifinal round of the USL First Division playoffs.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a goalless first half for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who got in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that in the first game of the pre-season series on Friday, Impact had defeated the Starfire Complex at Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle, 2 to 1.
In the semifinals, the Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, in the Minnesota rematch, the Thunder were able to make up a 3-1 deficit with a 4-3 victory, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 overall record.
Impact will likely face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be decided today.
In short, Kovalev's victory
The number one trio on the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panthers with a barrage of fire, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec provided two templates and Kovalev converted a pass in this victory game, the Tricolore's fourth in six preliminary games.
Kovalev scored the only goal of the entire shoot-out.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need one more game to make me feel good.
̋He was too fixated on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau remarked.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a thunderous applause.
Charest is betting on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's general assembly was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
̋Pushing the course of our last major northern border': this is the long-term objective that Jean Charest presented yesterday in visual terms at the general assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, Quebec viewed on Google Maps, maps, etc. were shown.
Big money, like during the election.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out holding elections this autumn, even though he said his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which includes an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in recent Prime Minister speeches, the opening up of the north - the northern area at 49 degrees latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was a 'jewel with enormous potential', but gave no date, investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some prospects for what more could be done: particularly on hydropower, forests, but especially in the mining sector, helped by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charest's list, the North has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This area, twice the size of France, is nearby, in Quebec.
It is not just in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed, as if to make it clear that he is seeking to realise a national founding dream.
He stressed that Quebec had grown a lot because of its links with the north: the Abitibi gold route, Quebec's technology, James Bay.
̋It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister told the press.
̋This is a traditional approach followed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the government", he said.
In addition, with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the north', he explained, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In the new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister feels that it is almost a duty to occupy this territory.
What about the local inhabitants, the Aborigines and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekinese Member of Parliament for Ungava), have already opened consultations with some 30 communities.
A Committee of Ministers headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) plays an important part, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large gathering, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs intended for human consumption
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who had been in office before him.
`Like the liberals who came before us, we have re-thinked to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's taking over as party leader.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power station into the Adélard-Godbout dam.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the quiet revolution and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who built the James Bay, our party has always known how to shape the future,' explained Jean Charest.
He referred to another conservative project, the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stresses that it is planned to be operational in 2012.
̋This is between us, but I intend to be there,' he told his party members, which drew a storm of applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is allowed by law.
He stresses that his schedule is full, however, mainly because of a Community Council mission to China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist plans, mainly of "constitutional objectives", which were adopted without further ado: the PLQ specifically demands the recognition of "Quebec's special status" in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council and to have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has been skeptical of the guidelines of the North Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the Nord du Québec introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply them.
If she had done so, we would have gone much further today', said Mrs Marois, standing with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are being held today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed support for the government's adoption of a plan North.
̋But what we want is that this is not just a big show,' said party leader Sébastien Proulx, speaking for Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A Land of Dishonor
Mr Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (ironically) in the Harper cabinet, took the liberty last summer of saying that Louise Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
This woman, who has fought a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering herself in shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which is the only one of the countries concerned which has not brought home a compatriot held in Guantanamo.
A government that doesn't even consider that Omar Khadr was a teenager when the things that he's accused of happening happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhuman conditions.
The only one who reduces herself to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are all calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult will be forever broken after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are witnessing a treacherous curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', that word that Harper is constantly carrying around like a flag and that sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily mistreated, tortured and imprisoned at the discretion of a head of government who is supported by a minority (may he be a minority after October 14th).
Many voters believe they can find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they fail to see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this resignation and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director general of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
It confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company has filed a six million-dollar libel suit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening a public transparent debate'.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they judge not by the truth, especially in cases of slander, but by the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to speak out against it.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal battles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the other side and also discourages anyone who dares to re-engage with the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of things to the public.
Contrary to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas and not by the use of batons.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had opened its books and files and opened up a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent fact-finding teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters in support of the writers of Noir Canada with a wave of the hand.
I would like to ask Mr Garver how he can simultaneously ask for a 'public' debate and ignore the opinions of this public?
It seems that in the vice president's world, that word only includes the lavishly paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a pretty narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the writers and editors of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gagging complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just issued a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, asking them to stop using the term...).
Mr. Garver's surreal speech aside, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to research and discuss issues that don't appeal to the rich corporations of the world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to curb this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Bailout for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the top congressmen, Republican and Democrat alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to end the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main themes are: better control by Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public funds used, new orders to curb the number of houses foreclosed due to late payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the companies supported.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
̋We have made great progress towards a deal that will be marketable,' declared Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
̋Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street crash,' the Democrat explained.
̋This is the basic point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,' Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had sped up over the past two hours, fearing the effect that another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who only entered the negotiations late, were more in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it had to be reached in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on adding certain provisions to the settlement, especially those designed to allow homeowners to keep their homes and those that would affect the salaries of executives of state-bailed-out businesses.
` When you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, it is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,' he declared on American television.
When asked on another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I've read [show] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is designed to use taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other forms of common bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze in financial power and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed last week in their first attempt at a deal.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of distressed societies should only be secured by the government and not bought, they think they can escape the impasse.
To round out the viewpoint for everyone in Congress, they also added a provision that says that if the government loses money on this program within five years, it can then levy new taxes to recoup its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the companies it supports, which will pay dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm passes.
The Federal Government will be able to suspend the attachment proceedings in respect of the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and to set deadlines for repayment and the severance payments to be paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
The plan's developers would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this proposal, both from the Republicans and Democrats.
̋Obviously Washington doesn't understand us,' Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
Yeah, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is asking the taxpayers to pay the tax".
Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman, head of a congressional group called the "Skeptic Caucus", puts things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask the Congress not to be pressured and to consider carefully which way to go,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have seen once again that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor, which is in serious trouble after losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
'This is not money wasted,' Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is precisely what savers and households value now that uncertain times are looming.'
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) would be real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and client accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of this financial crisis, after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with his azure eyes was long his trump card, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor, with his charming smile, freed himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and his obvious talent have probably kept him from a position of power that would bring forth the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great performer!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from complications of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the Golden Age.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he was similar and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and of breaking dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From his European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality.
Because he mirrored an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the combatant who was wounded in action in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early '50s and then went to the Actor's Studio in New York before he found success in theater, television and soon cinema.
This same civil rights activist was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans and a sex symbol, despite having been in a model relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, dedicated and oversensitive to the glamour of show business star, whose mysteries will never be fully solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has left movie buffs in a daze this weekend as all of his great roles were played out on the dark screen of memory.
More than half a century of American filmmaking in constant flux is passing with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in "The Cat on the Roof", a 1958 Tennessee Williams film.
It is a much more recent memory (1990) that is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, violent, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role originally intended for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic thug in the superb The Sting, which won the 1973 Oscar for best picture.
As a bitter and vengeful pool player in Robert Rossen 's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
This face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
His biography is a fusion of eras.
Young people know him from the cult film Slap Shot (1977) by George Roy Hill, as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' Hudsucker Proxy.
His last role was as the godfather of the Irish mob in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several movie legends who retired from the movie business early enough, Newman was to remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it, not without humor, as a living challenge to the "underplaying" when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The job wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who was a bit of a fly on the wall for a long time.
He played less-common Sunnyboys, however, as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, villains, or desperados, with whose perfect portrayal he mirrored his slippage and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, painted a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to his son Scott, who died of an overdose.
In the flood of tributes that poured over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared with great emotion:
Generosity and a sense of life were essential qualities of the late actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, is now gone.
We have probably seen him often standing with his foot in bowls of vinaigrette, sauces, cakes, or other foods, and we thought it was rather tasteless, although we found it amusing at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these phrases: `Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A model citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The accused are charged in particular with involvement in organised crime, gross negligence, damage and fraud, and other offences, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the funds raised from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often supported by false invoices.
State funds and grants from the local authority - HUF 65 million in total - are said to have been partly transferred to the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly to the coffers of private individuals.
The investigation authorities have stated that fictitious invoices were presented when the tendering fees were used and that the associations failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
The invoice blocks were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, and the circular seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was taken on that round trip north of Lake Platte to which István Lados was sent by János Tzuslag.
During this "exploration tour", Lados was to locate guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested invoices for consumption in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest based on these templates.
These bills are said to have been manipulated in the main by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, who we believe was responsible for drafting the reports.
One of the targets of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer hall.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuzlag and Co in 2003, the catering establishment was said to have hosted the 90 members of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now the manager says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors of form and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at a time, is said to have accommodated 130 guests, according to the invoice.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently no more limited than it was in the case of Pigal Kft., a catering company whose accounts, according to the prosecution, do not even contain the records of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
As the CEO Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, he immediately knew that these were fake documents when he was presented with documents by the prosecutor's office during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp".
Furthermore, apart from the formal errors, the fact that the establishment was supposed to have accommodated 100 people was also incorrect, when it has a total of 11 rooms which cannot possibly accommodate so many people.
The Commission also stated that the bill included a meal, but that the restaurant had not been in operation for some time.
The diligent counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offered trips abroad and so included Hungary trips on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practices.
As it became clear during the investigation, they also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on a total of four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company charges only 15% VAT instead of 25%, and the employees issue only automatic invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the accountants was that in one case they had indicated 'transport of goods' as a service provided, although this is not offered by the investment advisory firm, the prosecutor's office said.
Further formal errors - incorrect invoice format, incorrect stamp - were responsible for exposing the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont as forgeries.
The same applies to Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose managers claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another 'mistake' was made by the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in the process of being dissolved at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was alleged to have dined there - the warehouse manager therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Deliberately forged
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the benefit of the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also alleged to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co. In 2003, the company allegedly provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with false invoices for a total value of HUF 5 million relating to services not provided.
However, there was also little transaction as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the parties concerned forgot to record in their documents.
The third group of accountants consists of persons who are directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the mailman for the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based but unavailable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is alleged to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components worth a total of about HUF 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, acted as buyer of these invoices.
The company's managing director was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be served by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation Kubatov admitted to having issued invoices in the name of the company to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, and to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and to having collected the equivalent of these invoices himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were allegedly founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which the defendant claimed was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company's constitution documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is alleged to have issued 15 invoices to the organisations for a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecution believes Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount and the VAT each.
Kubatov is alleged to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to Biztos Pont's applications.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ('TMA') in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but misused the funds.
In order to cover this up, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works Team Kft.
These bills were, by the way, found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
The trial is now expected to include a confession by some of the accused about the practice of counterfeiting invoices, as they have already been submitted to the prosecution.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János Zuzsa, decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had promised several times to report everything in detail, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him to make good most of the damage of HUF 50 million and whether Zuschlag is prepared to assume responsibility in return.
It is quite possible, however, that Zuschlag is now playing the "offended" after his requests for relief of his detention and house arrest were ignored.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage by economic crimes and have not compensated for it are at large, or at least under house arrest, Zuschlag is denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Over-Bidding - or Why We Are Willing to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bargain.
Neuroscientists and economists at New York University have now succeeded in uncovering the neuroeconomic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people are willing to pay even higher prices in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, because they do not want to lose.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological pattern of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was asked to play the lottery while the other participated in a playful activity - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Both games offered participants the chance to win money, but the participants' striatum, a complex beneath the cerebral cortex, was shown to be more active in auction losers, where outbiding the opponent plays a major role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the nervous system's "self-reward".
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group also conducted research on the traceability of money.
In this case, three groups would have to bid against one partner on different terms.
The control group was told the true value of the product, and then they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a reward of $15 if they emerged victorious.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a losing game.
The only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on winning for one group and losing for the other.
But as evidence of the hypothesis put forward by neurologists, the members of the "losing" group were willing to bet more than those in the control or "winning" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
The reason for the behaviour observed in auctions so far has been the joy of winning or the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved by imaging neuroscience, so that we now have a third explanation". - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at 100,000 in this country, but only 7,000 are being treated, which is because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water); in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, faeces or saliva).
Vaccination against the A and B viruses is recommended for travellers, but there is no vaccine for the C virus.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Then the yellowing of the skin and eyes occurs, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery may take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-related, far more serious diseases, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that only one in ten people with the disease is estimated to be on medication.
Hepatitis C can also be serious, leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer if left untreated.
Most people infected with the disease are unaware of their illness because the pathogen is insidiously destroying liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of people with chronic hepatitis C worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory tests, it is advisable to consult your doctor at the first sign of an unknown origin.
If detected early, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, and the risk of infection and cancer is prevented.
World Hepatitis Day is celebrated on 30 September and was first organized by patient organisations worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic viral hepatitis, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith is like a "painkiller" that has already eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to investigate the extent to which belief in God affects a person's sense of pain, reported the British newspaper The Telegraph.
In the course of the rather bizarre study, 12 devotees and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
The results showed that the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
In fact, brain-scan technology has shown that Catholics can activate the part of their brain that regulates pain.
The study was the first in a research project involving philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
The experiment involved attaching a sparkling device to the left hand of the subject, which gave the electroshock.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one, a 17th-century painting of the Mother of God by Sassoferrato, and the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermes".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other paintings and was found to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were asked to look at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "safe", as if "concerned", and they felt "calm and peaceful".
While looking at the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they were looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, another participant in the experiment, said that similar effects could be produced with other powerful images, even in atheists, if only one found the appropriate photograph.
"We would have to find an image that evokes very positive feelings, like a mother or a father", says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does", says Wright.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would a high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You are what you say you are
On its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives at Google.
To skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he says, they would be missing the essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, thus moving closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in the world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of changing the world, Google is still in the early stages of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google could answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job is really right for me?" but that software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet searches record the search terms, the IP addresses from which the search was made and the pages visited.
For example, the Personalized Search introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save and access their own search history so that the results can be generated much more accurately later, and the same logic is used for the so-called "recommendations" that the system uses to recommend tailored products and services based on past preferences.
But users are wondering what happens if data is misused - "If you look at what I do" - and some are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is the fear-inducing factor, rather than guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or rebellion against power, that is the reason for many Internet users' rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties where appropriate, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent anti-pedophilia operation in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called Orkut, which also allowed the pedophiles to be identified.
However, users concerned about their privacy were able to take a break in May when Google and the civil rights organization EFF successfully sued the FBI, according to which Google can no longer be forced by any provision of the Constitution to give information to the FBI on secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but it has been withheld the list of individual users, or their web and search term lists, for two months retroactively.)
Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to give out their personal data because they fear losing their privacy and privacy by using Google services are lashing out at the company with the indignation that befits self-described conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users to provide identification codes, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems much more attractive, youthful and cooler than the software giant's official practices.
On the other hand, geeks are keenly aware of the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been brought into focus, especially in recent years, by the term "Web 2.0".
The Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, meaning that users deliberately leave their mark and use the available channels of communication, and even if the extent varies from person to person, the main thing remains the same, namely to be seen publicly.
The average teenager can manage their profile on multiple community portals at once - from Facebook to Xanga, they can connect them through other services like Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and they can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And as a series of other examples prove: looking at the party photos from the previous night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is fired for being too honest in his blog about his anger at the management of the company - one thing is certain: The concept of "privacy" has been completely reinterpreted.
The online life is what you give away - a way of saying the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And if you're trying to keep something secret, or even to get around Google's monopoly, you can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine but deliberately leaves no trace.
Many people deliberately avoid registering on community sites to avoid being found, but Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
Meanwhile, public opinion is waiting in vain for Google to show its true face.
With a current value of $156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapidly introduced services are causing headaches not only for Microsoft but also for other software developers.
Critics, however, find the opposite to worrying: for example, the company management completely rejected a protest by employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management thought that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive.
The company's internal policy is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available.However, events in the coming months and years could turn things around: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is now assuming proportions that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the stuff for the next generation of science fiction writers -- like "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow that describes in the best Orwellian way a future where humans become terrifyingly accessible thanks to data that Google collects.
Two teenagers help the Ózd double murderer to clear his tracks
Police have now questioned two teenagers in connection with the Ózd double murder, who are suspected of helping to cover tracks, police spokesman Borsod said on Tuesday.
The youngsters have confessed and are currently being charged with aid.
According to the MTI news agency, the two girls are defending themselves on their own.
The aid is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.
The suspect in the Ózd double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having murdered several people deliberately for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a property in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act from a long time ago - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The police are now working with experts to investigate the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a bid to buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
The Polish State holds 99% of the shares, but intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily E15, the Polish bid includes the highest bid ever for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have all made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis as seen by European newspapers
In their comments on the deepening international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke of a "second 9/11" on Tuesday.
The global financial disaster is due to the American president, La Repubblica said, who has not been able to get his own party behind a bill that should bring some relief to the scary situation.
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 9/11".
Parts of the press in Madrid are also tracing the scapegoat to Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the world economy now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, and it is at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored, says the Geneva daily.
It is true that some governments could still provide bailouts for their failing financial institutions and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, neither more financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to step out of their shadows and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than 100 billion euros were paid out to failing financial institutions, the Vienna-based Der Standard reports, adding that there are increasing fears that European taxpayers will have to dig deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
The EU has not yet seriously addressed the crisis, which is now sweeping the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "saviors" would not have to "swing" several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be wise to note when it would be wise to use taxpayers' money to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of bumblebees
What better way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents than to mimic the obstacle sensors of nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees to create new accident-prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system, a mini-car with bee characteristics, which is controlled by a car robot, with the aim of helping develop a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", much like our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The bee's complex eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays a vital role.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, researchers have taken up the idea of a laser-controlled rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a 180-degree field of view of 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is detected in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it were not, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, because this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield, a layer within which accidents are currently still considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a split second.
However, unlike bees, the deflection cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the tire's rotation.
While bees have endless opportunities to avoid other bees, the researchers in the car robot have been able to use only rotation, or acceleration and deceleration.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it was about the instinctive, intelligent response, less about the processing of the data, and even less about the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few inputs per second.
It doesn't have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a handful of KB of memory at a time.
It doesn't need gigabytes and megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the instantaneous collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in series production within the next ten years.
Another application of the technology could be in GPS satellite navigation, whereby the driver is deliberately guided around obstacles and thus to the destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now the draft of the $700 billion bailout bill is in place, which will be implemented in several stages and will be aimed at buying up the bad loans of the banks.
The first round is to spend half the money.
In a meeting that ended after midnight on Saturday, congressmen struggled to reach an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress", said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, adding that the agreement was only on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
The result was that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program would work and be efficient, but more needed to be done.
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened, i.e. Sunday evening at 8 pm (Central European time Monday 2 am) but did not cause a boom in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the 2008 economic stabilization bill, and then the Senate will vote.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We welcome the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme, however, deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of bad, debt-laden securities.
In a first tranche, up to half of the $700 billion will be spent, with $250 billion available immediately after Congress votes on the bill, as expected Monday, to be used to purchase bad, credit-ridden securities, and the remaining $100 billion to be decided by the president.
The programme is reviewed by a separate committee, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can also use a combination of tactics: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities, or other "toxic" loans.
According to the Ministry, the purchase can be done either at auction or directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme whereby the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds concerned and the companies pay the fees corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulsen said: The bill defines the resources needed to provide up to $700 billion in emergency relief to the American financial system, whether it be for large-scale purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a major financial institution.
We're taking the necessary steps to be ready to implement the bill once it's signed, Paulson said.
The heads of the troubled banks, now dependent on state aid, can, however, expect their settlements, known in overseas slang as "golden handshakes", to be cut by the government.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The reduction essentially means that when the Ministry buys at auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the retired bank manager is retired.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that executive salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements to get more people to participate in the program.
This is the first time in American history that cuts in managers' salaries have been mandated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee.
The State gains shareholding rights in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, who can also participate once the economy and thus the rescued bank recover.
The bill calls for the president to submit to Congress a proposal within five years on how taxpayers can recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American people expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were being pushed by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
As the Central Statistical Office pointed out, domestic sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were up by 1.1% compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9% compared to the previous year.

The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent), primarily bags and belts, which rose 4.6 percent, and shoes, which rose 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials led to a substantial increase in prices for chemicals and manufacturing (1.6%).
The price decreases were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4%), electrical and technical equipment (0.9%) and slightly in wood processing (0.1%).
Prices in the papermaking industry, as well as in publishing and printing, remained unchanged.
In other branches of manufacturing, price increases ranged from 0.2 to 0.9%.
In the main domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic markets of manufacturing industry year on year, crude oil processing prices rose the most (32.4 per cent).
The metalworking sector saw a 13.2 percent increase, while the increase in the manufacture of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5%) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3%).
The rate of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1%.
Overall, manufacturing prices climbed 10.2 percent last year.
The prices of electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
The highest price increase (0.7%) was recorded in August in the domestic market for fixed assets.
In the manufacturing sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3%, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained stable compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was observed in the energy and reuse sector (16.8%).
The consumer goods sector recorded a 6.8% increase in prices and the capital goods sector a 1.4% decrease.
Industry's export prices, measured in forints, rose by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, but declined by 3.9% year on year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, and compared with the August 2007 exchange rate, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and by 15.9 percent against the dollar.
No more visas to the U.S. from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the US-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around January 12, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "all that now depends is on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration or control system overseas".
The Commission also stressed that the new system would not allow entry, but that tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomatic service is holding negotiations in Washington from today.
She will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the Medal of Merit with Star of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain back a bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major party presidential candidates, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout of banks on Sunday, although some politicians are calling for the resignation of the Treasury secretary.
Congress and government officials announced Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout after days of marathon deliberations.
The Wall Street crisis, along with the thaw of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls have shown that Obama has been able to extend his lead on economic issues while McCain's high, which earned him the nomination of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages on consumer protection which he had supported.
"We must act now, and responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat", he told 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete".
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time dealing with this ... but certainly not doing anything is not an alternative".
The Republican senator said the plan also calls for the creation of a review board for the Treasury Secretary, as well as a limit on clearances for top executives - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the Secretary.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press release for the German-speaking area
The right wing is intact, only the voters within the camp have become more self-confident - this is how Der Spiegel comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution Destroys Its Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break with the past is a problem for Christian Democracy and Angela Merkel.
The CSU's disaster did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end that was already evident almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, during the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The CSU's systematic modernization of the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
The socialist movement has been a major force in the development of the socialist movement in Germany since the early 1990s, and it has been a major force in the development of the socialist movement in Germany since the early 1990s.
Modernization always comes with more options, and that has political consequences.
The right wing is intact - only the voters within the right wing have become more critical and stubborn.
It is striking that in recent weeks the most distant from the CSU groups have been the traditional groups: the professions, the industrial citizenship and voters with high school and university degrees.
Here, the CSU's support dropped to well below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily Daily reports in its article entitled "Who with whom? Party leaders withhold in coalition questions" about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens are not yet ready to commit to a coalition.
The new elections are over and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked at their cards.
The SPÖ leader Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is quite possible - this is already the case in some Länder and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
He said the voters had voted down the bowl-mortterer course.
I would not like to see this repeated.
But Molterer has been cautious about red offers.
He said the Commission had not yet been able to reach agreement on a common position on the proposal.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which are eligible for the aid.
The BZÖ chief, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take government responsibility", Haider said.
Járóka: The cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, the EU Council Presidency, opened in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP for the European People's Party, drew particular attention to segregation in education as one of the most serious violations of rights faced by Roma children and the biggest obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, and the most important European legal and civic organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the Fidesz MEPs' press office reports, Járóka drew attention to the fact that apart from discrimination in the job search, Roma are being pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary education and, due to a poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can obtain a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right which should play a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of EU Member States.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and sales taxes, they contribute to national expenditure.
'As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped,' says Lívia Járóka.
As the MEP explained, a common, targeted and action-oriented action by the European Union is needed to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector.
'We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,' Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the Summit has been held annually with the aim of providing a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in the spirit of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities'.
CSU: Give it time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are rolling yet, and the Bavarian CSU leadership has postponed the staff debates.
The party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein will remain in office, the only question is how long this mercy will last.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
But the much-scouted duo have already made it clear that they don't want to stick to their chairs.
The Commission is also proposing that the Council should take a decision on the application of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union was still 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only secured 43.4 percent of the vote.
The CSU was the "sole ruler" in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives will remain the dominant force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal party restructuring, Huber's potential successor, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, is also involved in the exploratory team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing Free Voters about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that the list of "Free Voters" brings Gabriele Pauli into the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber behavior the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited to then ruthlessly serve the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all their efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
The former prime minister and CSU leader called 28 September the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion the CSU should have received much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which had contributed a lot to its success in 2005 at the national level, is not put back on its feet by a joint act of force, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the loss of CSU ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and we are not going to be able to do anything about them.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
The opposition to Lukashenko: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MP made it into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers attribute this to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects irregularities in the vote count.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
The legislature of the country of 10 million people has been without opposition for decades, but the opposition party, called the United Democratic Forces (ODS), had been hoping that Lukashenko, who won a fourth term in office in a corrupt election and a constitutional amendment in 2006, would allow some opposition MPs into parliament before yesterday's elections.
The ODS has therefore even abandoned the boycotts it had planned.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia due to rising natural gas import prices. It has even taken out loans to mitigate the price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country, to the Russians.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD election evaluation report, which emphasised the positive developments rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's Rapid Report on Monday already criticized the campaign - which said opposition figures were not expected to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the vote count.
Despite this, the opposition is seeing an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, which on paper makes Ukraine a federal state, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election believes that a continuation is desirable, even though "the powerful have become afraid to allow even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in view of the results, but is rather trying to make clear to voters the need for economic reform.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are throwing stones at us to distribute them, but I see more and more people supporting the change, even the elderly", Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that even the most supported layer of pensioners does not agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the establishment of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' that resembles the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble", says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in deeds, not words".
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's own resources are used for the purposes of the common agricultural policy.
The new 'Anti-Laziness Law' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
">"Rolling doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher attendance and more services", says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,' Brunetta emphasises once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that the choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value.
There was no official opposition, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
So , all in all , no more breakfast during work hours , no more coffee or croissants .
Brunetta's advice is this: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the High School of Public Administration
The Minister of Labour, from Rome, announced that 'within three months, the number of official absences had fallen to 50%, which means that 60,000 more people were present at work per year'.
It adds that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as high as the private sector and well above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to oppose the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service is making a point of stating that absenteeism is decreasing, the number of 'active lazy people' is continually growing", says the Consumer Centre.
Indeed, thousands of decent and valuable public officials have joined together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree".
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick employee, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: 'Prevention of accidents at work is crucial'
Every day in Italy there are 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, data from the INAIL (National Institute for Labour Information) confirm that there were around 1200 fatal accidents at work.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
Today, the National Association of Migrants and Invalids in the Workplace (ANMIL) will celebrate the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents in all Italian provinces to draw attention of social institutions and the media to this tragic situation.
'The alarming data published by Anmil and the tragic news of the last few days confirm the importance of prevention in the workplace,' said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to the President of the National Association of Migrants and Invalids in the Workplace (AMIL), Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at work, to the protection of injured workers, to assistance for the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"A 'basta' of outrage has risen up against this, understandably in the case of tragedies that, given their scale, cause some media and public concern, but everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely a resource problem: there is a need to invest decisively in education and information".
The many initiatives to raise awareness directly in schools among young people entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that the phenomenon of work-related deaths was an urgent social emergency which offended the conscience of all and forced all the institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem.
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of workrelated deaths is far too high", stresses Anmil's president, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention.
"We believe that we are doing too little to tackle the phenomenon of accidents.
We believe that more controls and inspections are needed  said Mercandelli; but also more education for workers starting at school".
"More work is needed", he adds, "in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility is needed on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon which constitutes a social emergency".
Mercandelli also spoke of the "progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolishment of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to restore to the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not become dependent on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator".
MP3 player accused of damaging hearing
Long-term exposure to loud music on portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the EU CSRSERI (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks).
"The report  states in a note  that it is clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music for more than an hour a day on a weekly basis with portable music devices for at least five years are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I worry that so many young people who usually turn portable music devices and cell phones to a high volume are unknowingly damaging their hearing irreversibly", says Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific evidence shows that the EU is facing a clear risk that requires rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In the light of these scientific findings, we must review the control systems already in place to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology".
The independent scientific committee was commissioned by Brussels in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
'The scientists confirm that their concerns are justified and that the European Commission will now work with other Member States and the parties concerned to examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise emitted by portable musical and similar devices.'
The Commission has already adopted a European standard limiting the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB.
This damage can be greatly reduced by using solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of exposure.
In its report, the European Union's Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to music at a loud level (above 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, they have already exceeded the legal limits for maximum noise levels in the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit are at risk of complete hearing loss within five years.
This is 5-10% of the users of such devices, which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the Commission for the Future of the Capital
We start today, we should be done in March, we'll take stock in June.
The Commission's proposal to the Council to set up a committee on the future of the capital of Rome, which met this morning at its new seat behind the Caracalla Baths, is a step in the right direction.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 Members of the Commission will draw up guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor, Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented", Alemanno stresses. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, for which the city and municipal councils remain politically responsible.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place to develop a big project for Rome.
In March its task will be finished and the Commission will be dissolved again, because such a project must have a definite end point.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan, which will use the work done by the Commission".
To those who question the Commission's competence because its opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results  and this will certainly be the case in Rome  then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look at a longer period to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome is keen to make clear that 'This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will make us think.
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to make a qualitative leap - which it really needs - and thus take a joint step into the future".
A future, the Mayor of Rome said, which "will not be confined to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further, not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama  the first anti-American president?
A prominent American politician who is keen to be seen as independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy through his decisions and who had ties to Islam, which was hostile to him (and still does so today as a private citizen)".
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more intense, especially as the election approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on an Internet site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he's going to get the highest office in a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
But actually, these attacks don't say much; they're racist attacks, and they don't answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win by a wide margin.
Again, there are people who speak with their hearts and not their heads.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, wrote in its editorial that it is only in the ballot box that we will know who the true American patriot will vote for.
This is where a U.S. mentality comes into play that was kept hidden until the very end.
"Say what you want, and we'll decide who we're gonna make our crutches for, Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you've never heard before... only now that the black candidate's success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all this consideration, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for most the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse is also affecting journalists, as you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the printed press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the competent authorities.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to the problems are the cuts to the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the paper.
This is a problem that must be solved  according to the journalists interviewed  if traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, is not to be allowed to shrink significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is what fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the print media think that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local sector, it is even 65% for executives.
Printed versus broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to imagine where the web is going.
The major publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which many consider the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it will bring something good to journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, compared with only 23% at local level.
Some people think it has to do with "workplace safety".
The proportion of managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years is 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The issue of "safe working" in the team (our "editors") is always a hot topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as they please and so it becomes a take it or leave it question.
The editors-in-chief are often paid very high salaries, while the editor can sometimes earn only 10,000 euros a month, plus pensions and insurance benefits.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, but I am not sure that we can accept them.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often get "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has decided that the Court of Justice of the European Communities shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal proceedings.
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-contract in the case of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residency in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
The Court held that such transfers (which the prosecution had opposed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain incriminating evidence.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was already apparent a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House's $700 billion austerity package: a large part of the American people were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times report on how the ongoing crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured government institutions and the business community, and the neoconservatives who are hostile to those in Washington and the financial world, and are winning voters, especially in the South and the center of the States.
This part of the party owes its rise mainly to the voice of the man I mentioned above.
The example just given is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake is heralding or even already representing: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond.
The crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events which are finally taking shape and coming to light in these new conditions, both in the States and in Europe.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state, combined with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is in fact a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with the outside world and at the same time manage a huge amount of the assets of households living in a single country.
This poses a direct political problem for governments: how to deal with the families involved, who are also a huge mass of voters.
The crisis is thus economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been sidelined and lost its right to speak: the EU, which is divided into various national and international conflicts and cannot find a common path, has provided a clear example of this.
The European Union is now facing a crisis in which the United States is the only country in the world that can survive without foreign aid.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, but I am not sure that we can accept them.
The new emphasis on the national element is also in perfect harmony with the increasing importance recently attached in the economy to a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we had long ago entered a world of interconnectedness, a world of ever more differentiated technologies, of the intangible, that we suddenly have to realize how our future will depend more and more on the essentials of the material: water, crops and oil.
While all of these can be transported from one place to another, they are still at most bound to a narrowly defined piece of land  a territory.
Thus, one who has such a territory has an advantage over another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I shall now turn to the second new feature, which, however, requires a short delay.
When you say territory, when you say government, when you say politics, you mean leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there's the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, the need for someone who knows how to run things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation at the existing leadership, especially the economic leadership, which has proved inadequate and full of shadow zones.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so in the near future.
It seems that the conviction is being formed among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but also their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is increasingly alien and superstitious to the majority.
The demand for leadership is thus fuelling underground a branching but powerful movement to disempower the ruling class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in unforeseen "riots" by voters and the sudden shift in collective mood of recent times, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, and the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role).
It seems as if the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their magazines, their intellectual believers, some would say their format, have more and more problems understanding and therefore less representative value in relation to what is happening in the lower social strata of the West today, and this is being exacerbated by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply an exaggeration to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes peeled is not.
The Super Glue That Blows Up Walls
Defeat the forces of gravity with a glue and climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to be close to its goal.
Using a piece of glue applied to a surface of just one square inch, researchers have been able to fix a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
The study, published in the journal STUDIO, published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the gecko's feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect grip.
Tests with materials such as Teflon glass and sandpaper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the grip of the reptile's feet and "easily removes it from the wall", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking about a less fascinating use, like connecting electrical devices, because nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in the field of space.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH  Also at the University of California, Berkeley, a new type of glue is being studied.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, scientists in California present a glue made of microfibers that, like hair, cleans itself of dust by moving on a surface, thus maintaining a perfect bond.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on their absorption by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly warned of the risks of packaged and fresh fruit juices when they are used in connection with medication, and at the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia he warned that one glass of apple, orange, or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital medications to the point of virtually eliminating them, putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medications, including antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
DANGERED MEDICINES  In a report two years ago, the same agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture and urged them to be careful about what they drink in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or methadone.
It's not just grapefruit. Experts say that orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit medications.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately communicated to the various international manufacturers, who are free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package insert and, if there is still confusion, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor", stresses the expert from the ANSA agency.
The Nobel Prize in economics is going to Paul Krugman .
The Nobel Prize in Economics is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activity.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular columns in the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for U.S. history than the attacks.
A prediction that was met with controversy and was still being made by the economist years later, but which is now proving to be absolutely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals surrounding the collapses of Enron and Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, the third version of the anti-Microsoft package is released.
The day has come for the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source software that is gaining a growing number of users as a free replacement for Microsoft Office, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, overseen by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now being presented with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more spartanly designed start menu, it is now finally fully compatible with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
The Commission also noted the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
There are also some new features, such as the ability to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send them via email, and the ability to import PDF files into graphics modules while maintaining the original look and feel of the page.
This is how "hybrid" PDFs can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to include the elements of a spreadsheet and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple users, avoiding conflicts of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question to guarantee a better proofreading process.
Some companies are in the process of releasing various OpenOffice features on the cloud, while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
The program is available for Windows and Mac OS, as well as the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or office.
While the free of charge feature may be an incentive for the spread of the software in private households, it is also in the business sector where OpenOffice could make a big leap: after all, several public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even lacking in training, which is an optimal aid for small and medium-sized enterprises and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-compatible text editor; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations like with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more popular Access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is 5 million downloads, a target that can be easily exceeded with 3.6 million already achieved.
Kohl also tested positive, making this the fourth doping case.
A new doping case has been opened in the context of the last Tour de France: it concerns the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who finished third and won the trophy for best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to test positive for Cera, the third-generation EPO, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those taken in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be banned from racing for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive test, and the Associated Press reported that Austrian authorities were also informed.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed to the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the best climber jersey for himself.
The New York Times asks: "Is Italy racist?"
Italy, "the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the countries of choice for immigrants", who are only reluctantly accepted.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? asks the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young man of Burkina Faso origin, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a packet of biscuits.
The case illustrates what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are where "the most integration and job opportunities exist", yet "the highest levels of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and to expedite the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A move that the Pope and the President of the Republic also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State in the fight against racism".
Students are victims of high room rents of up to 900 euros
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious forms: whole groups of students are effectively losing their right to study because their families are not able to support them at this level", says Laura Mariani, head of Sunia.
In addition, most rental offers contain a number of violations: free contracts, no registration, no rent limit, unauthorised subletting.
Sunia believes that exceptional measures are needed to reduce rents by revising the tax system.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan, a place to sleep in the Brianza district costs about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the university districts, a bed costs 250/280 euros, a single room 370-500 euros.
In Rome, prices in the university districts are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double room.
The rent is only slightly lower in the neighbourhoods around the other universities in Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid the suburbs can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples, you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest towns, prices are lower, but they have a greater impact on the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% above average are demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso  the cities are closing their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas are closing due to the multiplex cinema concessions.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
This image by director Giuseppe Tornatore is a powerful description of what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-screen complexes in the periphery, means the death in the long run of the single-screen cinema in the centre.
The film, which won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix at Cannes 20 years ago, tells the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia for a world that has been lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, the huge number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close, largely due to the closure of cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions that have registered the largest number of these modern cinemas: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy tops the list, 81 being in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "While it is useful that new structures are also being built, the priority is to preserve the existing one, because when a cinema in the city closes, not all its regular customers are ready to go to a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
It is a shame from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between EUR 16 and 18 million a year to survive.'
The first Italian city to decide to protect its old cinemas through an agreement between the municipality and Anec, the first such agreement in Italy, is Bologna, which is the first Italian city to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for cinema operators and local public transport benefits: access to restricted areas of the centre and parking at lower rates.
'It is a welcome initiative,' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope that other cities will follow our example and come up with new concepts.
But we certainly need better audio and video equipment to counter the superpower of multiplex theatres, because today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been toying with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
Links between politics and the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The charges brought by the anti-mafia office of Calabria against the mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer who shares the same name as the clan's boss, were also handcuffed.
"In defiance of any moral or legal norm", the lawyers write, "the two local authorities decided to pay Piromalli a fee for consulting".
"This made it possible for the mafia group  the judges  to enter the town halls by official means and to influence the policy of the public administration".
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabria Regional Committee, does not deny that in his region "it is far from an exception to encounter links between local authorities and organised crime".
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest".
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, when the police said the Piromalli Clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991  and also then, local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices because of alleged links between organised crime and the local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 general election.
He shouted outrage when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He then accused Vice-Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti of having invented everything for strategic reasons, but the judges said that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A wiretap in connection with the investigation into the Dal Torrione case showed a willingness to accommodate the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large Piromalli group , making the actions of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan.'
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly come running.
It's an unquenchable source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is looking at, and also trying to occupy, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years, and it is no accident that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
The idea of marine energy was abandoned when the price of oil plummeted around 1980, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energy produced by ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy produced by nuclear power plants today.
And then there are the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to switch to offshore energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies in the traditional energy sector are now turning to marine energy.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies", says a spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering working with us".
It is about getting the approval from the U.S. Energy Commission to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially when one considers that Alaska is the one where oil is still extracted by the United States and President Bush only recently started the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also investing in the new industry, although the details are not known, but observers say there is growing interest.
There are still technologies to improve.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been cleared.
So far, projects such as the one in Portugal and also in Scotland have been rather small in scale and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, large-scale energy production requires technologies with a much greater environmental impact.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure inside the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The current is then sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
The Commission has already proposed four such plants, which are still awaiting government approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, meanwhile, is already generating power for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The water moves during the tides to power the turbines, which, through the resulting rotation, feed the generator.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
The Institute for Electricity Research says that the potential of tides is of particular interest at the moment.
Although irregular, tides are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight, and waves, and thus a more reliable source of power.
It is tidal energy that has led states like New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest $7.5 million in 2008 -- up to $35 million is planned for 2009.
