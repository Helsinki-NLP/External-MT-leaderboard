Last minute move?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big move.
Next chance won't come until winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech national team for the game against the Americans and then also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifiers against the Netherlands.
Chelsea have a new Premier League goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, who has been promoted to the reserve team for the first time in 10 years.
There was some speculation a while back that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
They lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atlético at the start of the season and failed to make the league when they lost 2-4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He entered the French league season with two wins and two draws, Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively speaking, the most boots are pushed by AS Monaco.
He's 1-1-2 in the league and he's been a bit of a draw with Lille this weekend.
News broke on the English tabloid sites today that Czech might be wanted at Queens Park Rangers.
But according to the English bookmakers, a last-minute departure from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet has a 4:1 on it.
Peter, is it possible that you could change your shirt in the few hours that you have left?
I don't count on it, but nothing's ever 100% in football.
Maybe during the day, an offer will come that you can't refuse.
What would an offer like that look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what an offer you can't refuse actually looks like.
It would have to be agreed by all parties, and it would depend on Chelsea's attitude to whether or not the club would consider an offer.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a transfer when you're in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new office?
I haven't thought about it.
But in a situation like this, there's a lot of players today, they're all at a national team meeting somewhere, and I'm sure there's a lot more transfers to be closed today.
So it would be feasible somehow.
How many clubs on the planet could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing for a leave?
The situation where I didn't catch a pass in the first three games of the season is a new one for me after 15 years of playing.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack up and go away.
I want to continue to be in the running for the Chelsea goalkeeper position and it's up to the coach who he chooses what decisions he makes over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I'm taking all the factors into account.
I'm interested in the sporting side of things, but I'm also interested in the personal side of things, which includes the needs of my family.
Is it possible you could catch for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer to that.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on his first major visit since winning the election in May to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
The list includes, first of all, plans for greater cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
According to the sources, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karratha arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it was traveling 75 miles per hour in the 70 km/h speed limit zone and then drove into the bush to escape the officers.
Patrol traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle at a crossroads this morning when they noticed it was traveling 75 miles an hour on its way out of a gas station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the driver didn't stop and continued down Burgess Road and then turned into the bushes, which caused officers to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to stop and reckless driving.
He'll be in court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was impounded for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man is about to stand trial on charges of raping women at two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was made aware of the charge during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent.
Webster is also wanted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a date for the hearing on November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
A renewal of the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.
"The way unions work, middle-class jobs work", says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to present, along with the exemplary John Lewis, a bill to empower employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation as other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-union forces from
The amendment of the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join a trade union to sue in civil court - and to seek compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other billmakers are putting forward is to re-engage with the American ideal.
Despite the labor struggles that have occurred in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country at once promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toya would be replaced by democracy.
They believed that workers and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, incorporated language into them, and openly recognized that the workers' right to assemble, bargain and act collectively was guaranteed.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and advocate in the new nation, and so they included a clause that explicitly stated: The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Any arrangement which restricts or seeks to impair this right shall be annulled.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is imperative that we return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and advocate in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but have expanded it.
They raised the living standards of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised manufacturing to unimaginable levels.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation - is lagging behind.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that lifted America up and made it the true promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers said would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
An ordinance signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to take effect on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain such permission in the meantime.
"The applicant will be able to legally conduct his business and obtain a permit in the meantime", states the order from federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month so the judge can issue a more permanent ruling regarding the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's ruling assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a treacherous law designed to deprive them of their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is suing on behalf of three of the five clinics seeking a stay of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics that were not among the applicants and also requested this authorisation.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such provisions unconstitutional.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women's rights advocates, along with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such permission places medical demands on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion have argued that the measures are designed to protect women's health, and some have also welcomed the fact that the measures would close clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights reports that only one licensed abortion doctor in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing them for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who performed abortions while waiting for a license application to be processed.
Because of late diagnosis and poor treatment, ovarian cancer is more common in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent survived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Smaller study: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the women's chances of survival were affected by their age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socioeconomic status.
The lowest survival rate was seen in older women diagnosed with advanced cancer.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that late diagnosis and poor access to treatment may be factors.
"The disease is best treated by gynaecologists, who are usually based in larger cities", she said.
Despite improvements in distance health services to overcome the distance barrier, she suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to home and support programs for people who are receiving treatment away from family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said that the study found that long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old young mother named Elisha Neave, from the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centers Regret Reducing Homeownership
According to a study by HTA published by the Financial Times, the drop in the number of homeowners under 35 could mean that by the time today's younger generation of consumers reach the "mainstream" age of gardeners, garden centres will lose up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent out their homes spend on average 55% more on their gardens than people who live in their homes.
Other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, include the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the preference for paving instead of yard use as a parking space, and the shrinking size of gardens.
The Greater London area, where the share of homeownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, has the lowest expenditure per household on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have stated that living in a sublet or having little space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at the RHS, said: Tenants are very keen to grow plants in flower beds - they can take the plants with them when they move.
The HTA report revealed that the Golden Age of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005, and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecast higher sales this year, thanks to better weather following adverse conditions in March and April.
When an Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin at a meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of the Hitler Youth, greased the atomic weapons and basically made everyone know that he didn't care about their opinions, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be controlled by both rampant nationalism and the fact that they can transform inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to flow differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought the era of wars for domination of Europe was long gone, the East thought they had been neglected for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
This was the mood and frustration in Germany in the 1930's, just before the Nazi takeover, and then followed by a nationalist explosion unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the perfectly consistent cult of the strong leader, beating up journalists, eliminating uncomfortable political opponents, discriminating against minorities and homosexuals, it's certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russian people, I think miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half was trembling.
Maybe the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe Vladimir didn't get a lot of pat on the back, maybe he wasn't invited where he wanted to go, maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just kept acting like a typical Russian man.
He cleaned up his house, pretended he didn't want to go anywhere, and he was sharpening knives at home.
Now he's decided to regain his lost position.
He's starting slow, he's got time.
The Führer's probably on life, so where's he going?
He's got the Caucasians, now he's got the Ukrainians, now it's the Baltic dwarves.
They've been biting the Russian bear's fur long enough.
I'm sure China will notice, too, because they're kind of jumping up and down and probably have a soft spot for the Far East.
And those Germans are really pissing off Vladimir about how good they are, and we gave them a good ass-kick in '45.
How about we build a new Novorossiya in the Charles Vary?
That would be a base and there's a lot of us there and they're being oppressed and they've tried to tear down any of them.
Our veterans still remember what it was like in Czechoslovakia.
Well, that's their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, he's so soft, you can peel him like an onion and eat the whole of their EU.
That would be a game to jump on the great Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And we'll use our own people living on their land as the triggers.
There are plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they're just being oppressed, and we're not gonna let that happen, we're gonna protect them.
And Russia will rule again , for what else is born .
Europe is only good as a stage for Ivan to dance the Cossack.
Turkey has summoned an American diplomat over a spy report.
The Turkish foreign minister has called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain a report on American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US chargé d'affaires and Turkish government officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by a former National Security Agency analyst suggested that Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said all major states were watching each other.
An earlier report that German intelligence was also targeting Ankara provoked a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones has introduced another trick of the fourth series
The makers of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes for the fifth season of the cult TV series.
They also bragged about how the fourth-row tricks were created.
Most obvious are the computer-generated adaptations of the series' environment and the mass scene where a band of soldiers becomes the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented to the Mallorca State Prosecutor's Office evidence of extortion by police and civil servants at the town hall in the Calvia municipality.
The police chief of Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations made by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office of extortion by police and civil servants at the town hall in the autonomous region of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish State Police in connection with corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted disgruntled nightclub owners as saying that the public authorities' preferences are having a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving", one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist performing oral sex on 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the number of drunkards and rioters at holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcohol tours of bars.
In addition, the Playhouse, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000) together with the tour organizers of the Carnage bars.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is popular with Britons in particular, has also seen many accidents involving alcohol, including a fad known as balconing, where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that affected the flight at Adelaide Airport
A PRIMER spring brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds that seriously affected Adelaide Airport.
Another 5mm of rain is expected in the city until 9pm and another 6.6mm overnight on Sunday.
The latest rain came along with several short bursts of storm surge and gusty winds that began just before 8 p.m. and brought nearly a quarter inch of rain in about ten minutes.
After a few early spring showers after a winter last week, temperatures in the city plummeted again to just 15.8 degrees on Monday.
Stormy weather is believed to have contributed to the delay of Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but a change in wind speed or direction at a short distance forced it to delay its landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at the time reached a speed of about 30 miles per hour on the ground.
Flight data showed the plane must have dropped off the second landing and finally arrived at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused delays to other flights including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
Temperatures are forecast to reach a high of 16 degrees Celsius in Adelaide on Tuesday, with one or two showers possible.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as their homes were hit by rockets and mortars during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas.
The opening of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel that were marked by the attacks, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of a kindergarten that was hit by a rocket have removed debris from the wall and are slowly waiting for the children to return.
"We are a little scared, but otherwise we are excited", said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Saad Kibbutz and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routines.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that it's a little strange to suddenly go back to school.
"We've had some rough times and we haven't left the house at all", she said.
A kibbutz near the Gaza border was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar rocket killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The education minister said that about a dozen families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard, adding: "We will provide you with education and security".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite peace deal last Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas' demands to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians have died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence to support these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza radicals have fired 4,591 rockets and mortar rounds into Israeli cities during the fighting, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army has launched more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in a hundred UN schools that have been turned into makeshift shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting raging, school officials postponed the start of the new school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like Jewish children and other children in the world", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
Willow on the meeting: I'm behind you.
And Lafat is suffering from a fever
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon today for Wednesday's preliminary match against the United States and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands.
Of the 23 players, the Spartan striker David Lafata is in trouble, suffering from fever.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's probably still having some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible", coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether he will be fit in two or three days or tomorrow will depend on his condition, which our doctor will decide", he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in Wednesday's game against the United States", the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called in the last Spartan midfielder, Lukas Vach.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, as other midfielders were also considered.
I made my decision based on the fact that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it", said Vrba k Váchovi.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latatou.
It is possible that in case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
For example, the weekend saw a brilliant performance from Liberec, Josef Shural, who scored a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing some form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata does.
If he is not available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I cannot nominate any of the players who have impressed in the Czech league", Vrba said.
This afternoon, the national team will train at Strahov, and on Tuesday, the classic pre-game practice before the U.S.A. Duel at Summer, which will be open to the fans, followed by an autograph ceremony.
The game against the Americans is Wednesday at 8:15 p.m. and the national team will be looking for a first-ever victory under the Willow.
In his last three preliminary matches, he has drawn two and lost one.
The qualifier against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9th, 8:45 p.m.
The Dutchman goes on foot to Italy
Willow is glad to have more time to practice than in previous meetings.
There's an advantage to having players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we might not have had that much time to do before.
Now we can only focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best we can", praised Vrba.
The Dutch will be in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the fight.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have the fight on tape and discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there will be", Vrba said of the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to highly-regarded statistics, winter house prices have risen the most in seven years.
According to the RP Capital's Core Data Logic Hedonic home value index, house prices rose 1.1 percent in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August of 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase reached 10,9%, more than doubling in the one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne were leading the market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices increasing on average by between five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was hit by a government-imposed cost cut and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
Given the continued high auction sales rate, the generally high sales rate and low interest rates, it is likely that house values will rise further over the next three months, he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never touched me.
He never said "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in a factory.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of a Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is upbeat.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through extensive therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew so little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop that noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a kid, they were grown up -- would go to the bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket shot.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Henry recently visited the foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he got a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
It's a little bit brighter today, but it's still a dark, smoky, murky maze, with flames bursting out and a lot of smoke and ash.
Dad would always get in the tub and just lie there, and then you could hear him slowly singing to himself, because he was washing the foundry out of him.
As I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to feed his family, and I started to respect him more.
Yet Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad, no one hugged anyone, no one said "I love you".
It wasn't until Mom was sick and dying that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you" shit?
Don't keep hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
He and French, who he was married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and I started to show symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said, "You have to make a radical change".
So I started going to a big gym and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat a carrot.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
It was followed by Comedy of Errors and The Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy work life.
He started when he was 16 and working in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television".
He was studying on the move.
In addition to being in the public eye, I had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make jokes that worked, how to be a star and how to be on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in the New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the rights to a stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment show in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry ended up performing in it for five years.
My family was already embarrassed about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on the big stage and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was for years and years the most acclaimed staple of British television, but was also a grotesque parody of black people.
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, presenting characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known for his role as Chef Gareth Blacklock on the sketch comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him to commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his show LennyHenry.tv aired on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it kind of looks like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little bit off track".
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was worried about that.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said, "You should try it".
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had delivered 20 lines of Othello's closing speech for the documentary and was already in the middle of it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
Like it gives me courage.
It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lines, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was tough, and I had been reading the play for months before that.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in for a rough patch, which they weren't.
He soon started acting in Comedy of Errors.
I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed".
There was a technical glitch and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for keeping the audience entertained.
A voice in my head said, "Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now".
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would resume once the problem was resolved.
I walked off stage and something inside me was like, "Hmm, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
You're acting, so stay in the role.
Henry in the Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words to the Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God saying, "This is what you should do".
Of course, he says it out loud.
So I'm sticking with that.
I really like it.
I like the lab.
Henry, however, remains the comedian's brain - interrupting our conversation with humorous performances all the time, when he comes in and out of the role of impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-up because getting the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you keep looking for something, you can end up in a dead end.
Sometimes I do Live at the Apollo when I want to, but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I asked if he'd ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps outline the beginning, middle and end of a journey -- I don't think I ever want to give that up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think I did.
I like acting.
It's fun. I mean,
You're always telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shed light on missing employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants in an attempt to remove non-existent government employees from the payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register within the next two weeks will not be paid.
The government believes that thousands of people continue to receive their salaries after leaving the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the public administration.
An audit this year showed that the state was losing at least $1 million a month in non-existent staff salaries and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts after an employee dies or leaves the government, said BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital Nairobi.
All government officials must report to identification centers within the next two weeks to have their biometric data recorded, the government said in a statement.
He also says that anyone who doesn't show up without a proper apology will be removed from the payroll.
By identifying the actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of missing staff, said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "plotting against the government"
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of conspiracy against the government.
The police department has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 senior officials were among those detained.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after summer vacation.
This day is traditionally important for families and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
He told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held the traditional September 1 ceremony.
Not all of Ukraine is at peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavyansk that Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children donning embroidered shirts, bringing balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for tough times.
He brings with him a cloud of fame from the worlds of banking, media management and the inner circle of the Conservative Party.
She's got experience on the front lines.
She began her career at consulting firm Bain and Co, then moved on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was the chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a junior colleague took over the top job at Pearson's parent company.
They say her severance package was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former CEO of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became an adviser to the government office.
Her husband is a former city councilman.
In May, I described the director's job as a poison cup.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inward at the top of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also outward at the voice of the public in times of unrest when things are not working.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
But what kind of CEO would risk coming into a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and losing his job?
It's a tough call.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC reduced - its power, its finances - and its status revised.
With competition widening and new technology challenging old assurances, the immediate negotiation of licence fees carries great risk for the BBC.
For a modest £145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is certainly the world's largest media company.
The BBC has a good story: they say that it reaches 96% of households and costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC's popularity is clearly on the rise, to 53% of its subscribers, up from 31% a decade ago.
The BBC's usage patterns have changed: Today, I can see the headlines on my mobile phone and watch the shows I missed on my iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs a great director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims he didn't approve of the offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account posted on Sunday contained an offensive image of a Democratic state attorney who initiated criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, distancing himself from the previous one.
An unauthorized tweet was left on my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and have taken it down", he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't immediately respond to the messages with questions.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet posted a non-flattering, humorous image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay her office fees, which landed Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption on the tweet read: "I don't always drive with three times the legal alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation into Perry wasn't run by Lehmberg's office.
He was being handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the charges because using the law to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has suspended payments of $7.5 million from the state fund for the Travis County-based Public Interest Defender's Office, which prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal prompted a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active, and he's sometimes a celebrity.
After finishing fifth in his Iowa presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to speculation that he might be retiring by tweeting a picture of himself running by a lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is returning to normal.
One of London's most prominent property developers warned that the housing market in the south-east of England had returned to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about a credit bubble led the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley-based high-end client development company, said on Monday: Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak in 2013. He adds that this provides a stable environment for operations.
London's housing market prospered during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to the Census Bureau, prices in the city have jumped 18.5% in the last year alone, far outpacing the 6.7% average in England and Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley has risen by about a fifth in the last year, to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, with the strengthening pound, London property has not been as attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "head office tax" that politicians have come up with ahead of next May's general election.
London real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for lending, would also slow the pace of growth in the second half of the year in property sales and prices.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in mortgage approvals for July, suggesting the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has cut its 2015 forecast for London property prices to 3% on the basis that house prices have already started to fall.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes in London's most expensive boroughs, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have fallen by a quarter each year, according to real estate firm WA Ellis.
Yet the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it increased the cash for the forward sale to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, good looking housing in a good location has remained the same and this has kept forward selling going".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis peaked in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to £380 million, revenues by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said that Berkeley's annual earnings are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley stocks have stopped at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
A hacker posted naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet.
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Pictures of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claims to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were authentic and criticized the hacker for "a blatant violation of privacy".
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly obtained the photos, which were originally posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, through a vulnerability in Apple's iCloud Internet storage system.
It's unclear how many of the photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are looking at photos taken years ago in the privacy of my husband and I are happy with yourselves", Winstead tweeted.
Victoria Justice, known for her appearances on Nickelodeon's cable series iCarly and Victorious, denied the photos were real, tweeting: These alleged nude photos of me are TRUE, people.
Better cut it in half.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday night that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photos were real.
An extraordinary sample from Howard Jacobson 's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter J
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only now and then, a woman tells him he's too serious, complicated, violent, isolated and maybe a little impulsive.
And then she shook his hand.
You admitted it late.
He could prick like a hedgehog, yes.
The final victim of his ability was an on-going love affair that more than usual promised to relieve his lonely boredom and perhaps even provide some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with wild hair and a flighty heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who had inherited an estate in a damp but beautiful valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
The house hasn't been lived in for years.
The pipes were leaking, the tubs were full of dead spiders, the snails were signing on the windows like they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown and the weeds looked like giant cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage from a children's story, terrifying and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Profile of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel J is on the shortlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning into the public radio station that supplied the countryside with comforting music and reassuring news, as the sight of her tan crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with his blinds drawn.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play songs like that on the radio anymore.
They weren't banned -- there was really nothing banned -- they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the desuetudo, as did the word desuetudo itself.
Popular taste has done what regulations and outlaws could never do, and just as people choose books for their memoirs, cookbooks and love stories, so in music they choose ballads.
Cavern let himself be swept away and began to play an imaginary piano and in a rough, comical voice, he sang a serenade to Aileen's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller", he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter "J" before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
If you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth for a word that started with a J, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, although not outlawed, didn't play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
When the melody started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability was getting on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in song.
Although he didn't hear of Sammy Davis Jr. until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to tell Aillin that Fats Waller was black.
She couldn't remember a time when her favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or coercion, either.
A permissive society is one in which every part of it, with gratitude - with gratitude of those who were lucky enough to be spared - agrees to the principle of group gratitude.
Afro-Caribbean people with temperaments and constitutions threw for fun and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, who seem to have a natural talent for electronics, have taken responsibility for ensuring that no family is without a working phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed were dishwashers.
Those in the Gulf and Levant states whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country while the event was taking place - afraid of being accused of starting a fire, afraid that the fire would consume them next - opened up restaurants where they sold labneh and smoked water pipes, ignored themselves and were slowly consumed by inactivity.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had only been listening to ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the dirty words that Kavern was just singing to her could have become music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really stupid", said Kevern.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My dad never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Beyond the soundproofed leaves, not a word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny", he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, obscuring Kevern's view.
All over the wide world, there was nothing to see but the blossom of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so", she said doubtfully.
Still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not the feet.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate?
That's not true, man.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her I love you, but it was too soon.
Your fat ankles are just pulling me in.
I'm a little bit of a pervert.
It didn't work.
He was trying to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Cavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from the sofa, dropped the radio and spilled the unadulterated wine.
It's a wine without the wine, so it's not the drinking.
She looked as if she were shaking in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm perversely attracted to you being an asshole", she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He was sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear in her eyes the moment she confronted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold Northern Hemisphere where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was basically the same there as here.
The same wide, icy ocean was crashing down on them.
The same deranged men, after what had happened, even more insensitive and angry than their forebears, smugglers and corrupt, roamed from pub to pub in anger, ready to lay hands on any woman who dared to reject or ridicule them.
What a fool!
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
"Oil it first" - "Oil it" became the most common term for erotic arousal between a man and a woman: the antidote to the dull love ballads that radio was spitting out - "Oil it first, then kill it".
In Kevern's opinion, too much cultivation, because the petting was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons nonverbally suggested he leave.
He got up out of bed like an old man.
She felt bitter, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave, as if from a window upstairs, a man who had been overtaken, who had caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was heavy for him and for all men in general, no matter how few beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hanging, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
Some 20 years after the events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher at Ofnow, the non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, wrote a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate violence in areas of the country where it is most likely to be reduced or stopped if enough money and energy is spent to eliminate it.
"Much has been done and much more must be done", she wrote, "to calm the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the backwoods, hard-to-reach places of the country where, despite the towers of churches towering over hedges, the breath of human kindness has historically rarely been felt".
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
While residents sigh over sentimental ballads, swallow up sad stories, and profess a strong belief in the value of marriage and family life, not only is the old brutality as stubbornly maintained in rural areas as it is in urban areas, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, on the streets, and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to have a flowery style", said her supervisor.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum has lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't feel I need to answer that", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
We've again waived our right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking", Rabinowitz said at last, "because I have something against atheists or lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve a nonpartisan society.
But a certain kind of sensitivity, which is in itself perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment, as you have shown.
You are obviously biased against the church yourself - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" might also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural force and energy.
Keeping up with what happened, if it happened, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, prepares the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was speaking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head, a light flashed in pink on the bulb, a recommendation Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter century or so.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, have a conversation, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, singing is better than writing, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations", replied Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she was sure her superior was finished, "and I'm not saying the wound didn't heal the way we're telling ourselves it did.
My main concern is that if we're not warned, we'll repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, if it happened.
But this time, we're not gonna vent our anger and distrust on anyone else.
Luther Rabinowitz has joined his fingertips.
That was supposed to be infinite patience.
"You go too far", he said, "when you describe steps that your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You're also going too far in talking about letting out your anger and distrust of others.
I don't need to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past and preserving the present, we're not talking about us and them.
There were no "We"s and there were no "They".
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
During which, if we're being honest with each other, we've gathered the courage to say that no one is without fault.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
There's nothing more to say - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault to be blamed, there are no things to be corrected, even if correction were appropriate and possible.
But what good is the past but to teach us?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I may add something to that -
Luther Rabinowitz has untied his fingertips.
"I will consider your report", he said and dismissed her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in a manner that bystanders described as "brutal and furious".
Accidents happen.
The Lesotho army says there is no coup - the prime minister stays in South Africa
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied staging a coup to overthrow the government, and claim that police were being targeted by suspects in an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country, saying the army has surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he had received death threats, the prime minister left with his family for neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it was not a coup but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the Kingdom of Lesotho's Defence Force Command has acted after receiving several reports from the intelligence services that there are several groups within the police force planning to arm some radical political fanatics who were planning to cause havoc in the country", he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"While no one claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be coup d'état", he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was calm.
During Thaban's absence, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that he believed he was being targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliament due to internal strife, tensions have been high in Lesotho.
He said that despite claims to the contrary, his actions did not undermine the government.
Euro area output at 13-month low
The closely monitored survey showed that euro area output growth slowed to a 13-month low in August.
The final euro area purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in June.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been cut and factories have been damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday .
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the euro area's delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
Speculation has emerged that ECB President Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the UK and US did during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the dampening effect of a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more visible", said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There's concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the growth driver in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring", Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August production report from purchasing managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing".
He added: "Manufacturers in the euro area are currently facing a very difficult time, as rising geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainty has demonstrated a trade impact - in particular consumer confidence - which is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially high-value orders.
He said that it 'seems even more likely' that the ECB will eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, although we expect it to be limited.
Ten years of Beslan survivors' hell: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific Beslan school bombing that killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night, surviving heroes warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists kidnapped and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy has united East and West, leading to action and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who had escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted adversity even though the memory of the hell the terrorists caused will live on in them.
What's their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - should be over.
Girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov, trying to get back into a bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
A confused Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, now in her forties.
There was a fear that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't", Aida said at the time.
My feet were bleeding.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several operations, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
I got shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it", she said firmly.
It just happened to me and I can't change it.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed behind.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate Jeru Gapoeva was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little and we used to imagine going to school together.
I don't want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her captivity, but the memories fade a little bit with each passing year.
I'm glad so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we've received from the UK and other countries.
When I look at a picture of me on the Internet of myself climbing out of a school window, I think, "A lot of people will see this for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from happening again".
A boy who escaped a hail of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at seven) and he survived the three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand".
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run".
He was afraid she was dead, so he ran and saw the toddlers crying on the road, he took the child by the hand and they were running with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead".
She says, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was asking for her freedom and was lying in the hospital with a wounded leg, thinking her son was dead.
After they met again, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the now defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it", he said yesterday.
But I can tell you, the memories are fading.
I remember throwing all my guns away right afterwards.
But now I can play video games that have shooters, and I have no problem with that.
I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or they died.
We'll say they stayed at the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could pick anything I wanted at the toy store and how I drove a convertible.
But now he worries about places like Ukraine, where they're suffering from war just like he and his friends suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel so sorry for everyone who has to go through this horror", says Damir, who volunteered at the monastery last week.
I want to help so bad.
I want to be a police officer someday and I hope to get into the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 kids in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence immediately after the attack, there were no kids screaming and running around, and it was quiet for months.
He vividly remembers the trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a bad taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, and Damir was shooting them with a water gun and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised at how willing the British were to share our pain and how supportive they were.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something they listen to on the news when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up to be a kind and quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six of his classmates, and he goes to the gym every now and then and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had trouble with it - I remember him sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw away all his guns and other weapons to play with.
I can't believe I was so sure for hours that he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I came to my senses after the explosion and stood up, I looked around and saw hell, pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't stand a chance of surviving this hell.
I remember screaming "Damire, run, run!" but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran.
So our lives go on unlike other people's.
Grigory Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear seared into his bloodied face.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I got dressed two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days", she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember this tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it's been so long, it feels like yesterday, some moments keep coming back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Memories still coming back: Grigory's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a crying Grigori in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at this picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that this picture is a way for people all over the world to know what pain we're feeling.
Today Grigory says, "The important thing is that this never happens again.
I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragedies like this are always being investigated, but the truth is never known.
They're investigating the crash in the Ukraine.
Do we ever know what caused it?
Something very bad is coming to this world.
I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
It takes decades to forget a little.
It affected my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares about the attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I go to the gym every time September 1st comes around.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is in the past.
I won't forget, but I won't regret.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and started studying medicine at Vladikavkaz University.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army at first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
I have been in the military for a long time.
A boy who survived being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a terrorist assassin during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym, sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the assassinating terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like yesterday", said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but couldn't because of injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind me.
Now that I'm older, I'm told that children are better at dealing with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
In 2006, I went to a shrink and I got a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the year after, I went back to the gym for the first and last time.
I fainted.
I'm never going back there again, and don't ask me to show you where I sit in that famous painting.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with a photo of himself taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask about school.
Physically, I'm fine. I'm not in any trouble.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally now.
But still, due to my health, I couldn't join and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including my medical records, and they said it was impossible.
My other hobby is animals, so I joined the vet school.
I finished my second year there.
He's learning how to treat all kinds of animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about this.
It's not something kids should know about, let alone experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain will be there forever.
He's inside, and he's getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'll attend the memorial service.
I know Grigory won't come.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory is a grown man now, but he carries the horror with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say about 50% of the time, you've gotten over the horror, but you can't get over it completely and forget.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed in the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and it's the greatest gift God has ever given me, but I'm hurt by the loss of the dead.
I know families that have had more children, but also widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even when you don't want it to.
I'll never forget my heart almost leaping out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is coming to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
We were once one friendly country, so how did we get to fight each other now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could just round up all the rebels and dump them as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10 years old
The child that was taken to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is being taken to safety by a Russian special task force (left).
Now ten years old (right), she has no memory of the tragedy
In 2004, the world was stunned when a Russian policeman carried little Alyona out of Belgrade.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in captivity in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and together with his new wife Svetlana they have a little girl, whom they named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown up to be a bright, happy girl.
A close friend said that they are a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.
Ruslan is a great father and he wants to keep the kids away from the memories that the tenth anniversary brings.
You can see why.
A man accused of running over a girl at a signpost in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for the hit-and-run of a three-year-old girl at a traffic sign in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at the Pittenween crossing in the East Neuk.
Plaintiffs allege that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient consideration and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, has denied the charges in Dundee Crown Court.
Judge Charles Macnair has set a January date for the hearing.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you're interested in taking pictures or filming underwater, you have a wide selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact camera, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or a GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs about $300.
These are photos I took at a family party with a couple of cameras, all under $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow to get the best results.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly sealed.
Next, adjust the camera according to the type of photos or videos you are going to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scene or filming mode that optimizes exposure for dark underwater environments.
And before you do, figure out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed to go up to 5 feet, others to go up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - many of them won't work.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, but outdoor cameras don't.
Even with an LCD, you'll have poor underwater vision and the composition of the footage will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure dispersion, use that.
Stay close to the surface.
The deeper you dive, the less light you get.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you see.
Get close to the subject being photographed.
That's great advice if you're shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you have to get closer to the subjects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of character was able to make a difference even in an organisation as large as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that had crippled him.
Lawson realized that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the vast majority of patients they treat are interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself", he wrote in May of that year.
I felt like I was out of energy.
He was dealing with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and his wife Juliet was embracing guilt.
He noted: "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later".
When Juliet went away on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague took a chest X-ray.
One time, two weeks before, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the chest or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
Nearly all cases are caused by exposure to asbestos, a fibrous building material once described as "miraculous" but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma was not difficult to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when an industrial ban on asbestos came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation workers, builders, carpenters, and workers in shipyards.
Toxin used in industry in another era hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But such self-righteousness is not appropriate.
It turns out that the mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The death rate from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
The 2,500 deaths from this disease per year are twice as many as the number of people killed in car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we are only now experiencing its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all forms of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The plague of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the stores we shop in.
So mesothelioma has no regard for social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
The privileged bastions from London's department stores to public schools are no hiding place.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we are supposed to be treated are the storage sites of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even put in the insulation.
He was trying to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is possible that there was a lot of asbestos in the basement hallways of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice", he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and janitors - used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was only partially able to answer.
"Of the four doctors who have practised at Guy's Hospital and then developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive".
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17th of this year.
It's not unusual to survive with this diagnosis for so long.
Fifty-five percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now all we can do is repeat Lawson's question: How many of us will get the same disease?
According to Britain's leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Peth, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic hits, some 90,000 people will die in Britain.
Most of them today have no idea that they're going to die this way.
An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory glance at court records, often used by disabled people to seek redress, shows just how widespread the plague of mesothelioma has become.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising the clothing section in two stores - one of which was the company's flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she has two children in their 20's.
"Before it happened", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he could touch me in any way.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
It was named for its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most common building material today is chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals, and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a major health risk that can cause death.
But brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydol) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that there is strong but circumstantial evidence that it was a major cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a flagship store on Oxford Street in London.
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pete's work shows that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients suggests that a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.
A significant part of this exposure is due to the routine use and ventilation of buildings.
No one seems to know for sure that she's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the center of government may not be aware that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that said the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as a strong air current.
Ministers are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Parliamentary Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a thorough medical certificate, it now expects it will take a million pounds and several years of work to thoroughly examine Parliament, upgrade electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 election, MPs will sit in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with several regulations.
There's no telling if this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now all we can do is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was found", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009 when he was struck down by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was in the evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
I was shaking.
It came at a time.
I was so upset.
I thought I wasn't gonna get home in the car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that pain came from the chest wall, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused, the doctors took a chest X-ray and inserted a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs and sent it for analysis.
Still, they didn't diagnose it.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came in with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott didn't link anything to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had been exposed to asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started to feel unwell, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the space between his chest lining and his lung lining.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much, she says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in between Christmas and New Year's, and they told me it was mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of the Macmillan Charitable Organization, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbestos has been found to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in their pipes", he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to show signs of illness.
So mesothelioma is now starting to affect younger people who don't have high-risk occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basement, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, personnel who passed through basement hallways between buildings (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
As it turns out, for decades after the war, hospitals were places where patients could be saved and where the lives of the doctors who treated them could be endangered.
Asbestos is still being removed.
Bunsen 's students built their khan on asbestos mats .
And it's not just the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its excellent insulation and nonflammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students were building Bunsen's khan on an asbestos mat.
Web sites have been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless items like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a large number of homes", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman with mesothelioma could remember was during a garden shed demolition in the 1970s.
So be careful about tearing down the garden shed.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to get it", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't be around for another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was going from a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this", he says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna make another Christmas.
That's right.
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism that keeps us alive -- the very breathing -- is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest wall, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the shape of needles", explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos, probably during his hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and "the lonely breath pushes them to the edge where the lining is".
It's intrusive by nature from the start.
For mesothelioma, the usual treatments used for other cancers are not as effective.
There is a heated debate, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it's worth a shot.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the ribcage", he says.
You can't get a scalpel around it.
The cancer is not responding well to chemotherapy, which has some effect but no cure.
"Sometimes someone survives lung cancer", says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After being diagnosed with mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for people with the same condition.
When they called, he introduced himself cheerfully: "Hello, you've reached the cancer center".
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, each lasting four months, and likely only adding a month to his life.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was gonna give up.
But Lawson was able to put things in a more optimistic light.
After seeing several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait to be sent to him, but I just called and they looked me over", admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a request and have to be approved for payment.
For mesothelioma patients, the key to getting the best treatment available is money.
But when treatments inevitably fail, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they go to court and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But in the 1960s, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it can pose a health risk.
And here we have corporate negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but Morgan said it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that the mesothelioma was caused by asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that the asbestos in the basement was removed in the 1990s.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Limiting exposure to a single company or workplace - usually decades after exposure - has proved to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone out of business.
The insurance records are gone.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response, important new legislation was passed this year to make it easier for mesothelioma patients to claim compensation even if their former employer cannot be found.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, paid for by insurance companies, for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they were exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In this case, the injured party receives 80% of the amount that the court would normally award as compensation - approximately £120,000.
Each year, 300 applications are expected to be successfully processed.
Andrew Morgan, like his mesothelioma patients, thinks £350 million is a good deal.
"It's an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies", he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time had not intervened and people with mesothelioma were able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Secretary of Labor and Social Services, admitted that the law had loopholes.
But Penning and Morgan admit that with seven deaths each year, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and they need help right now", Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiation and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that Lang-Lazdunski boasts a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That's not the most important thing, of course", says Abbott.
You see it all the time with patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
He completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy in late August.
The checks showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had several spots [of cancer] spread throughout my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott went through six more cycles of chemotherapy.
At this time, there are no signs of a tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally draining process.
You have to think about practical things, like getting a financial security deposit when I die or showing a woman how to work an alarm clock on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look ahead.
For Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never get old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
These are the kind of conversations all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not eased by hope or a hint of survival.
Illness brings with it (and ultimately brought with it Stephen Jay Gould) a gloomy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose its own leaders - protesters vow revenge
Despite mounting debate over democratic reform, the Chinese parliament decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
The move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and preparing within hours of the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were furious", said Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong were lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership election would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that by 2017, the people will be able to vote for the executive.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, as it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but it also makes clear that Chinese leaders have firm control over the nomination process of the committee, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who love their country and Hong Kong will be admitted.
The decision comes after the summer months saw some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in years.
The majority of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are being led by the Occupy Central Movement with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the rally, organizers announced that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
But they didn't give any further details, obviously to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In a statement posted on their website, the organizers said the movement was considering occupying the Centre only as a last resort if all options for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other option.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Headquarters is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they stepped up security at the government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Many Hong Kong residents see the incitement of unrest as a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values like democracy and free speech are being distorted by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement and say their demonstrations are endangering Hong Kong's lifeboat trade.
"The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long", says politician Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could harm the investment.
Chinese state media have also in recent days come out with reports portraying democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents directed by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The campaign rally?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
Around 1,600 amateur athletes play the small kick in the regional town of Vysokočina.
And their top competition is now called the Joint for the Head League.
It's named after a movement that's coming up for election in October.
And the head of the small mine in Jihlava, Jan Mráka, is a top 10 candidate.
"There was a general assembly where there was no problem", said Cloud.
The situation around the first Little League has already been addressed by the lawyers of the South Cape Town Council and recommended a change in the system of distribution of subsidies.
The little dig earned about a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, it's still in the hundreds of thousands.
In my legal opinion, the practice of small kicking is not against the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for granting grants and subsidies,' said Radek Tulis, spokesman for the Magistrates' Court.
Pulling subsidy from the city and at the same time expressing a small-time support for one political party in the election, that's probably not gonna work.
The "big" football in the Highlands has not yet received a similar request from politicians.
That there would be a ČSSD regional board, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and all that?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like to have corporate sponsors come to us", said the chairman of the regional football association, Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the other party's little football and the movement in the name of the league won't let
According to the players, the small-scale sport in Jihlava deserves its own complex with six courts, changing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách pitch is not ours, we rent it", said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The best location would be Czech Mill.
But there will be a pointless skating rink for example, which I think will be about 50 in Jihlava", Mráka said.
The mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) reacted that the small kibbutz uses a playground with artificial grass in Rošický and Na Stoupách streets, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a playground that's as utilized as possible.
We're planning to upgrade or build gyms at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a lot of progress has been made in recent years for the little kick", he added.
According to Jan Mráka, no other political parties will appear in the league names.
We have a limit.
If someone from one industry joins us, we don't put another one in", he explained.
"Political movements in the name of the league, I consider it an unfortunate step at least", said Karel Voldán, a member of the city's sports committee.
"But let the voters decide whether Mr. Cloud uses the Little Rock Rock Association and city subsidies for political purposes or not", he added.
American tradition is coming to university life - freshmen can fly jet planes
We're delighted to be able to respond to demand by launching the first luxury student travel service in the UK.
In order to make the best possible impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has a security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to our VIF (very important freshman) options this year to ensure that students arrive at the university with the least amount of nervousness and the most luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the service has only just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.
The company also stated that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students have different expectations and desires - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF programme is just the way to do that.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Higher Education Union, noted: For most students, such a project is out of reach.
Many students entering university this month are facing a financial crisis before they can spend thousands of pounds on something as simple as getting into college, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities.
Feminists are standing up against racism and police brutality in the wake of Ferguson.
Earlier this month, a police officer killed an unarmed youth in Ferguson, Missouri.
The people waiting for the funeral with their hands up, chanting: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noted a shift in online discussions among white feminists.
She found that when it comes to advancing reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With tensions rising in the Midwest, which has attracted national media attention, Perez has noticed that white people's reactions are 100 percent race-centered.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the August 9 shootings, personal articles with headlines like "White Woman Thinking About Ferguson" or "Feminism Is Not Just About Oppressing Women" appeared relatively late.
But Perez says it's a big change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at this level", she said.
People felt they had to speak out about what happened.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're facing because it's so racially charged that they had to bring it up.
According to Ohio State University English professor Korith Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that African-American women face every day and that are not perceived as women's issues in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world", Mitchell said.
When I write about people of color being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it possible for a woman to talk publicly about relationships but not about safety in public?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with issues of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
She felt that black women could not afford the luxury of sharing these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
While white women today are blending race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and almost all of them were for raping a white woman, Hattery said.
You needed white people to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the divide between whites and blacks came when suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
"They decided to bet the cards on women's suffrage and focus on black rights later", explained Hattery.
If we realize that, we can get an important insight into why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to organize against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the first black woman asked for help.
Mitchell said the outrage by white feminists over the issues raised by Ferguson's events -- the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination -- reflected a time when white feminists had to catch up on issues that had plagued black women for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists in these spaces [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell said.
A second wave of feminists who have made a career fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot, posting a column by Rebecca Carroll of The Guardian calling for white Americans to protest more vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions about race that vary widely in opinion polls - will seek change", wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on race in America confuse some people.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's comments to Ferguson face criticism that she has already raised.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic women, it sparked an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship to the black community isn't the only issue that's coming to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border patrol agents detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the southwest this year, the issue of immigration reform has resurfaced - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that to make the issue a necessity for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", says Mercad.
Since most work permits are issued to men, women who come with them are in a vulnerable position to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have resonated with women's organisations", she said.
Pig house in Ipswich for sale
The real estate company removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was posted, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
A one-bedroom detached house for sale for £120,000, on a private road in Ipswich.
The informational photographs included a picture of a living room with a pig resting on a sofa.
Connells Real Estate said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was accidentally placed there, and therefore has been removed", said the office spokesman.
In the property information, the real estate office described Connells' former place of worship as a "single, detached, one-room house".
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the town of Harvey in the southwest has a new millionaire.
Lottery player in Harvey wins a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, one lucky winner taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
Traffic in Harvey was lucky to split the purse for the second time in five years, the last being a million-dollar prize in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the whole town in southwest Perth was talking about winning.
It's the main topic and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was for touch.
Eight winners split one prize in Western Australia last month, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player at Canning Vale became one of the five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple at Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple bet 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
The engineers want higher wages
GDL in a press release called the protest a warning strike, deliberately chosen for a time outside the rush hour.
The GDL takes into account the many people who return by rail from the weekend only during the first working day.
We are also thinking of people commuting to work during the day", the union said in a press release announcing the strike on Monday morning.
'Our first strike should be mainly on freight, less passengers,' GDL added.
DB has not yet issued an official response to the strike.
It is also unclear how the protest will affect international rail links, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent pay rise for engineers and a two-hour workweek.
Currently, the average salary of a driver varies between EUR 36,000 and EUR 46,000 (US$1,3 million and US$1,7 million) per year, depending on the number of years worked.
The engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept a wage increase in the face of reduced working hours.
They stress that the wage assessment of train drivers must be carried out in the same way as for other railway staff for whom DB does not count on a shorter working week.
Krest's car was about to catch fire.
That's why he ended up at the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't think anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service station where the mechanic would replace it?
If we were headed straight for it, yes.
But we had two more erzetas to go, and we couldn't.
It's hot inside, and the risk of the car catching fire was high.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five speed tests at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over the screw.
It was all because we'd been tinkering with the car for over six months to get it up to some level.
The race showed we did it.
You got him so excited that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had a chance to win.
The work was not in vain.
On the other hand, the outcome we could have imagined did not come.
But that's a Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only one from the top who retired early from the championship fight.
The foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi have also dropped out.
Were you surprised to see so many favorites drop out?
- I know.
It was a shame for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you're building a carriage, has been at the top for a long time.
But he paid the price by going off the track and missing by almost two minutes.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the winner's rank.
He was a first-time offender.
But even Mira confirmed that we had the car set up properly.
He was going too fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced your retirement, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can the thrill of driving make you a regular rally driver again?
Not at this point.
Last year I said the Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to ride it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance next year, I'm probably gonna go for it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
We started partly because of them.
A lot of people, known and unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumc?
The team moves on.
Next week we're going to Vyshkov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't damage the car too much here.
Besides, he wants to borrow Fabio Honzo Sykor from us for this race.
Me and Mira are going to the European doubles in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to pack for next year.
Can you make any suggestions?
No, nothing has been decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you reached your maximum in the series with fifth place.
You're not tempted to try the tracks again?
It's not tempting.
Oral agreement with employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a medical certificate of incapacity to work issued to you, which serves as proof to the organisation that you are unable to perform your duties for health reasons.
And you didn't immediately notify your employer of your absence.
Although it was subsequently agreed that the days would be recorded as holidays, the agreement was only made orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require that the employer's consent to take leave be confirmed in writing, this practice has proved successful.
If the agreement is only oral, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave may be refused, as in your case, and the absence from work may be considered as a long-term unjustified absence, thus giving rise to immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
You are thus without evidence in a dispute over an employment contract.
However, your employment relationship has not been terminated under Section 53, only you have certain days listed on the bill of lading as unjustified absence.
An unjustified absence from the balance sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. inability to receive unemployment benefit), but it makes it more difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you see your doctor again and have a written confirmation that the accident that made you unfit for work actually occurred (this is not a 'non-accident', it is just a doctor's certificate).
When you are looking for a new job, you can present this document and explain your situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate the importance of both a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and early notification to the employer or the requirement of written consent to take leave.
You avoid any possible complications.
Tony Stewart 's accident on his way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little over halfway down the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the grid for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172 and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car into the garage, didn't speak to reporters, and left.
Team principal Chad Johnston said the No. 14 team was disappointed, but would now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better ending", Johnston said.
We're gonna go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart hit the grid for the first time in Sunday night's race after colliding with Kyle Busch, which required repair of the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good finish to today's race", Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to go.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend, and to do that, he needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to catch up.
He returned to racing during the investigation of a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had run into Stewart's car during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident will take at least another two weeks.
It's not yet decided whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion received a warm cheer before the race.
Stewart started 12th, worked his way up to 10th at the start of the race, and then even to fourth.
Then, at the start of lap 122, Busch's car number
18 went out of control, went out of turn two and hit Stewart, sending both cars into the grid.
Stewart continued, but dropped to 21st.
Prague has chosen a new taxi driver, he'll earn 12.3 million
The Commission has decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108 (3) of the Treaty in respect of the selection of the new taxi operator.
For 103 parking spaces, he earns about 12.3 million crowns a year.
Until recently, the taxis charged 150,000 crowns a year for the same seats for taxi drivers.
This was reported by the councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city used to draw lots to select its administrators.
The winner then received a flat-rate rent of 1,000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
At the moment, it's the bidding.
'A year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the opening of the tendering procedure, it has been shown that the new leasing system is far more advantageous and fairer overall for Prague,' the councillor claims.
The most expensive place is in Pershing
The highest bid was for a position on Perštýna Street.
He's paying 2.1 million a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rental rules for taxi stands were adopted by the council in autumn 2012 and the original rental contracts were terminated last summer.
The selection procedure was conducted in four rounds and 29 posts were found for the new administrator.
This is the second time this year we've had to clean a well.
We let it all out every time, creating practically a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured the Savo.
The smell is unbelievable!
Our well in the basement always produced a lot of beautiful fragrant water.
And it wasn't some professional piece of work, my grandfather dug it out himself.
It was a long time ago.
She was just a three-bit, all-around weirdie, like everything else in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we thought the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if something had fallen.
The place where the pump went through, which was unfortunately possible, the board didn't quite fit, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, so we lit it up to the bottom.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised sealing around the pump tube.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a package on the floor with some sticky pieces on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And another one.
Now it looked like a glowing mouse.
At the ceiling, in the air vents, Grandpa's invention, there were fish scraps!
And the hard drive!
Our basement is weird, too.
Some would say Grandpa just ransacked the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just sand, only the ceiling is broken.
It's mostly boats.
And the bicycles.
And a beach couch.
The door with the wide gaps was usually open, as if someone was walking through it all the time.
There are several air vents in the ceiling.
No nets, so birds commonly fly in and nest on the railings.
It's no use talking about the mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be airy, and it was.
This time, the air didn't help.
The whole basement stank.
So we cleaned out the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the grass was nutritious!
We also threw out the stuff that was around: the planks, the Heraklite tablet, and so on.
Our remote cabin greeted passersby with a disinfectant scratch.
We wondered who would have brought us the disgusting leftovers.
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
I don't think she'd be coming to our place for lunch.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
What if he's the one who snuck the filth in through the windpipe?
He's here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We decided to keep watch and check the basement and the well regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, just for washing and laundry until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pumping water from a forest fountain is not something I've wanted to do for a long time.
One day we heard our fairy's terrible anxious bark.
My mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass by the porch.
Reza jumped over her and whistled like crazy.
My mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug out the sink.
But then, suddenly, the hose partly twisted into a knob and partly straightened.
There was a hissing on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical fit.
We ran down.
The snake, over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza prevented it.
It was unclear if she wanted to save the toad or eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snail saw the superiority of our entire family, I guess it thought, "Let's eat it while we're hungry", and elegantly ran through the vent to the basement.
We flew to see her.
She jumped over the well like a lightning bolt.
We've also picked up another stinking package on her record.
I think it's a fish, by the smell.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a drag.
And we locked the basement during the day.
I mean, I...
We went outside and we each leaned against one vent.
We didn't wait long.
It's stuck in the well.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on its neck.
Then a whole snail came out into the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and started to conquer the inside.
The fired employee got even, bought the company's laptops and sold them
A disgruntled employee bought computers for the company after being fired and then sold them.
He spent the money before the police arrested him.
In a short time, the man bought a total of 16 computers for more than $200,000 in 12 cases.
"After the seizure, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars", said Rostislav Brückner, the chief police commissioner of the Szumper Police.
The motive for the fraud was revenge for the employer's dismissal and also for financial gain.
"When questioned, he claimed that he had used the money to pay off loans", Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster was a pathological gambler who had repeatedly undergone psychiatric treatment.
Money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we found no money on him", said the commissioner.
A former convicted fraudster now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said if the bazaars that bought the laptops at a lower price and continued to sell them are also facing punishment.
'It is true that they were taking on brand new goods, which is the least suspicious thing,' the Commissioner said.
However, no one from the bazaar has been charged.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do it or I'll have fun We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared a few changes for us.
The biggest was the change of course that brought the target to the floodplain instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to greet our readers in person at the booth, where we took pictures and videos together.
To perfect my view of the other side, I took on the role of personal guide.
Just before takeoff, my friend Katya and I obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who were passing us in the fast-runner sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of minions to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and go!
Cheers, but instead of a quick start, there was a buzzing toward the starting line.
Five minutes later, we reach the gate, I turn on the meter, and we hit the 10-hour mark.
We are intertwined with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly descending sun in the sky adds a near-kinky look to the view of Vysehrad.
The pulsating mass dragging along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
The waterfront between Vysehrad and the National Theatre is where the tradition of who has more power begins to show.
The gentle hillside on Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the crossing into the Theater, I see a police escort and immediately behind him, Vítek Pavlišta is flying at an incredible speed to the finish.
I hear the admiring, faint sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I cheer him up, he's about to clap with me, but right before that, my leg snaps and our hands are about to slip.
Running down Theatre Street gives you a chance to rest and breathe.
It's necessary, there are places ahead where the views take my breath away.
A turn on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all its beauty as the sun sets.
I can't breathe and my legs are carrying me almost alone.
After the first snack, there's a moment of truth.
Katya crosses the road, strikes the curb and makes a jump.
I see if she needs help, and I run a series of words of encouragement so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It goes up and we continue down Goat Lane, one of the narrowest places on the track, and at this stage of the race, there's not that much traffic, but you still need to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I don't know that the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, we are frantically cheered on by tourists and fellow runners.
I try to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I recommend it to Katya, because ten clap with the fans is like half an energy bar.
It's working, we're accelerating again, and although we've fallen quite significantly, the chase is now underway.
We're outrunning dozens of runners, and when I pass someone who's particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
We're not outdone at the last snack, we're picking up speed.
We've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding up, nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you really need to work hard.
The sun has already set, and the end of the day symbolically ends the race.
Last exit to the bridge, turn and just one more straight to the finish.
The way we're running, I wonder where this girl is coming from.
"Come on, we're going under the thirteenth hour, we're working!" I call.
We try, we sprint, and there's the finish.
Thirteen minutes and six seconds.
Well, what can you do?
Coach set the time limit at 20.
So seven minutes under schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the finish line, Katya's legs are breaking, and I'm helping her to the railing, where she's resting for a while.
She's exhausted, but also lucky to have done well.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of the crowds in the hallways to the dressing rooms.
You can see from here that Goat Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
This brings us to the finish line of a race that is packed to the brim with almost 10,000 runners.
If you don't like crowds, this is no place for you.
I lose my head for a moment, too, wondering if the beautiful views and the more interesting route than in previous flights were worth what's happening at the finish.
I know from experience that running a race is no fun.
If you add to that the 10,000 people, the rich accompanying programme and the closure of the whole of the centre of Prague to all traffic, it's a huge challenge.
This year's change of course has brought many interesting places to the runners, but it has also brought some really nasty surprises.
The excellent atmosphere of the Yellow Baths was transmitted to the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators stepped it up every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, running through the historic city centre has its obstacles, which cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say the race ended with a finish, I'd say it was a very successful one.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but in the end, it worked out.
Let us know if you enjoyed the route and what you think of the situation at the finish.
Prison guards organize protests in Bulgaria
Hundreds of prison officials from across Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
The peaceful demonstration reiterated their demand for the restoration of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov includes higher salaries.
For a month, the guards symbolically protested the new hours and demanded a return to the original 24-hour shifts.
Although prison guards' unions and the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, reports Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The negotiations are still ongoing", said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the BNR's General Directorate of Prison Service.
Members of the Federation of Employees' Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the prison service workers' protests.
Why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we can't see them?
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University hit it off in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for the layman to delve into the myriad of problems facing many theoretical physicists today - the attempt to unite two brilliantly functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of Elegant Universe is that, when it comes to finding a unified theory of physics, it's not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between two key theories, because at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws, and they're solving it so ingeniously that it's worth retelling to the layman.
Moreover, Greene's handling of complex material was so fresh and engaging that he cannot be faulted for not including much interesting material in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, the author would not mind his book getting outdated any faster, but the fact is that after 15 years, Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layperson with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years this field will be a little more alive (perhaps because the LHC will finally go "full throttle"), so now is a good time to enter Green's peacefully opened door to the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe might have more than three spatial dimensions certainly sounds silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is specific and entirely acceptable.
To understand this, let us take a moment to look away from the universe as a whole and toward something more mundane, namely, a long, thin garden hose.
Imagine that you are pulling a 100-foot garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other, watching the entire scene from a half-mile [0.5 km] away (as in the picture and on the next page).
From this distance, you can easily see a long, horizontal tube, but unless you have nearsightedness, you can hardly tell the thickness of the tube.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose would have only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you can answer with just one statement: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a half-mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we zoom in, we suddenly see another dimension, in the shape of a circle surrounding a hose.
In this enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can in fact move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the 'clockwise/clockwise dimension', around the circular section of the hose.
You're starting to understand that to determine the location of a little ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle surrounding the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note that experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on fault theory of strings.
The integrity aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the peripheral dimension, represented by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The length of the hose is long and easily visible.
The diameter of the hose circuit is short, "scrumpled" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to study the tube at a much better resolution.
The above example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can be large, extensive, and therefore directly visible, or small, curved, and much less visible.
Of course, in this case, we didn't exactly pre-empt the dirty dimension of the hose thickness.
All you had to do was bring a telescope to help.
But if the tube was thinner -- like a hair or a capillary -- we would have to work really hard to uncover the porous dimension.
Kaluza sent Einstein his paper in 1919 in which he advanced the startling idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions that we all know.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by arguing that the extra dimension provides an elegant and compelling framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be summed up in a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how Kaluz's observation fits in with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines and which was clearly articulated and refined by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that just like dimensions in the direction of the length of a hose, our universe has large, vast, easily visible three dimensions that we are aware of at any given moment.
But analogous to the circular circuit of a garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, tightly wrapped up in space so tiny that they have hitherto remained hidden from even our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let us stay a moment longer with the hose.
So let's say we draw a black line of relatively dense circles on the perimeter of a hose.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
Now with the telescope, we can see the dirty dimension even more easily with the drawing, because we see the motif in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension being large and almost infinite and the other dimension being short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, so together four spatial dimensions.
It's hard to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help your imagination a little, look at the illustration in Figure 3. It shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In this image, we're magnifying the geometry of space in a way that's similar to how we magnified the surface of a hose.
Each successive level represents a huge magnification of the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are encased in a small enough space; this explains why we have not yet observed them directly.
The square grid represents the familiar "big" dimensions, while the circle represents the new, tiny, convex dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in any place of normal size - we have only drawn them in the intersections of a square grid for the sake of clarity.
The background in Figure 4 shows the familiar structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such ordinary scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a grid.
In each of the following images, we're going to focus on a small area of the previous image; we're going to zoom in to make it visible.
Nothing special happens at first, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
But as we move on our journey to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space, to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3, we suddenly see a new, circular, twisted dimension, like loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an extra circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of the large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circuit at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we've only plotted the circle dimension at some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity to the snake is obvious, although we note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we've drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
And the even more important difference is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object in the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the extra circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize - like the circular circuit of a hose - than to observe the apparent, large and expansive dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most advanced magnification tools.
Most importantly, the extra dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of the three usual expansive dimensions.
It is a dimension in the other three dimensions independent of each other, just as the top-down, left-right, and front-back dimensions are independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A tiny enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data points, in addition to the usual three, and a circular position; if we count time, five data points, at least one more than we would normally expect.
You were curious?
You can buy Brian Green's Elegant Universe at books.idnes.cz.
The price of the e-book is CZK 149.
So to our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not rule out the existence of additional curved dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with our naked eyes.
How small should they be?
The most advanced technical equipment can recognize structures as large as a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
The smaller, more convoluted dimensions are hardly visible.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with some ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the extra circular dimension could be about one Planck length, a size far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola gives advice on how to practice on electric guitar: Part 5
The whole point of a "twelve" is a 12-stroke harmonic form that you can repeat as you please.
Anyone who delves into music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homol or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
Educated as a puppeteer and puppeteer guide, whose Facebook profile you can follow here, he's been making a living as a graphic designer since graduating from high school 20 years ago.
He's the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which he's unfortunately unable to leave.
He's a guitarist by his father's side, as is his brother Matěj, leader of the Wohnuts.
Start practicing on one string.
"The rhythmic pattern is up to you, you can make up anything you want, then apply it to the harmonic pattern of twelve", advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the piece again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what you can do with a twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it starts to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can flirt with the melody of some song.
When you finally add the fourth, watch for the change of tuning, Honza warns in the video.
Next time Honza goes back to pentatonic, you try to put it together with exactly 12.
Then practice it honestly.
Best of all, you can read about it in an interview with Jan Homola at his first electric guitar school here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, the castle courtier acknowledges.
We're taking a point and we're happy for it.
We, the second home side, had more chances in the first half", said the striker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
You weren't nervous playing it, after all, it had a huge whistle?
I didn't notice it particularly, although on the second goal, where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You tied the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter, man?
We fell asleep at the start, we were passive, it was a corner and then a penalty.
You got up after that and in the first half, you were the better team, you had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree we played well after the goal until halftime.
In the cockpit, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's also true that the home team had some comments about the halftime game, maybe they weren't too happy with it.
You've scored your first goal on the field, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
What's the difference?
I wouldn't say it's that different, it's more about how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Pilsen, that's a different category.
Four games you waited for a goal, weren't you worried that after the last game it might be similar?
I hope not, but of course we're glad we don't have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal since the last game.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still three in six games, which isn't much of a celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater a mile away.
Lava floating to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a crater a kilometer away.
It's under the glacier, as is part of the underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now the most worrying to scientists...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.)
The volcano is still erupting about the same amount of lava.
However, contrary to the original estimates, the volume is lower, not 1000 m3, but 'only' 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption on 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
But scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open up in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, and with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean massive flooding of both the Jökulsá á Fjöllum and other rivers.
A strong smell of sulfur is heard around the eruption, clouds of vapour and gas rising from the fissure.
The volcano is certainly not suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger and there are also much more gases", says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the area in the early hours of the morning.
The sandstorm tracks were washed away by the rain.
The scientists can continue their work.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties.
The sky above Cheb was the brave Lady Peggy's.
She walked on wings
Flying day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, flight acrobat Peggy Walentin performed a flight climb from the cockpit to the overhead and interplane beams.
There, it relies solely on muscle strength.
This year's Cheb Aviation Day was the fifth, and the organizers once again managed to produce some interesting pieces of aviation.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "Wingswalking" performed by German acrobat Peggy Walentina, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention with his shiny coat.
The acrobatic art of wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to make a name for themselves.
But due to the high number of fatalities, it was banned.
But today, he's slowly returning to the airline days program.
Peggy will exit the cockpit and climb to the upper wing after takeoff.
He's doing a lot of exercises there.
Towards the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues", said Luděk Matěček from the Chebsk Ultralight Club and the organiser of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was the icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter flew with the Grippens of the Czech Republic Army in a curtain (so-called on numbers).
This was the first time that aviation fans in the Czech Republic had seen such a setup.
Pilot Miroslav Sazavski then demonstrated a breathtaking aerobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
It was made during the war, but he probably never took part.
He was in the Army Reserves.
He has been active in the civilian sphere since 1963.
Even as a racing plane.
Today, it has its home hangar at the airport in Munich Castle.
In the same spot is another jewel of Cheb flight day, a twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no way to miss the massive machine at the airport.
His polished aluminum coating glowed in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard, in the colours of the French Air Force, has also been admired.
A small transport plane jumped over the abandoned Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from the German city of Hof for the flight day.
The German neighbors in Cheb demonstrated with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
Lucie Borhy has replaced parental concerns with work concerns, at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness, the blonde news anchor obviously knows none of that.
She was doing so well at hosting TV news that it was as if she hadn't stopped talking to him in two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde finished sixth trimester, when postpartum women experience the most stress.
But Lucie will not be a regular on TV Nova's main news program yet.
According to Blesk.cz, she won't be back for a month.
It's just that her daughter Linda needs her more than the television audience.
Lucie Borhy was back on the TV screen, and it was a shot in the dark.
The exhibition in Prague next year?
The hall would be sold out, he's planning a farewell party Jagr
It would be dignified if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union reacts", he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called Golden Match, in which the amazing Nagano team was reunited.
Even the players who scored the golden hat trick.
The players would be hungry, wouldn't they?
I'm sure you will.
It would be nice to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think you can find a day or two during the tournament when it's totally free and where you can mix up a game like this.
We'll tell Gum or Bed Shcherban, who will take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play New Jersey in the playoffs?
So if I come up like this...
You don't want to play for the national team.
Or did the Southern meeting somehow change your mind?
A national team match and an exhibition match are two different things, and in a national team match, performance is the deciding factor.
It's one thing for people to want to see me there, but performance is key, especially at the World Championships.
It's a place where players should go who can afford it, not because they have a good reputation.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagan reunion, anyway?
Just meeting the players was great.
You brought the stories to life and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience, not only for the fans, but for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was to honor Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that a generation is leaving that really made it worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Růžička and Petr Čechmánek are on the switch.
Do you remember your first national team game?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young guys, me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we came in as a three-way tie.
It was the first start for the team.
Well, we're not really dominating in any way.
In Jihlava, after a long time, Dominik Hashek caught.
What did you say about his performance?
A bear on ice never surprises.
I wanted to return the criticism, but I can't (Hashek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
And Rotting Man did a great job.
He was training with me one night, and he was a jerk.
And now he's catching famous people.
First the USA, then the Netherlands, the football players start qualifying
The NH Hotel in Laughingstock was packed with prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, Chelsea goalkeeper Peter Čech, national team coach Pavel Vrba...
And that figure over there in the black helmet, that's Tomasz Rossky!
Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the meeting at around half past twelve.
We have a beautiful game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be?" he said, speaking to reporters in the national team.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday 1 September: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Open practice for the fans (18:30, Summer) Autographed by the fans (20:00)
Wednesday, September 3rd, Czech Republic against the USA
Tuesday, September 9th, Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the meeting
The fans can support Rosicrucian and the team before Wednesday's game against the United States.
The national team has opened their training on Tuesday, which starts at 6:30 p.m. on Summer.
And then there will be an autograph ceremony, which neither the Russian nor the Czech will miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be calmer.
Which is praised by Coach Vrba, who just complained about the amount of social events in the spring.
We're finally gonna do what we want to do.
We're going to focus on the Netherlands now.
It's an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been done so much before", said Vrba, who has officially been in charge of the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The national team has three matches under the Willow, all preliminary.
She drew 2-2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1-2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet significant.
I'm not sure.
The match against the Netherlands will be the start of qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they could also manage the general against the USA.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about it to be successful", agreed Willow.
The only player on the 23-man roster with a medical condition is forward David Lafata.
He's got a fever.
If he doesn't recover by Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Vrba will call another forward.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how for many years after being misdiagnosed, she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another illness, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence believing she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is thought that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
The condition is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms may worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she had Friedreich's ataxia, a disease with a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she was 18, she'd be in a wheelchair and dead by 30.
A mother of two, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
Every day I fell, and it took me longer to do everything.
I was never allowed to skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied at school for the way I walked and ran.
When Rodgers was 13, and she was undergoing several operations to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's leaving the room to look through her records and learn that she had FA.
"I felt guilty for sneaking around, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA", she says.
When they answered, I was in shock, completely panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral.
When she was 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's going to be something a lot less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid", she declared.
The charity CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Washington businessmen: Tax increases as the economy turns
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxes in the country have risen slightly in the past year as the economy has accelerated its recovery, and Washington businesses have been no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia collectively contributed $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Tax burdens - state and local - rose 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent last year, the third consecutive year of growth after tax cuts in 2009 and 2010.
According to a study by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes rose faster, by 4.3%, than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from business taxes, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has the lowest proportion of business tax revenue.
The researchers claim that most of the growth in tax revenues comes from the increase in the value of corporate property, which has increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012, a 4.2 percent year-over-year increase.
However, the apparent increase in property values does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes account for less than one-fifth of corporate tax.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for almost half of state and local taxes.
"Many Maryland properties are owned by corporations, mostly taxpayers in the D.C. area, the government or nonprofit organizations that don't pay taxes", explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering property market.
The data show that business revenues are also increasing.
Companies in the region reported $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected a billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing at the same rate in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was on par with the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland's growth rate was significantly higher at 4.9%.
Only Virginia had a tax increase below the average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three counties (all of which have the same tax rate) at 6%.
Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a more favorable overall tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from southern competition.
North Carolina recently signed a bill lowering the corporate tax rate from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year it will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet its revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
A recent study found that small business owners in Washington are doing better, which is why they pay higher state and local taxes.
The payroll tax paid by small business owners as a personal income tax -- the structure of compensating for cost increases by raising prices that most businesses are organized around -- in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers claim that the trend and the nationwide increase in business tax is likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments increasing to 6,2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may be lagging behind others because cutting government spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk will be the head of Europe, Putin's Novorossiya and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state be established in Ukraine?
Putin called for talks on Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been fighting pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they would find it difficult to return to the Russian market under the current anti-Russian sanctions regime.
He is responsible for the violent repression of the 'Donetsk People's Republic' and 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
He said that the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Another sanction for Russia?
The Czech Republic has exercised its right to object to the part
The European Commission and diplomats are due to propose a form of further tightening of sanctions against Russia within a week, the EU summit decided tonight.
This was stated to reporters by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the meeting of the member states.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the change in the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU "president".
Van Rompuy will be replaced in December.
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit as the head of the European Council, the so-called EU president who chairs the summits of member states.
He's replacing Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
The Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will succeed Catherine Ashton as head of European diplomacy.
The Italian woman who will become the next Vice-President of the European Commission must still be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted dying is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it's not talked about.
Helping an incurable, long-suffering patient with a terminal illness?
In Czech conditions, where the law does not allow euthanasia, it is legally not possible.
Nevertheless, the comments of the doctors who approached LN indicate that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says sclerosis doctor
In the Czech Republic, about 300 people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergoing experimental stem cell treatment at the Prague Motola.
We don't know 100% if she'll succeed.
But if we don't try, we won't find out", says Radim Mazanec, a neurologist in Motol.
It's CIA handwriting, they needed war, Huml writes about the downing of MH17
The Czech Social Democratic Party MP Stanislav Huml has a clear idea of who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
He said it was clear that 'the harsh sanctions imposed in view of the downing of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead were deliberately imposed by the Ukrainian army'.
And according to the legislator, it's also a CIA handwriting test.
Promises that can't be kept.
The election is coming up and the parties are offering the impossible again.
No more homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car over Prague.
It's the same thing every election: parties promise the impossible.
Now, too, with the local elections approaching, politicians are racing to see who the voters like best.
Server Lidovky.cz chose unfulfilled promises from the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechs landed at Dunkirk.
The siege began.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška constantly requested to be reinforced with technical equipment and sent to the front.
The British side eventually complied and included this ground unit as one of their forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in German hands.
Plzeň leads the league ahead of Prague's "S", Liberec has been disqualified by Miník
Viktoria Pilsen is the new leader of the football league, leading by a point ahead of both Prague "S".
The change in the leaderboard was caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, thanks to two strokes of Lafat, they defeated Jablonec.
The record win in the year was attributed to Liberec, who shot Miník Ostrava 6:0.

Joan Rivers family: "Holding our fingers together"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her down.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had suffered cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy on the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious".
Reactions were quick, including incredible online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is a twisted subtitle
The media's headline distortion of reality is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines sell newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called readers who read nothing else.
And that's been a real concern for me lately, and the word "annoying" is more appropriate.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It's quite common to see headlines like "Israel attacks Gaza".
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to rockets fired from Gaza, often during a declared ceasefire.
That's when the headline comes up, "Both sides violated ceasefire".
Does the journalistic community realize that by doing so, it is directly contributing to the rise in anti-Semitic attitudes throughout Europe (and beyond)?
It has not even been 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still people alive who survived the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany of crowds shouting "Jewish pig" and similar superstitions, I was stunned.
Is the world trying to finish what Hitler failed?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, they were destined to exterminate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You're often referred to as "the watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its people.
How would you like our government to survive if one of our neighbors decided to wipe out the Czech nation and wipe the Czech Republic off the map?
Perhaps you should also consider one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go to Gaza, they'll tell you why they would.
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch healthcare (I saw firsthand how the top-notch private Hadassah Hospital, which is funded by donations from Jewish donors from all over the world, is frequented by Arabs and, of course, treated there).
Hamas is using its missiles to attack its Arab brothers.
The only real help for Gaza, and therefore for this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even if indirectly in the headlines.
Report on Hamas's practices, their use of people as human shields.
Let it be known that Hamas is determined to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of innocent Arab children.
Let it be known that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area has been able to flourish thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which the Gaza authorities do not pay and are even upset that the power supply is sometimes cut during this time.
If Hamas hadn't invested in building underground tunnels for suicide bombers to enter Israel, but instead had invested in building homes, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion.
Amazon just confirmed Monday morning's announcement: The online retailer - a producer of videos and hundreds of other items - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for a billion dollars seemed certain, and the connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was on its way to becoming a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream online gameplay - in the words of Business Insider YouTube for live streaming.
The Twitch interface.
YouTube is already popular with Let's play videos, the kind where wise guys (mostly older) give games a Mystery Science Theater treatment.
The fact is that YouTube is getting a lot of buzz when it comes to Twitter, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn't really excite anyone, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at this point is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, share our values and long-term vision, and want to help us achieve it faster.
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they'd rather do sports than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing games instead of actually watching them.
It's one thing to watch a friend's shoulder at 3:00 in the morning play Resident Evil, and it's another thing entirely to watch a stranger get 20 shots to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit, speed run games, where Roger Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone isn't a master of acting or humor, their Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly hits and is the fourth-highest internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming and media and don't seem to be reluctant, even as - swallow - viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time, the theme is "The Holy Scriptures Are God's Word".
Attached is the original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When people in the faith debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often ask us, Who will you believe?
The so-called word of God or the word of man?
As if human inquiry were nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man", they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they are referring to the myths about God that men have written down.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added the other lines of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It looks like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans couldn't have created any of these things.
But people can tell stories, they can make up stories.
And they were the people who wrote all these texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
Men who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods or perhaps by the dictates of angels, but these texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain amount of imagination, not angels and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an over-galactic super-genius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of that size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy scripture.
It would be known throughout the world, without a predecessor, parallel or alternative in any language, because only human authors could match such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it because it would be consistent, backed by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a profound morality and wisdom far beyond any human limitation.
It would continually inspire each reader to unite in the common faith.
If God wrote it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, all constantly breaking up into increasingly separate denominations, searching for contested truths, each claiming somehow to be guided by God, despite continuing disunity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian gospel, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdás, the Zoroastrian Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharati Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia Book are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true God", and the respective believers of each say that the others are in error.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is, to some extent, misguided.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence, and none of them can be verified historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require belief as well as apology (defense) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true that have been overcome.
So they cannot be said to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities rather than morality, and many claim to have been confirmed by fulfillment of prophecy - each of which may also contain prophecies that were not fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more like a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some scholars now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, the five Books of "Moses", and they do not attribute any of them to Moses because he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Scholars agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetites and Ebionites and their very different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by further Bible revisions.
One of these amendments relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a serious threat to the young Mosaic religion, the New Testament writers decided to ridicule Baal Zebub, the "Lord of the Mountain", and change him to Beelzebub, the "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible has been deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four Gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by a simple show of hands, as if the truth of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem church?
And what about the Church of Rome at the same time?
And they gradually found that they were getting closer to the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon developed from the very beginning of the church.
So the council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also deliberately removed more than a dozen books from the Bible, even though they referred to books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God's Word refer to books that are merely the words of men and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the real author of this random mixture of legend, parable, and psalm-poetry?
The Bible was certainly written by men, and certainly not by those who were too enlightened.
That's why so much of what it says is historically and scientifically completely wrong, about almost anything from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to sprinkle blood on someone, it would cure the leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi is a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed the stripes to a pregnant cow, she would give birth to a stripe calf.
How can someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
The authors of this book didn't know that, of course.
If the Bible were written by a higher source, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain none of the things it does.
It fails utterly as a moral guide because most of the original Hebrew scriptures were written by ignorant and bigoted savages who overlooked or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming to be doing God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their Web sites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
Why would you do that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, it's the same thing.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping the creation rather than the Creator".
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and they even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that men have approved or rejected in their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, composed, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately altered and distorted by mere errant men.

Chinese school attacker stabs nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen broke into the elementary school building this morning and attacked around 11:30 local time, according to the New China Agency.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Qchen then committed suicide by jumping from a height, New China said, citing the regional government.
In recent years, China has seen a series of similar attacks on schools and children.
Public outcry has prompted calls for greater security and better child protection in a country where many couples have only one child, in line with the government's one-child policy.
He showed the first-year students in Lanes how he had to sit in school
The youngest students were taken to their classrooms by ninth graders, where they and their teacher waited for the arrival of the president.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that is no longer waiting for you, you are already free people", Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the firstborn a puzzle as a gift.

The Minister of Education, Marcel Chládek, opened the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to link Czech education more closely with Czech sport", he said, explaining one of the reasons why he went to the north of the country on the first day of school.
The school board approached him at a hockey game in Litvínov a while ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the opening of the school year", the minister added.
The Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) opened the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
There are 115,000 first-year students enrolled this year.
The Ministry of Education estimates that a total of more than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405,000 will attend secondary schools.
The new art director of Nova News is David Fiala

David Fiala is very good at synergy communication between the editorial, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the job of news art director.
It has a sense of typography and a clean elegant design, which is the way we want to continue in Nova's news visual", says Nova's creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly hacked, naked photos of celebrities leaked to the public
Screenshot of the leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan is posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, US-based Mashable.com reported.
He allegedly obtained them by gaining unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities dismiss the images as fakes, but several of those involved have already admitted to the authenticity of the images.
Among them are Jennifer Lawrence, who played the title character in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in the horror film, The Death Trap 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the images and videos to enrich himself.
The footage has reportedly been picked up by an American magazine, according to reports on 4chan, but the hacker wants money from the community instead.
According to The Next Web, it's very likely a security flaw in iCloud.
A tool appeared on GitHub two days ago that allowed users to obtain passwords for their accounts through brute force, automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was released.
iCloud users should therefore change their Apple ID password for prevention purposes.
The key is the length of the password, not its complexity.
The length of the text shall be at least 12 characters.
The leak of nude celebrity photos should be seen as a reminder of safe online use.
Although servers from companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times more secure than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is a risk that is unnecessary.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt your files before uploading.
It is also wise to set up automatic photo backup from your phone to run only on Wi-Fi and when connected to a charger.
This will allow you to move sensitive images to a safe place in time, and more importantly, you will have the space to delete the unsuccessful images so that they do not take up unnecessary space in the online storage.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to the readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valašek in PDF format.
A clever way to save on college scripts
Since the cost of a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming sophomore came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of lending books to high school classmates with a nominal compensation offer to delay their resale.
"I got a calculation book that normally costs $180 for the semester for ten and chicken nuggets", says Schroeder, 19, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have various options for managing these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder's are becoming the preferred choice of students.
Book lending is on the rise, allowing students to use a book during the semester, often at a significant discount to buying one.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 bookstores on campus, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the department shows that about a quarter of the books in university libraries were borrowed during the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of textbooks are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books on the Internet can be as much as a third lower than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the Calculus book by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but you can buy a new one online at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's comments or wear and tear, textbooks are a good option.
On Chegg.com, Calculus is selling for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business.
New one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not essential to the work in the seminaries.
If so, the older editions may be sold at a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Loans
You should also consider lending textbooks, provided you treat them well, remember to return them, and do not need to keep them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow Calculus for a semester for about twenty dollars.
Read the terms and conditions of the bookstore where you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting, wear and tear and damage.
Please note: If you do not return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
Other, including paper and paperboard
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a regular book.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the amount of aid granted to the beneficiary.
Chegg is lending Calculus for six months for about $61.
This, Bracey says, will help literature students find the best deals, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and technology texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who's about to start law school at Pepperdine, recommends following the ISBN because it's a guarantee that you're buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it is actually from stock, advises Gault.
He saw it for himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for the book from the university library.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of rifles from the end of the war in the well.
The well is near St. George's Church.
We discovered the weeds around and began to pull up the old litter - about a foot and a half of mud and rotting leaves.
As we approached the muddy bottom, we hit a barrel", said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found out it was the torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The find is said to be unusual.
I understand these rifles were in production until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them", Novak added.
All the wooden construction stuff has decomposed over time, so it's useless.
But her body is preserved - it keeps its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably for fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dumping their weapons in the woods", the finders think.
The rifle was the only thing the Autumn Rainbow Movement enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, which used to be everywhere, so we slowed down the excavation, carefully scouring the mud to prevent any disaster, but there was nothing else down there", Novak said.
The find will end up in the museum's depository in a castle in nearby Silesian Rudolci.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the captured Czech
An exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who is liberating Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
"Sorry, I have to take this... I'm being called from Donetsk", said Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, also the director of the Prisoner-of-War Liberation Center, about eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálne.cz.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers, or where they are - or should be - as Ruban clarified with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there", he ended one of his flash discussions with Donetsk and returned to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, former fighter pilot and active participant in the anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Just yesterday, when we were arranging the interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is being carried out 24 hours a day.
Aktuality.cz: You may know that Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates the number at 30.
But there could be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed Serbs, Dagestanians, Chechens, a Swede, a Georgian... but not a Czech yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captive compatriot and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What advice do you have for Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if they, like the Czechs, fight in the Ukrainian volunteer battalions and are captured by the separatists, they will be shot without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men mercenaries and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them a Czech - they put them behind bars and treat them like prisoners of war.
The guy's just gonna live.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to rescue?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting the people we helped a long time ago.
But we only liberated them... not saved them from war if they chose to continue fighting.
Saviors are doctors, surgeons in war, but we're definitely not.
That's the way it is.
And every day, more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a trade-off.
Sometimes a simple human request is enough to free a prisoner.
A.cz: It is said that in a few months you have gained a lot of authority and even trust among the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides of the war?
That's a tough one.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the mad general with the balls of steel".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that's the essence of what we do.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've gained some of that authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it's very uncomfortable for the Ukrainian government or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I just tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job could be the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long whisper)... Ukrainians and separatists are both used to torture prisoners during interrogations.
I'm afraid not.
And the executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
No indication that the Ukrainian military is doing anything like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't give you the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the character and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
They include officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to get independence and maybe democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with the Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their implacable opponents to the death.
As we say, they've eaten themselves to death.
The same dreams and desires were expressed by the people on the Maidan.
And now I'm speculating a little bit: Russia is supporting the separatists and the West is supporting the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
But there is an irreconcilable contradiction in my sentence.
A.cz: For example, what do you think of one of the hardest-line leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of battle, I am unarmed, showing my bare hands to soldiers or armed men.
And I'm always on both sides of those 200 or 300 meters on a shotgun or in a scope.
I can see the faces of the people pointing at me... and they can pull the trigger at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if it is, it's just like a small province in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time and considers Ukraine a misunderstanding.
He doesn't think such a state should even exist.
He is also an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a talk show on Ukrainian television, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
I always get at least five times scared walking those 300 meters.
So why should I hide the opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harmful to our country?
A.cz: Do you think he had a hand in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk "Rabbit".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of Ukrainians to be feared or respected and authorized by others.
His behavior is a direct copy of the rabbit's.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister he has no right to cry in Parliament during a war, to beg him, to play with him in his schemes, to threaten to resign... he has to run the country, to govern it and in time of war to protect it.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, rest, crying emotions.
He's the first minister of Ukraine.
What about the ham?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
Sylvester Stallone's The Three Musketeers made less than $30 million on a $90 million budget in the U.S. and Sin City: The Woman I Want to Kill only made $12 million on a $70 million budget.
The Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz only made $14.6 million in its opening weekend, and kids' movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a box office disappointment.
According to a Telegraph article by film critic Robbie Collin, the quality of children's films is the culprit.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year ever for children's films" and called "How to Train Your Dragon 2" merely a "functional sequel".
When it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer movie releases shown in at least 2,000 theaters between VFW and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
Some commentators say this may be due to a change in viewership and the increased popularity of internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing".
We have to face it and not try to chase after what's already been.
In contrast with the current Hollywood box office slump, Netflix's net income from its Internet services reached $1.2 billion, almost double its $837 million profit last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book rights, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his disastrous prediction may be true.
With the release of potential big box office hits in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Outer Limits and Jurassic World, other numbers in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest box office summer in history and nobody will have to worry about sales".
North Korea threatens Seoul again, firing another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul has announced.
The alleged missile test came shortly after the conclusion of a joint US-South Korean military exercise that Pyongyang sees as preparation for an invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the DPRK on the border with China.
The South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a range of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea has apparently fired its first missile from Chagang Province, South Korean media reported, citing military sources.
I'm told there's an underground launching pad for Scud missiles in the province.
This is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to participate in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough was monitoring the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be flown from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police about 8:00 p.m.
A search and rescue team was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11:00 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell, hitting his head.
The officers stayed overnight with them and were picked up Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stabilized condition by ambulance.
Olomouc brought back from Opava only a point, the win was on the leg of Vashecek
The 23-year-old forward had a choice, but he missed his two biggest chances.
The goal was called by a shot close three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on goalkeeper Opava Josef Kveton.
I had it in my leg, I have to take chances.
I'm angry with myself", he poured your ashes on his head.
"Maybe I should have put it higher under the lid, I'm a little tired", he mused.
Sigma's defense didn't allow Opava much, except for Mikul's attack in the 11th minute, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanaks started pushing, but the defenders did not let them in the block and the missiles were caught from a distance by Květon.
We were out there for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance was not changed by Vasicek, and it ended 0:0", regretted coach Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took a point due to absences in the squad, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík were missing, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike their previous policies, it did not allow them to take office.
The substitutes deserve a discharge.
Sigma looked more like football, but we didn't let it do anything except one standard", said coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably well deserved, the point is a decent win for us", he added.
Sigma is tied at four points, which puts them in 13th place.
Nothing that would satisfy the club's boss, Josef Lebr, who after losing to Znojm, conditioned his million-dollar contribution to the treasury on diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. LeBron's warning, so there can be no question that the boys don't want to fight", Kalvoda remarked, adding to the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall there.
But after the first goal, I'll replace him so he can save goals for the next games", laughed Kalvoda.
Al Pacino has twice been a fan of Venice.
The film festival is in crisis
After the enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu was suddenly among the serious contenders for the Golden Lion, the next few days seemed to have seen a slight decline in interest in the 71st edition of the Venice Film Festival.
Whether it's because the seating capacity in the largest theater has increased to 14, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films like the 1960s documentary about the Indonesian genocide, A Look at Silence and other social films from American 99 Homes to Iranian Tales, theaters have been left empty.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet outside the festival palace has not yet been as crowded as in the past and it is no longer a problem to get a hotel room at the last minute.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has affected such respected institutions as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis is not a lack of personalities, but a lack of people who are present only in relation to the movies.
While younger fans were eager for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations without distinction, the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino has become a highlight.
He's also been in two movies.
In the story of the out-of-competition "Prosperity", adapted by Oscar-winning filmmaker Barry Levison from the novel by Philip Roth, 74-year-old Pacino plays a role that is close to his heart: a star at the height of his fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the eccentric hardware store owner from a small rural town in the movie Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for best performance by an actor should not be missed - but does an artist of Pacino's format still need awards?
Perhaps his greatest satisfaction is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly proclaims the country his grandparents came from.
Points for Italy
Italian cinema is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film since Birdman to be rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the Mafia is seen through the eyes of family relationships between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director managed to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actors.
He was also intrigued by the chamber psychological thriller Hungry Heart, directed by Saverio Costanzo and starring Alba Rohrwacher as a woman whose perverse anxiety nearly kills her own child.
In contrast, neither Ransom for Glory nor 3 Hearts, both of which cling to the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors, were warmly received by the French competition films.
But after all, two truly excellent films, Birdman and Black Soul, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival films are all about depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy that premiered in Venice out of competition and was filmed in the style of 1940s American comedy, managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police arrested four meth manufacturers in Prague, smuggling drugs from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug meth between November last year and August this year on Prague 9", police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the task force in the Zihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The next day, detectives detained another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior approval of the prosecutor.
The last of the four was caught by police in the early hours of Wednesday, August 20 at the Malaysian incineration plant", the spokeswoman said.
A woman was given a third of the drugs for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide range of interests.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment on Koněvová Street and in other places on Prague 9, he produced perfitein, provided various tools and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of pseudoephedrine medicines from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug he produced, packed it into plastic bags, and sold the methamphetamine.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman who had not yet been charged with drug trafficking or selling drugs to drug addicts.
She was rewarded by the organiser with a third of the drugs she produced", added Rössler.
The forensic team also conducted several home searches on the judge's order, where they seized drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, payroll bags, syringes, hoses and other tools and items that experts believe could be considered complete methamphetamine production equipment.
The dealer has been grounded seven times since 1995 .
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes seven times since 1995 and the woman had not been convicted", the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was given a suspended sentence for sexual abuse in 2006, and the 37-year-old mechanic, who is wanted on parole, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
His was mostly property crime, too.
The investigator has charged three men and a woman with the crime of illicit manufacture and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, which carries a penalty of up to ten years in prison.
The investigator eventually submitted a motion for detention to the prosecutor for three people, where the judge eventually placed them", the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, has been released.
His position and role in this case were not as crucial as those of the other defendants.
The officers are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess games made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things at very 'interesting' prices in its other products.
A good example is handmade chessboards in Italy with a playing board measuring 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, have more than $40,000 prepared.
The exact price is CZK 43 405.
The customer receives a set of wooden figures painted black and red and stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, instead of the classic rider, players have a figure of a climbing horse.
If chess does not seem like a valuable gift, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (handmade, of course) in a scale of 1:1:8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318 305.
Disrupting high schools and colleges doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few people with general education and statistics show that high school students are well employed.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There's been a lot of preparation going on in the schools over the last two weeks.
It's usually routine, like moving the flower pots from the summer storage back to the classroom and plowing the chalk.
They'll have a little more room at the Magical Gym.
A few days before the season begins, they pick up furniture, computers, and other technical equipment, as well as literature for the library.
No robbery or embezzlement has taken place, the four-year high school in Horicie reopens after three years and resumes its activities.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the incompetence of the founders.
They had to wait for the school to be certified by being listed in the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
"The French Socialists should shut up and put France in order", says key ally of Francois Hollande
Valls calls on the deeply divided left to show its support for a militant socialist president whose new distribution of powers has not met with the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stand by him", he said, and received a round of applause.
In a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour workweek, despite passionate arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who earlier this week proposed relaxing the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to remain "in solidarity" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, crossed the line when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, criticizing the Socialist Party for making the French lose faith in the future.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right conservative party, laughed at the constant internal strife among the Socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and so is Prince Manuel Valls, forced to form a new government when the previous one didn't last the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter", Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win an early election and that she was ready to run the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right won the European Parliament elections in May.
According to a poll by the weekly Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before Holland's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon run out of patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and reducing record unemployment.
It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing, he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limit Prague to elections
The changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new management of the capital.
No more arcades will disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on dog showers.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant decrees in the Chamber of Deputies before the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on changes should not be made by the current city leadership, whose mandate expires in a few weeks", said councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls have decided to ban gambling on their territory, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the games won't go away, the gambling ordinance won't change yet.
It's the job of the new city administration after the election.
Now we wouldn't even be able to do it technically because of, for example, deadlines for comments and so on,' explained Manhart.
He added that the last meeting of the current cabinet, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will be held on 11 September.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is being held on the day of the municipal elections in the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, gambling is banned in, for example, Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The same reasons will not change the decree for street art, so-called busking.
This is particularly the complaint of Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the Magistrates' Court to extend the current list of prohibited sites.
Prague 5 doesn't want musicians around Angel either.
The city has been working on a dog marriage ordinance for months, but it's not finished yet.
The location of the arcades and the busking issue are governed by city ordinances.
Only the representative of the capital city may issue or edit them.
The councillors have only an advisory vote, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week he put victory for Scottish independence within reach
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making that mistake a third time when it almost put the question on billboards across Scotland, "Do Scots want to be rich?"
But you don't win the hearts of the Scottish electorate by appealing to their wallet, nor do you earn their respect by threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots are far more likely to drive the money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they vote.
Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, and so in a televised debate he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and to start supporting a single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with a grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
However, the discussion about what Scotland's currency would be was more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and defending public healthcare that is free to the public.
Darling supported the London bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of health care.
By, as Salmond put it, "going to bed with the conservatives".
That's a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Tories.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to the voters but to the bosses' association, the Confederation of British Industry.
It's becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly, absentee housekeeper.
The Scots would respect him if he came to debate the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost like physical pain.
What he's saying is clear: Scots must not jump and accept what is.

The end was the best vacation ever, the last week of no going anywhere and just lying and floating with Grandma in the summer, the calm before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes, if you can get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, now in its 50th, riding a bicycle up the mountains around the Imperial, all the way back behind Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun caressing my back and shoulders, beaming goodbye.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still holiday mode, sleeping until 11:30, in a week it will be worse, the moments before sleeping will extend from a few minutes to two hours, then wake up in the morning at 7:30.
He's coming on Monday.
It's not usually raining, but it's the opposite. Summer is a mean time for school.
To float in the ghostly light onto a slab and feel like a plastic figure in a glass scale, there's that school, the AHS.
A western with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a couple of new ones, boys bigger, girls bigger.
There are bad guys to avoid, but it's interesting how they stick together and how early they get here.
And these grown-up girls who came screaming, they're laughing hysterically about something, I guess their lives changed over the holidays, while mine are just fine.
And again, freshmen, some nervous and some excited, why are they even climbing up here?
Because he has to, military training is mandatory.
So, inside, the cool dampness of the floor and the slight smell of disinfectant, the poisoned schoolmaster with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who supposedly lends the student the keys to the tin cupboard where they can keep the textbooks, which are still so scarce.
For the bottle.
The smell of the brown stays in the memory, it's not happening now, it's nice and airy, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
Just thinking about it makes your stomach cramp and your head hurt.
A head that will take even worse from the mathematics lesson, that devil's game for the chosen, of which I am not and never will be.
Again, the C's and the F's, the Godfather Fives, hiding from the exam, fitting in to the bench and doing the best you can to be sublime, being there and not being there, existing only as a name in the classroom and dreaming of stories of nicer girls and nicer buildings, of antennas into space where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and shakes anyone's foot.
The longest year has ten months.
And it's only day one, just like years ago.
She let her unborn daughter die.
She 's facing a very serious punishment .
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet booth at a bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, she gave birth to a baby girl, who, after having her umbilical cord cut, she wrapped in a prepared blanket, hid under her jacket, and carried to a roadhouse, where she laid her in bushes several dozen yards from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school.
I guess I just got it a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I had the baby.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut my umbilical cord with scissors I wore to school", the defendant said, explaining that she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she returned to the scene, put the body of the baby in a backpack and drove away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs at her grandmother's house in Havlíčková Broda", the lawsuit says, adding that it is not clear when the newborn died.
It could be within minutes or hours of birth, asphyxiation by covering with a blanket or putting it under a jacket, hypothermia, or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated the following spring.
A woman gave birth secretly again between February and April 12, when the body of a child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčekobrodsk.
This time in the bathroom of the penthouse in the family home.
Without checking that the baby was alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around the neck, she put the baby in several plastic bags, including a plastic bag, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his then-partner were taken to a pond.
Finally, her friend betrayed her.
The father of both children was the defendant's boyfriend, who was allegedly unaware of the partner's pregnancy.
For this reason, he is not now on trial, only punished for a violation of the law on funeral rites.
It was also he who later turned himself in to the police.
I don't like him not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the baby against my will.
I know my decision was wrong, but it seemed human at the time", said the defendant, who was allegedly submissive and fearful of the man.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke with a degree of composure.
She was moved to tears when she spoke about her relationship with her parents, whom she left when she came of age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every two weeks, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it", she sobs.
I didn't get the kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was gonna put him in a baby box, but I don't know what happened, I didn't.
I can't explain it to you", she told the judge.
She refused to act with intent to kill a newborn.
The second child, she claims, was stillborn.
But she didn't stop drinking alcohol during her pregnancy.
I've narrowed it down, though.
And she didn't drink hard.
I even cut back on smoking", she said.
Although her pregnancy was obvious in both cases, she told everyone, even repeatedly, that she had health problems, that she was dehydrated.
And so is my friend.
The main hearing will continue at the Castle Court on Tuesday with the testimony of the forensic experts.
The verdict could be out by Wednesday.
The woman faces up to 18 years in prison, or an extraordinary sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world's third largest cruise operator, has advanced negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately USD 3 billion.
The transaction would allow Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of USD 6,8 billion that competes with the larger rivals Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and wealthy clientele.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but cautioned that negotiations may still not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources didn't want to be named because the hearing is not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenues of USD 1,2 billion in 2013, up 6% on the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies like China and India in the coming year.
The companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties.
Apollo has owned a majority stake in the company since 2007 following a $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a 28%, Apollo 20%, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documents, the first public offerings of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the volume of North American passengers.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activists provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote
Nearby stood a group of people loyal to Beijing waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of three candidates will run in the 2017 Hong Kong election.
All candidates must first gain the support of a nominating committee, which will likely be made up of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and force pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge to cripple Hong Kong's financial hub of the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with Chinese leaders concerned that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June that cast a shadow over Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election in a special administrative district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Premier Li, is being organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Zhang Ronghsun, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists have announced that they will gather outside the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a Russian newspaper report, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the breakaway areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's remark was not intended to imply that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered to give the Russian-speaking region the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with an apparent strategy it has followed since the unrest erupted five months ago: help the separatists occupy territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant de facto independence to the newly proclaimed Novorossiya so that it can join Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state TV channel 1, Putin condemned Ukraine's military actions to retake the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass quoted Putin as saying that anyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon is a prisoner of illusion, because Ukrainian politicians have launched campaigns ahead of the October 26 parliamentary election, while government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters but also on the political organisation of society and the status of state sovereignty in south-east Ukraine, he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was intended in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for months, to ease concerns in Russian-speaking regions about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
In the meantime, he has been involved in the repression of the 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin spokesman's action, which was intended to correct a "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks, highlighted the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population of two million is ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and public opinion polls conducted before the conflict showed broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have been negotiating in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main naval fleet, maritime trading facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also a centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural address on June 7, proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from the Kremlin and the separatists, who accuse Moscow of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals follows another rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This has accelerated a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a metallurgical port with a population of 500,000, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching a point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - the leaders called for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a more unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week earlier in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the photo-leak scandal.
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence went viral in the biggest celebrity hacking scandal ever.
The hacker claims to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The iCloud leak also allegedly leaked personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and released to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told the online newspaper that the hack was "shameful" and that those who were targeted "feel humiliated".
It's believed the hacker obtained 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her topless swimming pool break-ins.
Palmer appeared in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the TV series Chuck Strahovski and actress of the thriller Sucker Punch Browning have not commented on the stolen footage yesterday.
Lawrence's representative at TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods".
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigma football team has made peace with the Leopard, even without a win.
The thunder and lightning that Sigma co-owner Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week seems to be a thing of the past.
If Opava had only brought a point for a goalless draw.
They've made a little of the club boss's efforts and their fighting.
The club could be getting some paychecks soon.
"I'm going to save one more game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic", confirmed LeBron, saying that although Sigma didn't win, the players convinced him of their improved performance.
The fighting and the dedication we showed, especially in the second half, was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm willing to forgive him for not winning.
If we had played like this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we wouldn't have lost yet", thinks Lepre.
Sigma in Opava, they took the pressure off the home team, then they tied the game and they were better in the second half.
After Kalvodo's victory, the defenders reached out, but they didn't get their chances to the goal, so they couldn't win.
The result is not what we expected.
We were only missing one changed chance to be completely satisfied", said Lébr, who does not think that his threat alone caused the change in the attitude of the players.
There must have been more than one aspect.
Whether it's on my side, on the coach's side, or the fans' side", said the Leopard.
Sigma has to deal with pressure.
The players didn't want to comment on last week's events after the game in Opava.
I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.
I tried not to admit it", said the young goalkeeper, Michal Reichl.
Without comment, the forward Václav Vasiček left a question about Lebro's statement from last week, which did not change Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's game.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We're going to be under constant pressure.
Everybody's trying to get to us.
Today we showed that if we fight and we all go to the bottom, we can do it", he said.
Heeding the Warning
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that preparing for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys have realized that, and today it was clear that they took Mr. LeBron's warning to heart.
Even before that, it wasn't that they didn't want to fight and slack off", said the coach from Olomouc.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to get used to the toughness and realize what the second league is all about.
That it's not just about football, but mainly about the fighting", Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next few games, the Sigma will be working from the beginning.
"I'd like to believe that", he added.
