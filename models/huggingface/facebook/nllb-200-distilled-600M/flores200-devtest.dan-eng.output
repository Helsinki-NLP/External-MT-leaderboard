This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feather of this animal was chestnut brown at the top with a bright or carpet-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cabinet called a feathercase, but have other features of feathers - rays and beams - the researchers concluded that feathers were likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or ornamentation, and the researchers thought that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feathered animal, not a chicken's dune.
The researchers believe that the tail sample of the young dinosaur shows the feathered features of an adult individual, not a chicken's tail.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and wounding more than 20 others.

The light intensity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic torsion.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon moves on Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers concluded that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and is made up of lots of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter shall place the envelope on the ballot and sign the ballot.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988, voting towers have been transparent, so that voters and observers can see that the ballot box does not contain ballots at the start of the vote and that no ballots are added other than those correctly presented and from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process.

The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and appearance, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "journalists seem to be wary of publishing pictures of suspects and so forth".
Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has hinted to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders of before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is supposedly sacred to both countries, and the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
The additional pest control experiment was closely monitored by park rangers as the experiment was monitored and its effects evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS's acting director of conservation and cultural heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In some 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it had knowledge of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Department said no damage was reported in the nation.
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who was going to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight cameras on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died at night with two moons, quite unique, just like herself, strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as I was... perhaps even more... loves her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to combat his pain, since it is forbidden during the course of medicine.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political snitch talk and stupidity".
People are wondering if he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to enable flight controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is introduced and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
Fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that you would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would have taken much longer because of the mating of the endemic Darwin-finned geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator using red cloves juice.
The colour of the juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of sulphur ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brindles are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a sort of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house,
Fossils of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would sit together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists are using telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Among them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat the much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, terpenes, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The flock consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The Huns are usually closely related and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leo herds react much like wolves or dogs in herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (but not well), swim, jump long and pull at five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a sentence of snarling, shouting words.
The ocelot prefers small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ozelotters follow and find animals to eat (battle) by sniffing at where they have been on earth.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly around.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our houses out of plants and we make our clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth and an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water, even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex, nothing could resist it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, fowl, lizards, and a type of rodent called a seven-legged rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men enjoyed large feasts together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open dishes facing the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled by few people, and Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if it says something on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" appear at the bottom of the document when turned over.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inch x 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the marking was merely added as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - which is French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture divided by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and it also defines the size of society in some way.
The urban states are the forerunners of nations, and a civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with the Congress as the sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, they were dependent on government authorities, often uncooperative in enforcing all acts.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all States before they could be amended, and the States took so lightly on the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with Germany's national football team, and became FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as an 'island group'
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island, as they passed by.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which began a change in the original grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been re-established, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the world's most common still photography format is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are similar to or close to this image format.
The very abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining some order in the picture.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become prosperous and influential, was closely examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European lands despite their different languages and customs.
Its omnipotent power affected everyone from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after the hostilities broke out, Britain launched a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching the border, a blockade that was contrary to the recognised international laws codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the sea, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations tended toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his former job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period or family in power was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of instability between each dynasty and the divided provinces, the most famous of which was the three-reign period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to occupy the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond worldly life, and he used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to delve into his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
Only the clear sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen, and very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of all), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow mark looks like a V and the down-bow mark looks like a sticker, or a square that lacks its bottom.
Up means you start at the top and push the bow, and down means you start at the seed (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
As a rule, upswing produces a softer sound, while downswing sounds louder and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the recorded arcs are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a shouting crowd of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob presented the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war effort of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprofits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context underlying the founding of the order.
The period of time during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and the way they are expressed in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many own cars, there are also more road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
During the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, which were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the modern world's capital of fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known to have been an epicenter of luxury since about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1,100 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily inspired by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow channels of communication, Western styles could fall backwards by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to attach clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic by age, ethnic background, social class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that govern a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children have not been socialized by adults in their childhood through failure, accident or deliberate neglect.
Some wild children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this childish failure was caused by a parent's rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical weakness.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to that of the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, placement goes one step further.
Setting up is not a learning method but a support for people who need to learn something new - for example, using a new computer program or starting a project.
Standby can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of standby, but it's the little clipper guy in Microsoft Office, too.
Virtual placements are internalised in the software and aim to question, request and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our care family system must provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all the necessities that were not present in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "during relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in understanding microwave imaging, which is facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess honesty with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added by mutation and removed from the pool of exact variations by selection.'
Separation and recombination blends the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of noncompliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless prepared.
Conversely, animal food ( ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to your senses without awakening you completely.
If you find yourself turning off the watch while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to stand up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known water thinner) before bed, forcing one to get up and let go of the water.
The amount of inner peace a person has is the exact opposite of the amount of tension a person has in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality, and all people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the love path Mahayana and a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga exercises, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga, where the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created through the visualization of various deities.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought seriously by alternate armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost obsolete from day to day as over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and established the White and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The task of the fleet has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and goods, while affecting your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to ship troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could easily access milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Sheep were generally kept in flocks that walked on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goats, often children or teenagers, equivalent to more widely known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the railways were made of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the somewhat more uneven roads of the day.
The shovels were invented early enough to keep the tracks in place, but eventually they realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first metal-only skins were used.
The first known method of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually rise.
Two-legged specialisations exist in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like treating symptoms, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congressman John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his soldiers in New York City.
The 25 Dunlap Arcs that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There's a lot about birds that remind me of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, like 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits -- or bits, for now, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression comes from ancient knowledge of wall lice, insects that live largely as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are non-nidiocal, meaning they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in the best interests of them or their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually used in most scientific studies.
But it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek faded, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms other than responses to external periodic signals have been documented in most living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue a period of free-flowing cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacterial phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, where they either marked the DNA in the radioactive phosphorus field or the protein in the radioactive sulfur field.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape and the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and park visits, as well as studies of ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has released the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly for the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the day flea are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were differing opinions about his theory - some believed that he was right, while others believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the earth spinning, can we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on earth, containing over eight times as much water as the second largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, reaching up to six miles [9.6 km] wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 miles [3,980 km] long.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were perhaps a thousand years old.
The Vatican State has a population of about 800, the smallest independent country in the world, and the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of the state's workers, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle held that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is a basic mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the end of this sentence.
That's why most people thought the pencil was a good friend when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now text through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil.
You can only guess what's going to be left of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down under little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made of stone and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The hull is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar gardens on the front, since the crust here is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is centered on finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
Theories investigate what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can occur when a manager starts to lead his former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she needs to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The expectations for expertise for virtual teams are the same as for conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organisation's functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, which narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models with which to help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI includes the ability to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and timing, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been incorporated into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom, and often a teacher would love to take his students to places where they cannot travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions, allowing students to view museum objects, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital each year, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions are still available online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become smarter in the world around them". The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active responses to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of these and many others highlight Ontario as what is considered genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Further north are large areas of relatively sparsely populated land, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected to France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers say they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It makes sense to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look like an animal.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or no, that's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as rooftops, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide variety of nips, but it is very touristic.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located to the east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the battles taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle tax) to get around Goma.
Along with the relative unavailability of the city, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote areas.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of Desert Storm.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees to the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
The skyline of Hong Kong is a group of buildings that, reflected in the water in Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column diagram.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon Harbour Front on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps  they include some of the last remaining deposits of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/sea areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 chitalhorts in the area.
Buses run from the cross-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, both comfortable and rugged.
Deletasas are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011. It opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world as well as some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is taking place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can consult the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is fixed at the equivalent of the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be used in the outlying islands, although British and American currencies may be available; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; temperatures in the summer months are usually above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainful" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] away from all other wildlife!
No matter how delicate they may appear, bison, elk, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep proper distance.
Also, be aware that smell attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port formed the framework of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruise ship, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally took place in the city, resulting in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea.
The most common local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It's certainly safe to drink the local tap water, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign: a short black coffee is called espresso, a cappuccino has plenty of flavor on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and people rarely get damaged on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and follow the advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea urchins occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the sea, their primary habitat being in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often offer specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport/flight transport arrangements or even combined air and hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival participants choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be where it's going, you have to get in early to get a tent near the music.
Remember, even if the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're going to cross the Baltic Sea in the winter, check your cabin, because sailing through ice can be pretty loud for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms), which is interesting to know, as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do their best to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and windows and watches are usually absent, making it difficult to find an exit.
They usually offer special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and in the house.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered at the house's expense, but drunkenness weakens judgment, and all real gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who is driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice and minus.
On icy and smooth roads, there is low friction, and you cannot drive as you would normally on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to get you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by falling or bloating snow or by condensation or ice on the rudders of the vehicle.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly slides smoothly throughout the year.
Safari is the highlight of many and perhaps the most attractive tourist destination in Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travel to see the beautiful wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, geese, and leopards are sometimes clouded, and you can better see them with a broom.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "go-safari" or "foot safari") consists of hiking trips that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and your accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could get into trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a dryer and a dryer board that can be borrowed even if there is no dryer in the room.
If you do not have the option of using a hair dryer, or if you do not like to wear socks that are shaved, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the substance get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans, are not normally considered pests.
Customs-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers who travel to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the backcountry.
If you are not used to driving on the highway, beware: steep hills, narrow lanes and steep bends are abundant.
The speed limits set are significantly lower than on stretches before and after  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important than usual to observe them accurately.
Strangely, cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common: apples are baked in cakes all year round, and cherries and flowers appear during the summer.
In addition, many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small but full-bodied cakes, you can try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in carrot dishes, while in southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, when used without further ado, the term typically refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the island group; it consists of a number of single spicy dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stairs are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can cause safety problems because of the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls from his horse but has one foot stuck in the ladder, he may be dragged away if the horse runs away.
First, many riders wear saddle-toed boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English ones, have safety pins that allow the saddle brackets to be loosened if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as Yosemite in South America, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain tops offer all visitors stunning views from the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve riding down snow-clad terrains with skiing or a snowboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "boaters" - planning their entire holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C. show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, skating or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not involve, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, which is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skiing and boots.
You should see the scooter as if it were a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than walking  but very rarely do you get the same speed as on a long-distance without a heavy backpack and on clear tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances a trip through several countries would require repeated visa applications and passport checks.
In this context, however, the Schengen area acts almost as one country.
As long as you're in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, you do not need to apply for a separate Schengen visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be classified as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Refinery is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami people with other occupations.
Although traditionally, not all Samis kept great reindeer, they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and used the reindeer mainly as pets.
Today, many Samis are working in modern occupations.
Although the word "Gypsies" is often used especially among non-Romans, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions are issued in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may be facing a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often broad and simplified compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage or serious social disturbances or cost human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur worldwide and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall and forest fires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, clouds and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, avalanches, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in a hostile environment" will likely give the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they bring valid documents for their return trip.
Governments' willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing unidentified gender passports (X) or documents updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies equally.
Security inspection visits have also become more urgent in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not undergone surgery should not expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the beach, often at a reef or equivalent, is called a countercurrent.
Because of the underwater topology, the return course is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow into deep water can be formed.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it's no harder than swimming back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and if you've been discovered, you might be able to wait for rescue.
Home shock comes faster than culture shock (which is not a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who were easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a whole new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect to be patient and understanding when returning home as travelers.
The Pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You're always hearing the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The sphinx is set in the background and tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active by 2020.
The island group is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains meet at the top of the ridge and form the 360-kilometer-long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range is home to Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif (also known as Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have free access to the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular among those planning a sabbath is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising on their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your sabbatical year can actually improve your chances of getting a place in higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programmes.
Finland is a wonderful destination for sailors. The "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and islands along the coast.
In the islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, a smaller boat or even a kayak is a different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, then go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go to the country with boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help them overcome a fear of the unknown or of not being in control.
Delivery companies are well paid to deliver quickly, and time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were air freight, some routes may have taken days to get through reading and customs.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage, which airlines don't allow to send baggage without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to put a big pile of money on the line to get the opportunity (or even better, get your company to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price of economy class for business class and eleven times the price of first class!
In general, there is no need to look at all for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-declared Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not trim the place with markings or by graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish, with about half preferring to speak Catalan, most of whom understand it, and almost all of whom speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
General subway notifications are made in Catalan only, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automatic system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to still behave as nicely as possible, to behave like someone who is "bien élevé".
The cool exterior of Paris will evaporate quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forested areas - mostly with oaks and conifers - and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and birds.
Here, along with many more common species, rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, louse, wildcat and bull are found.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees while also having their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries have women's veils that appear unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially those of bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not be completely safe wearing these parts.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses a lot of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any kind of accessory available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a phrase or an adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronouncing is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel.

Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is reminiscent enough that they do not need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and are left as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Watching the flowering cherry trees known as Hanami has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from flower trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossoms were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from around the world have adopted many of the traditions of the holidays.
It is customary to stay awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise in an isolated location.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter celebrations on Saturday evenings during Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking out at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main herbivore of the Galapagos.

If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the polar lights, as the sky will be dark more or less 24 hours a day.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
