This not only facilitates the growth of hair on some of the finest dinosaurs, which is a common feature of the eye, but also produces highly organized structures with a complex, triangular shape and eyes that are not easily visible from above.
The researchers say that the animal's genome is not on the surface of the tree, but rather on the carotenoid surface of the tree.
