Scenarios of modeling linked to healthcare capacity, with estimates in each EU country and UK for the prevalence of COVID-19 sleep-necessity cases associated with a risk of over 90% increase in capacity in ICU beds, are included in the ECDC's sixth update of the Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
As cases are common in the EU and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units serve the population of a particular region, information on cases and intensive care beds is best taken from the regional unit terminology for Level 2 (2-NUTS) statistics.
The experience of Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 virus is spreading rapidly in the EU and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for a scenario of continuous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the community as well as an increasing number of COVID-19 cases requiring healthcare and in some cases intensive care, as is currently occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
The latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment indicates that a comprehensive, active and rapid approach is needed to delay the spread of the coronavirus 2-SARS-COV, with the methodology shifting from suspension to slowdown, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases will not allow full time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, respond to and adapt to their responses if and when they do.
Rapid risk assessment and public health measures to assess the impact of the pandemic.

2019-19-COVID pandemic, caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV) respiratory syndrome (SARS) has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other countries worldwide, which could be catastrophic for humans.
Just like its own virus, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which infected thousands of people in 2003, the new SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been transmitted from mosquitoes and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but a much higher transmission rate and affects older men and men more than young women.
This article provides a timely and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing field of study in response to the growing number of publications related to this new disease.
We discuss the basic principles of pathology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of the disease.
Although most of the questions are still unanswered, we hope that this assessment will help us understand and prevent this dangerous disease.

By then, the population had spread rapidly in the surrounding cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infection was reported among healthcare staff and it was reported that the disease was capable of human-to-human transmission.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

By the time of this report, the disease had spread to all parts of China and some 50 countries worldwide. (Fig. 2.2)
As the situation is rapidly developing, the latest range and intensity of integration remains open.
February 11, 2020 A multidisciplinary study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 showed a new picture of the generalization as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but most are between the ages of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50, very few under 20 and only 14 cases under 10.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among males was higher (0.31/100,000) than among females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 symptoms generally develop in the Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (9-2) days to be diagnosed.
The mean time between infection and onset of the disease is 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.

The initial genital value (R0) of the disease was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted genital value of R0 was 4.82-2.32.
The number of cases increased significantly before December 23, which coincided with the massive traffic and public transportation before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate among all confirmed cases was 3.06% (95% CI:2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (over 60), and acute respiratory syndrome.

In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the glycoprotein (S) is sequentially transferred to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and the receptor's dipeptide peptide 4 (DPP4) converting enzymes, whereas membrane coagulation occurs.
The RNA genome of the virus is released into the cytoplasm; after the virus's genome is duplicated, the genetic RNA with the glycoproteins and nucleosaccharide proteins form the virus' vesicles which then merge with the plasma membrane to kill the virus.

Despite this, how the central cell helps the virus break through the species barrier and transmit it to humans remains undetected and the route of transmission still needs to be clarified.
G and colleagues, Marianne, defined the virus as a transfer from bats to humans that forms a synthesis similar to the S-type protein.
According to a study, researchers from the Chinese National Zoo, suggested that pangolin - a mammalian mammal and primarily a herbal medicine derived from traditional Chinese medicine - may be the central host of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus because it has 99% genetic similarity between the virus found in the Pangolin and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Despite this, the 1% genetic difference between the two viruses is still a large difference, and therefore, stronger evidence is expected to yield definitive results. (Fig. 33.)
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been fully determined.

Therefore, we can only refer to previous research on coronaviruses, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Generally, after the virus attacks its cell, it is first identified through the cell's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type identification receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor, and RIG-I-type receptor (RLR).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In the same way, the SARS-CoV N protein helps the virus escape the immune response.
Pretty soon, the appropriate immune response will be accompanied by a virus.
T lymphoma in which CD4+CD8+T cells play an important role in metabolism.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to viruses and CD8+T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells are intended to help immune cells produce pre-infectious cytokines.

According to a survey of 425 first cases in Wuhan, the estimated time to emerge for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days.
In the same case, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the average onset was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
Recent studies, as well as those described above, indicate that the incidence of the disease was 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days according to the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to determine effective quarantine times according to the most precise time of onset, so that transmission of the virus from an infected person without symptoms can be prevented.
As a normal practice, people who are infected or exposed to other patients are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Does the quarantine period need to be extended to 24 days?

In severe cases, the disease can develop rapidly into respiratory problems, hypertension, acute myeloid leukemia and hypertension.
Patients with symptoms of up to and/or high respiratory and pneumonia, even if their lung radiation does not show abnormal symptoms, should be screened for early detection of the virus.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that 98% of patients had up to, 76% had dry throat, 55% had difficulty breathing, 3% had diarrhea and 8% had need of a respirator.
Two recent studies on a family trait and a transfer trait in an individual without symptoms yielded similar results.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic census showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had a major symptom (98%) up to, (47%) dry throat, (55%) respiratory distress.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In SARS patients, it was found that up to (100%-99%), dry cough (75%-29%), shortness of breath (42%-40%), diarrhea (25%-20), and bronchitis (25%-13) were the main symptoms and that approximately 20%-14% of patients needed artificial respiration.

Comparatively speaking, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic survey, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47, i.e. 95% confidence interval (CI) was 7.23-5.71, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rate, and R0 or more is given in Table 1.1.
The above models suggest that the spread potential of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less deadly than the other two.

The initials are usually the same household or the same assembly or transportation equipment, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a pre-travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with their only infected or patients within two weeks of their onset.

In patients with acute infections, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin precursor found in the blood, increased and the amount of lymph nodes decreased significantly.
Abnormalities in chest radiation have been observed in most COVID-19 patients and are manifested as a shadow of a flattened or darkly-colored lump in the lungs.

The more radiation the patient has, the worse the disease will be.
18 February 2020  The first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed that killing of the pneumocytes, formation of the hyaline membrane, and the theft of interstitial lymph nodes, and synaptic lymph nodes in the lungs of patients who died from the virus, was equivalent to viral infection and ARDS and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.

A combination of prognosis, medical symptoms, laboratory tests, and diagnostic findings is required to achieve effective diagnosis and treatment.
14 February 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the SHERLOCK technique or CRISPR-based method to detect the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which detects the SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthetic strips within 20x10-18mol/L to 200x10-18mol/L (10-100 copies per microlytre extracted) with the acquisition of a single drop in less than an hour without the need for precise instrumentation.
We hope that this technique is new and, if proven, can make medical samples more sensitive and easily available.
In the absence of any experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can generally provide care for COVID-19 patients, while also using treatments previously used for other coronavirus patients such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases.
These treatments include currently used antiviral and hidden drugs, immune system stimulants, steroids, cured patient plasmas, Chinese drugs, and psychotropic supports.

Pharmaceutical companies are currently competing to make antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks the respiratory system and may also, to a lesser extent, attack organs containing ACE2, such as the intestinal and renal systems.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save patients' lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, ventilation, air conditioning, attacker ventilation, mechanical ventilation, as the disease progresses and becomes severe.
In patients with severe respiratory infections, ECMO (Extracorporeal Oxygenous Mapping) is a modified cardiac and respiratory bypass technique for treating a risky respiratory or cardiac defect.

Cytocin degradation is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is carried out by releasing a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines force immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is a major cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Corticosteroids and tosicillisombabs, and an anti-IL6 monoclonal antigen, have been used to treat cytokine poisoning.
Other immune system suppression therapies for treating cytokine deficiency include suppressing the immune system response to T-cell types, IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors and inhibiting JAK; Blinatomab; cytokine signaling inhibitor4; and activating HDAC.
Steroids, as an immune system stimulant, are widely used to treat SARS with the aim of reducing the severity of infectious diseases.
In addition, steroids taken in excess of a meal are not beneficial for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it can cause persistent side effects, particularly neuromuscular disorders, which can significantly affect the diagnosis of the disease.
In addition, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses are recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 who are unstable.
As of this writing, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed.

In fact, patients who recover usually have high levels of antibodies to fight pathogens in their blood.
Anti-tans are immunoglobulins (lg) produced by type Β lymphomas to fight pathogens and other external targets and detect and directly neutralize the unique molecules within the pathogen.

Symptoms recovered after 24 hours, and their infection and viral load decreased and their blood oxygen levels improved.
Confirmation and explanation are necessary to suggest the form and use on a large scale before any particular treatment can be developed.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related damage should be considered.
Antibiotics can, for example, boost the immune response to excess levels and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
Antibodies in the blood are normally low, and the demand for plasma for treatment of patients is high.
Developing and developing a specialised anti-nuclear that is fast enough to fight a global pandemic is challenging.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and finding their genetic code and encoding effective antibodies, or testing for antibodies that affect the virus protein, is critical and appropriate.
If this is done, we can easily develop the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various ailments in China.
However, its effects are largely dependent on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis based on TCM theories.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or unknown because it is difficult to extract and verify the proper composition of this form or mixture.
Today, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who are in the early stages of the disease and have recovered.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The highest rates of COVID-19 treatment were seen in several provinces in China where 87% of patients received their vaccine from TCM, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas in Hubei province of TCM only 30% of COVID-19 patients were treated, and the recovery rate was lowest (13%).

February 18, 2020  Boli ZHang and colleagues conducted a study on the comparison of Western medicine treatments (WM) alone
They found that the time needed to recover from body temperature, to lose symptoms, and to be hospitalized in the WM+TCM group was significantly less than in the WM-only group.
Significantly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
In addition, the capability and safety of TCM is still greater on a larger scale and more centrally capable of meeting well-controlled testing.

Compulsory exposure tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to COVID-19, can make people increasingly concerned and blamed about the impact of the pandemic, quarantine, and its effects on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects and people with whom they have been exposed, as well as for the general public.
Psychological support, the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear and explicit communication with regular and detailed updates on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional guidelines to prevent close contact between individuals, should be included.
Vaccines are effective in disrupting the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to early cell deaths and are often complementary to antiviral treatments to control the spread of infectious diseases caused by newly introduced viruses.

Conversely, cases and outbreaks of MERS still occur in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions due to the continuous sharing of resources between humans and animals in the endemic regions.
Strategies for MERS have been developed, by harnessing forced viruses, DNA plasmids, viral receptors, nanoparticles, viral-forming nuclei, and recombinant protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animals.
️Making a safe and effective virus against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus for non-proliferative isolates is a very urgent and important task in controlling the current pandemic.

As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its clinical cycle among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover easily without the disease of the parasite.

Therefore, creating a disease prediction model for disease is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially where resources are limited.
According to clinical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to COVID-19 patient prognosis (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in recovery from SARS as is COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred more frequently in people aged 65-30 years and in a study of 8,866 participants, 47.7% of patients were over 50 years old as described above.
The patients who needed close medical attention were more likely to have another disease and to have significantly older than others (with a median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age was a predictive factor in the outcome of COVID-19 patients.

Extraordinary laboratory results: Levels of C-type response protein (CRP) in the blood indicate severe infection or tissue damage and are a hidden predictor of disease, drug response, and eventual recovery.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In addition, elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to predicting outcomes.

Clinical Signs: To predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19, chest radiation and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered alongside other problems.
Steroid use: As mentioned earlier, steroids are a protective system and are often used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the risk of infection.
As a result of high-corticosteroid intake being widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors experienced bone marrow death and blood loss as well as decline and deterioration in their lifestyle.

Stress: Also previously reported, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experience extreme anxiety as most have been subjected to prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and have experienced the death of family members and friends.
Mental guidance and long-term support for these patients should be provided to help them overcome stress and return to normal life.

Although these actions have caused significant damage to the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases has been declining, which reflects a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most promising outlook is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward trend will last 4-3 months.
Despite this, some experts are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which is more likely to spread than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues created a model to predict the outcome of the disease, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was detected in two central turbinate regions and the bladder samples of patients who had recovered 2 weeks earlier and had left the hospital, suggesting that the newly detected virus could be a cyclical event like influenza.
In the same way, as the number of new cases decreases, promising signs have emerged in China, suggesting that current strategies may be effective.

A new study of 138 cases indicates that 41% of cases may be hospitalized, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care professionals.
Therefore, great secrecy is needed to protect humans, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even road users who have been exposed to patients and infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Chain No. 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face mask prevents the transfer of droplets from a hidden infected individual through the air or from contacting the surface of objects from which they can be transmitted to others.
Despite this, only the N95 mask (chain number 1860) can protect against small virus respiration from 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of viruses can be fully spread; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is about 85 nanometers.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In addition to masks, healthcare workers must wear adequate insulation covers to minimize exposure to viruses.
Virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.

Healthcare workers should therefore wear face masks and face masks when working with patients.
In public areas where people are infected, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with antiviral soap more than ever, stay home for quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
3 feet is a good distance to stay away from a sick person.

Although SARS-2 emerged as a novel virus for the world population, there are many similarities to the SARS virus that was first reported on 7/1/2020. It should have been a major cause of the (China) mutation.
Although, as of January 19, 2020, the CDC did not reassure the public that the virus had a limited spread rate from person to person, there was no problem preventing or preventing the disease.
The message effectively calmed the fear and panic of the people, especially as the whole country prepared for the Spring Festival, when the tide was lost to control and limit the disease to the minimum in Wuhan.

, for example, agencies and institutions should (1) be more vigilant when issuing public statements, as every word to their community can change their decision and behavior; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to non-communicable information, rather than waiting for official medical reports and official parties; (3) be more strict in limiting and controlling the epidemic in its early stages than making people comfortable; and (4) be more active and effective in exercising and raising public awareness of pandemics and in responding to and improving the response and response systems of society.
The outbreak of coronavirus-19 is caused by a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 that was launched in December 2019.

COVID-19 affects older people more than younger, men more than women, and the prevalence and mortality rates in older people are higher than in younger people.
SARS is more immortal than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients carry the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do the same when they have the disease, which makes it much more difficult and convenient to prevent and limit the spread of COVID-19 than in SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV-2.

Although 96% of the genes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of bats, it is still not possible to say that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was the intermediate in transmitting the virus from the original cell, say a bat to a human?
Without answering questions #1 and 2, we cannot actively stop the transmission and its effects, and the outbreak can occur anytime.
Although molecular biology and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how does the virus enter air cells and then cause disease-related mutations?

Different proteins use more non-base 16 proteins, which are denoted as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins, which include the S-head, E-volume, membrane M, and nucleoprotein N.
A number of the basic airway proteins, have been modified by the different bases of the CoVs.
Based on the different protein sequences, the coronavirus has been divided into 4 types, alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus, including beta-coronavirus, which is the most common type of coronavirus and is divided into 4 subtypes (C,B,A, and D).
Evidence has shown that bats and rodents perform the same genetic function as most coronaviruses alpha and beta, while birds are the primary sources of coronaviruses gamma and delta.

HCoV-229E and HCoV2NL63 alpha-coronavirus are among them.
The other 5 beta-viruses include: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause moderate symptoms, such as diarrhea and diarrhea and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be highly pathogenic, causing severe respiratory problems in most patients and are more likely to cause severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary embolism.
The first severe infection of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the respiratory tract of those with normal capital in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gathered through intensive research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which lead to the development of short-term symptoms.
Of course, it was widely accepted that infection with the coronavirus variant was usually as slow as SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in history, infecting more than 8,000 people, and resulting in a mortality rate of nearly 10%.
10 years later, the outbreak of "Middle East respiratory syndrome" caused a major outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula with a disruptive spread worldwide.
2019 Coronavirus, (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is a source of the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.

The seven HCoVs have a livestock base in bats, rats or domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the development of the baseline of all types of bats HCoVs, which are highly adaptive and non-surgical viruses, but have significant genetic differences.
2019 COVID-19 pandemic has posed major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Following the animal-related origins of HCoVs, we provide a framework for understanding the natural history, management power and the underlying causes of species leaping and mutation.
It may be a guide and facilitator for the host animal, the moderator and enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 with important and effective assistance in preventing future spread.
In this analysis, we provide a travel guide on animal-related causes, species-to-species transmission and patients with H-type coronavirus.
Specifically, we will diagnose and describe the general form of the coronavirus, which is not itself a disease in its own cell type, but becomes a disease after it is transferred to a new cell.

A summary of the history of coronavirus detection in chronological order, Table 1, will contain information and guidance.
The first HCoV-229E infection was isolated in 1966 from patients with respiratory distress, and subsequently developed in WI-38 lung cells.
HCoV-229E infections had normal symptoms, which included: headache, dizziness, fatigue and diarrhea, with a longevity that was seen in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCov-OC43 was isolated from the baseline and passage patterns of mammalian mice.
The symptoms and manifestations of HCov-OC43 infections appear to be the same as those that cause HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically curable in patients with acute respiratory illnesses, such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, primarily in the winter in cold weather.
The life cycle of these viruses is generally less than a week, followed by about two weeks of malnutrition.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people were infected with advanced HCoV-229E that is cold.
Only a few patients with severe immune deficiencies experience a urinary system defect.
SARS, also known as the vaginal fluid evaporation, was originally well documented as the source of human disease and SARS-CoV infection factor, the third HCoV to be discovered.

SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in 8,096 cases, with 774 deaths spread across countries and continents.
Despite its very rapid spread, it was predicted that each case would increase to two secondary cases and the life cycle would be 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral load would be achieved by the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV-2 patients initially develop muscle pain and headache, which are characterized by numbness and tingling, followed by numbness, coke and compassion as the last symptoms.
Lymphonia, which causes liver failure and elevated nitrogen levels in the urine, is a common laboratory emergency for SARS.
Pulmonary pain and diffuse malignant cells and macrophageal enlargement are observed in SARS patients.

In addition to the lower digestive system, many organs including the digestive system, liver and kidney are subject to heavy loads that always carry cytokine molecules that can be fatal to immunocompromised patients.

Corrhiza, brown eye movement and the upward movement of the retinal veins are the most common causes of HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study reported identical virus derivation from a sample of a 8 month old puppy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was detected in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of all infectious diseases, with incidences peaking in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the fungal infection also known as the herpes simplex virus.

Although pneumonia and pneumonia have been shown to be a contributing factor in the community and HCoV-HKU1 has been linked to severe rabies.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been detected worldwide and are a major cause of pulmonary hemorrhagic diseases.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are well-administered by humans and are essentially less likely to mutate and become a major cause of disease, although incidents have occurred for unknown causes as in a few rare cases of HCoV-NL63 secondary infections that have recently been revealed to be severe pneumonia in China.
Generally speaking, when these HCoVs are able to transfer to the human body and recover from the human body, they are also less lethal or disease-causing.
MERs-CoV was first detected in 2012 in Saudi Arabia in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed severe pulmonary embolism and had kidney failure.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases are in the Middle East, the weather conditions that are spreading are due to close exposure in several European countries and Tunisia.

MERS clinical phenomena are similar to SARS in that they have a development of acute pulmonary embolism.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients also suffer from acute renal failure, which separates MERS from the causes of HCoVs.

Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly and become respiratory.
Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are very close because of the high levels of the hormone chain, which is 82% in different branches, they are clustered together in phylogenetic sequences.

First, the life cycle and survival of HCoVs are highly intertwined.
SARS-CoV-2 is the second most common of the six HCoVs.
Second, severe symptoms of COVID-19 lie between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).

Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows the characteristic strains of both HCoVs and community-acquired SARS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Finally, the same as HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 can be found in contaminated samples.
Whether or not oral Sars COVID transmission plays a role in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some circumstances remains to be seen in future studies.
It is also important to know whether SARS-2 can occur in seasonal cases such as community-acquired HCoVs.
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to spread and spread after infection will affect the current outbreak of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs transmitted by the community cause the development of well-trained human-mediated symptoms.
In another study, it may also be true that humans have become well-trained with these four types of HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
HCoVs that cause disease in humans and those that have HCoVs that are infected with them have been eradicated.
To achieve this, HCoVs must increase in humans and reach levels sufficient to allow for the adaptation of the jump to allow for the replication of cell-negative factors.
The more SARS-CoV-2 spreads, the more people will be affected by the virus and the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If properly adapted, transmission to humans can be difficult due to quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, all four species of cobra collected by the community were transported to the population at regular intervals.

Conversely, the cause of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2 was not well adapted to human disease and their transmission to human disease was not continued.
They need to survive and spread from the host and return to the host for human purposes, possibly through one or more mediums and cell proliferation.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and to all four community-transmitted HCoVs.
High prevalence is similar to the HCoV currently transmitted by the local community.
Although, community-acquired HCoVs are more likely to cause illness.
remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and spreads out of the human body without a storage or cell of the host organism.

A virus can cause the cell to grow to HCoV if it is localized to a nearby precursor, which exchanges homology at the nucleotide chain level.
The progenitors of the virus always adapt well and are not transferred to the cell.

In both cases, the genes are inherently infectious and are inherently inherent to HCoV or to the pathogenicity of the virus.
Conversely, if HCoV identified itself as cellular mediation before or near identification with humans, it will not adequately adapt to new cell transmission and cause disease transmission.
These saline mediators can serve as a vital source of human infection and also play a role in the growth of saline cells by preventing the virus from spreading over time and then passing to humans to increase the risk of human infection.
HCoVs can pass through a closed pathway of infection if they cannot be able to catalyze their transmission through the midrib.
HCoVs, in contrast, can also adapt to moderate saline conditions and can even provide a long-term habitat.
In this case, the central salt cell becomes the natural salt cell.
Downward-through data is a kind of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological indicator that is linked to a living history.
Analysis of the number of cases shows that the LGG is more prevalent than the general population.
Masked cats (Pugma larvae) and dogs that run in bustling markets were initially known to transmit SARS-CoV as viruses that almost matched SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supported the fact that no SARS cases were reported after the extermination of all Pygma larvae from the markets.
Although it has been shown that the Pugma larvae are wild or those of the farm that have no contact with the market turmoil are more likely to be SARS-CoV-2 negative, this suggests that the Pugma larvae are only a breeding colony but not in the SARS-CoV-2 natural reserve.

All of these are considered to be the end of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
What sets the study apart is that it lays a blank on the cellular nature of SARS-CoV associated with the Cove bat, the term SARS is derived from the Rhinocerous Cove HKU3 (SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3) bat found in the Hiroshu bat in China.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This and other cove bats share a nucleotide balance chain with SARS-CoV with 88-92%.
The study has revealed a new idea that the parasite cells are the cause of human disease.
Several SARS-CoVs have been identified in bats, but only one known as WIV1 has been classified as a living virus.
Angiotensin enzyme convertor 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS coronavirus receptor.
WIV1 was derived from a mouse poison sample that showed ACE2 being used by bats and pygmy cats, larvae and humans as a receptor for cell motility.
What's more interesting is that SARS-CoV-2 recovery serums have the potential to inhibit the functioning of WIV1.
In this way, WIV1 shows the closest pre-coronavirus SARS correlation in bats, 95% of the nucleotide distribution in the symmetry chain.
The high similarity between the two viruses, however, has led to the general consensus that WIV1 is not the direct parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the direct cellular storage for SARS-CoV.

CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV benefit from the same cellular receptor, DPP4, for the virus's entry.
RNA random RNA Polymeric zinc RNAs in Mers-Cove are more closely related in biology to the similar corona in the blind Saturday found in Europe and Africa.
As of now, no Mars-Cove is detectable in the wild on Saturday.
Cov-HKU25 and its corresponding Cov-HKU25 are only about 87 percent nuclear fusion-linked.

Although, some cats still survive from the time when many cases of Mars have been reported and they have had no contact with previously symptomatic animals, it is likely that the source is human-to-human transmission or the means of transporting the unknown small animal that Mars-Cove had.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotides that are identical to COV-RaTG13 isolates from the renolof monoclonal nucleotides.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differential regulation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very good for family relationships.
As he put it, the blind Saturdays will not be an immediate destination for SARS-CoV-2 until known blinds are discovered in the future.

Some studies that have thick posts on metagenomic regulation (linked to genes) have suggested that a subfamily of mammals known as pangolin (linked to the genus Mainz Javannica) may also be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Cov genes of these new peptides give 85-92% sequence of nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2.
Although they are equally associated with RATG13 it is known to be 90% at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They assign two age lines to both SARS-CoV-2 collections as viruses within the genome tree, one of which most commonly transmits the major receptor (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97% of the amino acid sequence.
In complete contrast, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although a higher rate of sequence of genome equality with diffusion is present.
Previous research into pangolin disease has also suggested infection with viral DNA fragments from lung samples, which have been shown to be synonymous with SARS-CoV-2.
The study involved a different method and individual attention to genome sequencing was captured at 86.3% of total viral genome sequencing.

However, there is still no evidence available to determine the origin of the first SARS-CoV-2 penguin virus despite the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 penguin strains.
However, the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 neural networks is smaller than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 penguin similar to COVs.
The development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is largely inhibited by the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
The highest sequence homology found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and penguins, SARS-CoV-2 is related to beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is generally accepted that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 penguin related beta SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to be selective-development-compatible.
Contrast- Claiming the interest in the fusion between the SARS-CoV-2 penguin is related to beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third mountain animal.
As a developmental force, integration is widespread among Beta-Covs.

History of evolution has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCOv-229E are derived from the coronavirus of bats, when the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 family viruses have been detected in mammals.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Analysis of the evolutionary history has determined the incidence of transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCo-OC43 spread from organisms to humans through domesticated feces in the 1890s, a serious respiratory infection was reported.
HCoV-229E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Alpha-Covus bats are closely related to HCO-229E that have been discovered.
Among them is the Cove-Alpa alpa.

First, humans rather than alpacas (animal resembling a sheep but larger in size) may have been exposed to blind swans in a similar environment.
Rather, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Secondly, H-coronavirus-229 E is very different from the poliovirus and should not be a disease in poliovirus, whereas the alpha-coronavirus coating is responsible for the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha coronaviruses of algae have not been found in ruminant animals.
The possibility that alpins HCoV-299E associated with the alpha-coronavirus virus can be transmitted from humans cannot be avoided.
In fact, parasites are a direct cause of human viral diseases such as rabies, Ebola, Nagah virus and Aids.

While the alpha of the coronavirus parasite acts as a gene pool in the H-coronavirus-299E, alpins and fungi can act as a salt cell that is the central source of viruses to humans. Just as in the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-KOV serves as the best model for the transmission of half-species, from bats to monotypes and from monotypes to humans.
The origin of MERS-COV from bats is traced to the identification and reinforcement of the fossil record.

It is well adapted to the changing habitats from a central salt cell to a stable and natural salt cell storage.
MERS-COV causes a very rare disease caused by low DNA mutation in these animals.
Transmission of the virus to humans is accidental, humans end up with a dead MERS-COV cell, when transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of the monkeys in the transmission of MERS-COV, the role of penguins, if anything, was different from the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They can eventually become a dead cell for SARS-CoV-associated beta-CoV-associated viruses, similar to civites in SARS-CoV-like conditions.
There are a number of possibilities for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans that may need to be developed or discovered in future studies.
First, bats can carry a cell lineage for SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is very similar to SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Second, penguins may be the nucleus of a newly identified SARS-CoV-2-associated cell enlargement.

The search for the original SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of salt-cell animals, there are three main causes of viruses that are equally important for facilitating the crossing of organism boundaries.
Above all, the average rate of transition of RNA deposition is high.
Compared to individual RNA-derived viruses, the estimated Cove buildup rate is set as "average" to "average" with an average of 10-4 substitutions per year per site.
Covs have evidence-by reading Exoribon class (RNA strip compacting enzyme), removal of each result from the boundary is highly altered and weakening and dying or not working.
In particular, replicated nucleotides are known to inhibit the spread of the coronavirus by inhibiting the intrusion of foreign nucleotides and dependent RNA and RNA enzyme.
Remdesivir is one of the preferred SARS-CoV-2 antiviruses to be tested in laboratory units.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In addition, the average jump is often higher when the COVIDs do not fit well with the host cells.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 where the jump average is higher than SARS-CoV-2 where the jump average is obviously lower, it is recommended that the adaptation level be higher.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Theoretically, a different segment that causes genetic mutation to produce a vaccine and an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 is an inactivated segment.
Second, the large RNA genome in the coronavirus makes the cell more adaptable to the mutant genome for jump and reintegration, and more likely to evolve into a co-existing organism.
This is supported by the unique analogous reading interface and the way the protein works on coding in the end-to-end third stage of the genome.
Third, the covids continuously randomly change their host during RNA distribution by a special 'selection-replication-specific' mechanism.
In a cell that serves as a fusion circuit, the covalent RNA is often leaped out of its membrane when it is captured.
RNAs with very long parallels and subgenomic sequences may duplicate to form new covid.
Evidence of a phylogenetic nature of reintegration has been found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, such as animal coronaviruses such as SL-COV and COV-HKU9 bat.
Cell-viral aggregation in relation to spread.
Along with the three viral infections mentioned above, the presence of the virus in the cell membrane is another factor that affects their spread among organisms.
In this context, the Sars-Kov structure is taken as a model, which has also demonstrated evidence for positive selection through transition processes.
Given the comparative analysis of human and SARS-CoV-2 isolation, SARS-CoV-2 has been thought to experience rapid adaptation in different cells, particularly with jumps in the RBD of the S protein.
RBD  usually binds to the S-protein in the covid cell and is specifically selected by the cell's antigen response.
RBD is a protein found in 318 to 510 amino acids on the S1 subunit. It binds to human ACE2 as a catalyst for viral growth.
SARS-CoV-2 RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, seals, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the transmission of extinct viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been defined to be distinct from human and cytotoxic RBD and 4 of them were stable on receptor-dependent to interact with ACE2 receptor.
Sars-Covid cytokines have a bounce in K479N and S487T of RBD, which may increase the correlation of the interaction of the Spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
Alternatives to these two amino acids are critical to the suitability of viruses for humans.
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell membrane as SARS-CoV-2.
30% of the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are shared in the S1 unit of S protein where the co-representation of the S protein with human ACE2 has been altered.
Indeed, a study of EM found that the suitability of this binding was 10 to 20 times higher than that of the human ACE2 halfway point and the S ARS-KOVS protein.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Oddly enough, the NL63 coronavirus also mixes with ACE2 but with a different S component.
There are other H-virus receptors, such as the N-aminopepidase enzyme for H-virus 229E, and 9-O-silic acid for H-virus OC43.
They may be the cause of this successful transmission of CoVs in humans following this interspecies transmission from animals with the disease.
In spite of these cellular receptors, the results of transmission between coronaviruses are governed by independent and specific causes in other cells.
Protein diffusion is a cell-to-cell transfer between humans and the natural cell-to-cell locations of coronaviruses such as bats, snakes and mammals, which may pose a barrier to transmissions between the suns.

In this case, the important chemical defenses of the area where the virus is present and exposed are identified and described.
Extensive and neutral genetics of the independent and cell-restricted cause of SARS-CoV-2 using artistic CRISPR gene technology may be produced.

For example, the gain or loss of a protein-filled cell can be manipulated by large sample sizes.
Among the SARS-CoV-CoV-like proteins, ORF8 has been discontinued from mutation and is important for human entry, where SARS-CoV-related parasitic viruses have been isolated, but have been shown to convert to ORF8 protein.
The extinction characteristic of the 29-nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in isolated material at the beginning of the pandemic.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of interaction with alpha and gamma coronaviruses, which are a larger number of RNA-associated RNA polymers.
The locations of these settings were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and a portion of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV pandemic has been shown to have experienced the same regulation at different times, as it has in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2 the regulation was also observed in the coronavirus, which was regulated in the unbreakable genes of the coronavirus with other animals of the coronavirus.

While the intact ORF4 can be observed in bats and hawthorn viruses associated with H-CoV-229E, the covers of H-CoV-229E exhibit a complementary enucleotide, resulting in suppression.
The latest, the development of the coronavirus is controlled by its own cells by diagnosis.
The absence of symptoms, or the presence of mild and debilitating symptoms, was diagnosed when the bats were infected with the coronavirus, indicating transmission between the coronavirus and the measles.

They are increasingly used and are retained without any strong immune response.
The secret of why they are carried and have no symptoms is there, and what causes a severe infection in humans.
Symptoms are usually caused by a strong immune response and activity and high protein saturation, the stronger the immune system, the more severe the lung damage.
Conversely, the receptors for which the symptoms are detected, the immune system response, are separate from the increase and prevention of CoV.
The same anti-virus response strategy may have effective benefits for immunization against SARS-CoV-2.
The response rate of the protein to the virus is very strong in bats.
As such, the administration of cell-derived protein, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, should be beneficial.
However, the activity of NLRP3 multivariate protein, in bats, is incomplete.
Logically, the presence of NLRP3 multivariate protein with MCC950 may be beneficial for the treatment of coronavirus.

While beta-CoVs have 95% nucleotide association with SARS-CoV, the coronavirus bat-CoVs have 96% nucleotide association with SARS-CoV-2.
While cattle and other market animals have been found to contain the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic virus, immediate and rapid intermediate cell transcription for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.

As SARS-CoV infection arose from human-animal interactions in the markets, the closure of those markets and the killing of civilians effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For these reasons and logic, the Pangolin animal must be removed from the market, to prevent animal-related transmission, and this is due to the discovery of the basics and elements of the coronavirus beta-virus that was highly correlated with the SARS-CoV-2.
However, the likelihood and how SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to humans by pangolin and other mammals remains to be determined in future tests.

To stop the spread of the MERS, there must be a comprehensive effort to develop an effective formulation for the MERS-CoV vaccine, alongside infection control measures.
While we cannot avoid this virus, a new genetic variant may be the cause of its spread.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In particular, the coronavirus parasite containing animal stem is diverse.
There are many opportunities for the animal coronavirus to develop and regulate, resulting in the emergence of new coronavirus that are more likely to be transmitted and/or fatal to humans in the future.
The culture of wildlife eating should be banned in some parts of China to reduce the unwanted relationship between humans and animals.

In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural habitat, until there is a chance for them to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of the virus, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continued mammalian monitoring is essential for a better understanding of the environment of CoVs and their natural habitats, which is proving beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future spread.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent animals from transmitting the disease is to keep humans away from environments that are the natural habitat of animals that carry the virus.

Second, if bats play a more significant role in direct transmission to humans, how humans interact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal behaves as a primitive cell, how it interacts with different human species, bats and penguins, should be explained.
Finally, since many mammals infect domestic animals, they may be prepared for SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and testing of infection should be carried out.

Now our guidelines came with a comment by Zhou et al., who offered a simple suggestion for their scoring from their clinical experience.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We support and appreciate their important work.
However, their work needs to be updated with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (Test Seven) and new research.
Conform to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), to ensure that a suspected case must combine each of the epidemiologic characteristics with two clinical characteristics for a comprehensive analysis, or must contain three clinical characteristics if no clear epidemiological history is available:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Clinical signs: (1) up to and/or symptoms of respiratory syndrome; (2) with specific symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) due to white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts in the early stages.
Diagnostication of confirmed cases must be based on suspected cases where any disease or serological evidence is present as follows: (1) real-time PCR positive testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequence showing high provenance of the novel coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM specific antigen and IgG specific antigen for SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or a change in the IgG specific antigen for SARS-CoV-2 from positive to positive, or the intensity of IgG4 increases once in the recovery phase above that phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second volume (January 18, 2020) and third volume (January 22, 2020).
Diagnosis of disease in blood samples in volume four (27 January 2020) and volume five (8 February 2020) was added; and then serological evidence was added in volume seven.
These modifications were based on the continuous work of researchers to search for a rapidly detectable nucleic acid detection kit, with respiratory pathway samples that included blood samples, which increased the availability of differential samples, and supported the delivery of positive antibody results to specific assured parameters.

Therefore, the Zhou et al. diagram needs to be updated, because they counted people who had no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be further explored in clinical practice and research.
As a result, we hope that more direct evidence will be available and we ask readers to comment.
To mark "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we recommend that you follow and follow the latest guidelines for your country.
Our team will update our guidelines on how to provide assistance in a timely manner.

To balance the decline, Coles requested more packages from suppliers and increased delivery times, Wollers requested more supplies, while ALDI ordered its supplies for a planned early arrival on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase the volume of goods, but local council restrictions on delivery of trucks made the task more difficult.
He predicts higher production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and with less private.

According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said that Coles and Wolverine share the view[that] if there are too many on the shelves, if products like toilet cleaning and cleaning can be [bought] and quarantined, then you can reduce the fear.

Kimberly-Clark, who owns Kleenex Toilet Clinic and Sorbent's Solaris Paper, stressed that they worked 24/7 to protect supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some retailers offered free toilet clinics to the first suppliers of toilet supplements in Melbourne, when fewer supplements were made because sellers had more time to spare during the holiday weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily print newspaper in Darwin, included eight pages to be cut and used as toilet clinics.
Stores hesitated to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 that said they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman further stated that other products are in high demand, such as masks, cleaners, washing machines, liquid soaps and soap.

Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing spread of COVID-19 - a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - as a global pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how a disease has spread, rather than how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stresses that governments should take action:
Tedros Adhanom Gibrisos, Director-General of WHO, said that all countries could still change the course of the pandemic.
If countries sign their people, they punish, treat, isolate and follow them in response.
We are very concerned about the high prevalence and the high intensity and high levels of respiratory failure.
Dr. Tom Friedin, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the outbreak was "unexpected".
He said, in some published by CNN in February, "except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread".
Gibrisos cited similar comments, saying, "We have never seen a coronavirus pandemic before".
"And we've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time", he added.
The emergence of a new global pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the United States Foundation for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "In short, it's getting worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.

The outbreak was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.

The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
The complications of the condition may include pneumonia and symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome.
The incubation period for symptoms is usually five days, but may be anywhere from two to fourteen days.

Preliminary treatment for symptomatic and complementary treatment. The recommended procedure for pathological treatment includes hand washing, mouth covering while on cocaine, distance from others, and self-care and self-medication for people suspected of being infected.
Around the world, authorities have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantining, traffic restrictions, tracking risk controls, and institutional closures.
The pandemic has caused a global social-economic crisis, delayed or rejected sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread material shortages due to purchases.
Schools and universities are closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, serving approximately 99.4% of the world's student body.

Due to reduced travel and the closure of large industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a series of pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, and began an investigation in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the Havana seafood market and so there is a belief that the virus is of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus associated with the coronavirus parasite, the coronavirus penguin, SARS-CoV. The first known person to have had symptoms and then become ill was on 1 December 2019, the person seen was not associated with the Fresh Meat Market Association.
In cases with initial batches reported in December 2019, two-thirds were related to the fresh meat market.

As of 26 February, the proportion of cases reported among young people, aged 19 and under, was 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK science adviser Patrick Valance predicted that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before a mass-affected immunity was available.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and whose test results are confirmed to be positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and most countries had official policies to exclude those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 concluded that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected, and these unrecorded cases were the source of 79% of the reported cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March predicted that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the reproductive population (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a 5.7 rating.

For those who do not recover, the duration of the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, there have been approximately 97,000 deaths from COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75% had other health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may include people who have died being screened - for example, in elderly cells, etc.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that "we know that [the number of reported deaths] is low prediction", a statement with one-on-one report of no counting in the United States. This decrease often occurs during epidemics, such as the 2009 pre-N1H1 influenza pandemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As of February 28, outside of China, there have been more than a dozen deaths, each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported fatalities, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of screening, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender and public health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3 (for those with symptom onsets from January 1-10, 2020*) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onsets after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the CFR, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from the disease, and the IFR, which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
Statistics are not chronological and follow the specific population of the infection through treatment of the condition.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these figures for the private population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine predicts that the overall mortality rate from the disease to the epidemic will be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above-average forecast is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 screening in Germany, and a statistical study that analyses the impact of screening on CFR predictions.

"But you can't predict right now when that's going to happen".

17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London University of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to be eradicated within one or two years".
According to a study by Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College of Open Leadership, social distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus - because it's so contagious - will be completely gone" and "may be a seasonal disease, coming back every year".
The return is negative in terms of mass resistance and jump rate.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be proportionally unmanaged and infected persons may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are up to (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Other uncommon symptoms include stroke, breathing spasm, loss of sense of taste, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, coughing, wheezing, diarrhea, rash, blood clots, diarrhea, or skin bleeding. WHO reports that about one in six people suffer from severe illness and breathing problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies acute symptoms such as respiratory problems, pain or persistent pressure in the cornea, sudden fluidity, walking problems, and blue-green facial or lip; prompt medical attention is needed if these symptoms are present.

People who have been positively impacted for up to three days before symptoms begin suggest that the disease may develop before significant symptoms appear.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported with no symptoms, but no symptoms have been reported by several countries during the course of the follow-up studies.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is not clear how easily the disease spreads, it usually affects two to three people per person.

There is a belief that there is an animal race.
General analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the betacoronavirus gene, in the subgene sarbicovirus (line B) together with two strains derived from bats.
96% of the genetic level of other BatCov TaTG13 batch virus.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers concluded that there was only one amino acid difference in several parts of the genome between viruses in penguins and those in humans.

The virus can cause illness based on symptoms, although the ultimate confirmation is by reversing the rRT-PCR of the infected patient or CT radiation.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, with less specific tumors, with similar focusing characteristics to other pneumonia processes and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis".
The World Health Organization has published a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Testing uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breath or blood samples.

As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been approved for general use.
In the United States, serological testing has been developed by Cellex and approved for emergency use only by trusted laboratories.
The special focus features of radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include a disordered glare and a lack of side effects.
The Italian Radiological Society compiles an online database of the results of the radiation exposure of the confirmed cases.
Due to the presence of other diseases such as adenovirus, uncontrolled exposure by PCR is limited in the detection of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results to PCR and showed that while radiation is less indicative of infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it be considered a screening tool in epidemic areas.
The Luli neuron network built on artificial intelligence was developed to detect the specifications of radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding the loss of eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, cocaine or pigiene with clenches and direct dumping of the clench into the rubbish bin.

Social distancing (also known as social distancing) involves disease control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Roads include quarantine, travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, trackers, playgrounds, theatres or shopping malls.
Individuals may practice social distancing practices by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using non-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from each other.
Most governments are now mandating or promoting social distancing from areas affected by the outbreak.
The largest number of gatherings by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was reduced from 250 (if there is no known COVID-19 outbreak in the region) to 50, and then to 10.

Prevention requires much more scale, in order to reverse the spread of infection from person to person to less than one part of managing and dealing with the sudden spread of infection is to try to reduce the peak of the spread of infection by correcting the spread curve.
This reduces the risk of over-imposition on services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical practices that may control the spread include individual protection measures, such as hand sanitization, wearing masks, and self-isolation; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as school closures and denial of large gatherings; community participation in promoting the adoption and participation of such practices; and environmental measures such as cleaning of clothing.

South Korea has implemented mass screening and local quarantine, and has issued alerts for the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those affected who have self-quarantined and imposed severe penalties for those who do not comply.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and imposed sanctions on mass purchases of medical supplies. The same goes for Great Britain and the United States, which shows that mitigation (mitigating rather than stopping the spread of the epidemic) and catharsis (cutting off the epidemic growth) are major challenges.
Good policy reduction may reduce healthcare peak demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but it still causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.

For people who have a second week of screening, the sample can then be taken from the deepest airway via a medical machine or can be used via a leak.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Charity University in Berlin in January 2020 which used rRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and produced 250,000 medical devices for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The test looked for E-type agents that were spread from all coronavirus receptors, and RdRp specific to SARS-CoV-2. The BGI group was among the first companies to receive emergency equipment from the Department of Health Products, PCR based on SARS-CoV-2 research equipment, in the United States and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a new 2019 RT-PCR test for the virus to the public through the International Discovery Laboratories.
One of the genetic tests for the test material version caused the results to be unsatisfactory due to the use of false materials and test lenses at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being tested throughout February 2020.
Tests using two different elements were not credibly determined as of 28/2/2020. Until then it was announced that local and state laboratories were allowed to conduct the tests.

On 21/3/2020, SafeID also obtained EUA's approval from the FDA to conduct a 45-minute test.
FDA approved a test that used nucleic acid fusion technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of temperature changes, this method can produce a positive test result in just 5 minutes and a negative test result in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 such devices in the United Nations. and Abbott expects the number to increase to 50,000 tests per day. A test using antibody data and a single and a single N protein-coagulated patch of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid flu test.
"A literary review of March 2020 found that "X-rays of the cornea play a minor role in the early detection of the disease. While detected in CT (computed inflammatory imaging) it may occur even before the initial symptoms".
Norms on CT include a multi-grade glass binary machine, a geometric imaging machine, and a back-split and irregular machine.
Subpulsal dominance, insanity and stiffness are treated as developmental disorders.
A comparative scientific study of PCR to CT in the city of Wan at the origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with a distinctive moral image of pulmonary disease and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology announced that "CP should not be used to screen for the detection and detection of COVID-19". In March 2020, the CDC announced the approval of PCR for early detection.

These can be used to conduct research on people within 7 days of the onset of infection or following the onset of initial symptoms to determine the immune system and to diagnose disease in patients. Tests can be performed in a laboratory centre (CLT) or with a point of alert (PoCT) screening.
The high rate of automation of systems will be available in several medical laboratories for these tests but their availability depends on the average output for each system.
ClT is the most commonly used example of an external blood test, however a series of samples can be used to delay the clot response.
PoCT is a blood sample usually taken by skin piercing.
Contrary to PCR, no extraction step is required prior to the test. On 26/3/2020, the FDA released 29 authorized names that had provided the vaccine with the warnings as requested and are now available for distribution of their test antibodies.
As of 7/4/2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Medication Administration. In late March 2020, veterinary diagnostic and epitope medical laboratories received European approval for their laboratory equipment, which can test for IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
Testing is capable of performing six samples per hour and is therefore faster than normal PCR testing for RNA.
Antibodies are most often detected 14 days after the initial infection, and in early April the UK found no laboratory antibodies, so it purchased antibodies that were good for use.
Hong Kong has a plan whereby suspected patients can stay at home, emergency department giving patients a sample syringe, leaking it and returning it and then getting the results of the tests. The UK NHS has announced that they will test a plan to screen suspects at home, which will put others at risk of infection by the patient if they enter hospital or use an ambulance. While contributing to cases of COVID-19 suspects, a healthcare professional will take examples using appropriate precaution.
The delivery centres have helped South Korea, carrying out some of the fastest and most extensive tests in the country. In Germany, the International Union for the Regulation of Physical Health Insurance on 2/4 said it was able to perform 12,000 tests per day in a migrant workplace, and 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week.

Most countries have dealt with the pandemic with the separation of patients and travel restrictions, but without strict traffic restrictions such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with high mortality rates have lower mortality rates, which may be why these countries are better prepared to conduct research on people with very weak or no symptoms.
WHO states that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct testing and national laboratories with COVID-19 experience will send the first five positive and ten negative cases of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO laboratory sources to incorporate testing.
Of the 16 laboratory sources, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the lists, the column "Positive Check Rate" was developed by the country's Inspection Police.
A country that only tests those who are admitted to hospitals will have a higher rate of positive cases than a country that tests all of its population, whether they have symptoms or not, the rest is the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand sanitization, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dust, grease, microbes, and other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap to ensure "dangerous times"; prevents the spread of various diseases during the day, such as diarrhea, cholera that are transmitted by dirt.
People also suffer from respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common hemorrhoids, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes or mouth.
The five critical times of the day when soap is important; before and after baking, after cleaning the baby's underwear or changing the baby's breast, before giving a baby a meal, before eating and after cooking or preparing meat, fish, poultry.
If water and soap are unavailable, you can tie your hands to gray.
Before and after cooking.
Before and after care of a sick person.

Medical advice states that hand washing can reduce about three-quarters of the chain of diarrheal diseases, this is achieved by providing clean water to poor children.
48% reduction in the number of diarrheal diseases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent diarrhea and respiratory hypertension (ARI), as an automated procedure in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Acute insufficiency syndrome, a major component of ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diarrhea and diarrhea together cause the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children annually.
UNICEF, the practice of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet with a tight nap can save lives more than any other treatment, preventing deaths from diarrhea by 50% and preventing deaths from respiratory distress by 1 in 4.
Handwashing is often associated with other medical procedures such as water purification and sanitation.
Washing your hands will also protect you from the beauty of skin that is transmitted directly through physical contact.
A minor adverse effect of hand washing is that too much hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish scientific study found that washing hands completely can lead to rashes and skin conditions known as hand block or hand sprains, which are especially common amongst healthcare workers.
Many repetitive hand washing is seen as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five days when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of contamination; after bathing (meal and meat), after cleaning the baby's underwear (towel change), before meals and before and after cooking or cooking meat, fish and poultry.
Other instances where proper hand washing techniques must be applied to prevent disease transmission, including before and after wound treatment, after cleaning the hips or bones, after disposing of animal waste or handling animals, and after disposing of waste.
In many countries, there is a low proportion of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 hand washing study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of people wash their hands with soap at home. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest hand washing rate at 97%, and the United States has the median hand washing rate at 77%, and Sen has the lowest hand washing rate at just 23%.
Basic Health Care Program implemented in parts of Europe in the Philippines is a practical example of child health promotion and education.

Microbatic removal on the skin was developed by adding soap or taint to water.
The most important action of soap and soap to reduce the barrier to take is to increase the potency of the take-off.
Water alone is a compulsory skin cleanser due to fat and protein, which do not come directly from the dirty base.
The cleaning is facilitated by a flow of water.
Sofon solide, due to its recyclable nature, can hold bacteria that were previously sought after by users.
A small number of studies that have been working on the bacterial dissolving in cat's liquid-removal soaps have found that the dissolving adds antibacterial to the cluster.
CDC still says "soap fluid with hand control is safe for cleaning".
Antibacterial soaps are very expensive to obtain in public health care.
For the time being, there is no evidence that the use of antibacterial or predicted lethal microbial agents is indicated for the antibacterial resistance of organs in nature.

Infringement of the national belief however. Scientific experiments have shown that using hot water has no effect on the reproduction of microbes on the hands.
A hand wash liquid or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer without the use of water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol hand sanitizer without the use of water (also known as alcohol hand sanitizer, alcohol hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer) became available to the public.
Most depend on isopropyl alcohols or ethanol combined with microbial detergents such as carbohydrates (acrylic acid polymers) for a solution, or polymers such as glycerin for a liquid, or coughs that are easy to use or to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.

Alcohol hand sanitizer does not affect the transmitted viruses (or norovirus) of the virus types, which can cause infection with hepatitis C, and the necessary hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer must be used to fully cover or cover the hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and end of all fingers are cleaned for up to 30 seconds until the fluid, cap, or fluid is washed away.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed and worn through the hands. The United Nations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hands be washed with fluid before hand washing, especially when hands are clearly dirty.
The increase in these substances depends on their ease of use and the speed at which they kill microbes, however, they should not serve as a substitute for hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based detergents can cause dry skin unless skin creams or moisturizers are added to the action.
The effects of alcohol dehydration can be reduced or avoided by adding glycerin or other skin creams to the action.
In medical treatments, alcoholic hand sanitizers contain skin creams that are less effective than soap and antimicrobial agents that cause skin pain or dryness.
Sensitivity to handwashing, sedative discharge or excessive sensitivity to alcohol or other oral hygiene additives are rare.

The ability of alcoholic hand sanitizers to rely heavily on structures and designs, and has historically failed.
Recently, prescriptions that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and accumulated antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced effects after reuse, this may be due to a high skin irritant response.
Many people in developing countries cannot get soap and use dust or ash instead.
Dust or ash may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dust or ash is contaminated with microbes, it may increase the spread of the disease more than it decreases.

For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A review system of 70 scientific studies showed that social methods are more effective in promoting handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of the rise in school handwashing (three-star approach) by UNICEF encouraging schools to take samples, is a cheap step to ensure that students start using soap among other clean and sanitary demands.
When the minimum score is achieved, schools can be converted from one to three stars.
Construction of existing hand washing facilities can be part of the process of increasing hand washing that has been implemented to reduce infant mortality and morbidity.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a handwashing awareness campaign that seeks to change behavior, as a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has released a handwashing icon.
Some studies have determined the effects of handwashing in the backward countries of the banned DALY interaction.
However, a review suggests that adding soap to a handwash is more effective than water and other detergents.
The effects of handwashing on human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have children or injured soldiers in hospitals was first reported in the 19th century by two inventors of handwashing: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, inventor of the English nursing method.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were the cause of the dirty odor they called the smell of the spices.
In the 1980s, Foodborne Illness and Infectious Diseases awareness led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increasingly use hand washing as a critical way to stop transmission of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness of the importance of soap washing in many countries to protect individuals from chronic diseases.
For example, posters for "partial handwashing techniques" were placed next to hand washes in public toilets and in office toilets in buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "hand washing" means declaring a person to be responsible for the thing or taking responsibility for it.

Religions describe hand washing for both purity and symbolic purposes, as a symbol of hand washing, the use of water rather than soap to wash hands is part of the practice in many religions, such as the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, and the Tiwilah and Nethillat Yadimah religions in Judaism, and Lahabhu in Christianity, and the Lawahida in Islam, religions describe hand washing especially after performing the deeds.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam teach that people wash their hands after using the toilet.

Controls of workplace damage for COVID-19
Workplace Harm Controls for COVID-19 is a program to set out safety and health measures to control harm to prevent the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)
Effective workplace injury control depends on the workplace and job function, depending on the risk posed by the workplace resources, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), fewer occupational hazards are associated with fewer than average workers and fewer than average workers, so basic preventive measures have been announced, which include hand washing and encouraging workers to go home if they have a patient or breathing problem, and routine cleaning and anti-inflammatory work environment.
Central occupational risks include those who request to be denied contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected by social transport or international travel.
This includes workers with connections to the general public such as schools and high industrial working environments and some high aviation regulations.
Control of risks for these groups, as well as basic infection prevention measures, which include advanced air filter and skin protector air conditioning and the availability of special protective equipment if someone has COVID-19.
OSHA classifies healthcare and mortuary workers as being at risk of COVID-19 in high-risk conditions, and the risk is much higher if the worker uses air conditioning or collects samples of suspected or COVID-19 infections.
Control of the damages for workers working in the control engineering department such as negative pressure air exchange rooms and individual protective equipment suitable for the job.
The spread of COVID-19 can have a variety of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to the risk of illness and the need to care for others or the fear of contracting the disease.
Business partners may change the desires for the goods they request and the reasons for requesting them (such as when people come to market or when they deliver or sell the goods).
Recently, cargo vessels in geographic areas affected by COVID-19 may be stopped. Preparation for infectious disease and face-to-face planning can be used to carry out protective actions.
Planes publish risk levels related to the workplace and workplace functions, including sources of infection and adjustments to increased risk factors in the home and community and individual risk factors such as old age or chronic disease conditions.
They also shorten the necessary controls to address the risks and contingency plans for situations that may increase the outbreak.
Preparations for infectious diseases and plans may be subject to national and subnational regulations.
The objectives of the disease response include reducing the spread within the team, protecting those at high risk of health complications, and reducing the number of staff on other appointments in their support chain.
The severity of the disease is reflected in the response of the society where the burden is being taken.
Increased Damage Control is an idea used in the protection and safety function for the harm control group by the activity.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Controls include workers' avoidance of harm regardless of worker behavior and can be the most effective solution to implementation.
Controls are changes in the workload or steps that require action by workers.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than in engineering control and management, but may help to prevent infection.
All types of PPE must be determined based on worker damage, appropriate allowance as applicable (e.g. breathing problems), accurate warning, legal allowance, durable, tracked, as appropriate, removable, cleaned, stored or prepared to avoid contamination.
According to the United Nations Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupational exposure has the least impact on the public and corporate workers.
Basic methods of infection prevention recommended that all workplaces should wash their hands frequently and encourage workers to stay home if they are sick and have breathing problems including coughing and wheezing, provide blankets and dust, prepare for remote communication or shifting if necessary, alert workers to the use of each other's tools and equipment and prolong cleaning routines and anti-inflammatory work environment.
Incentivize identification and avoidance of persons with disabilities is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The United Nations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of illness stay home as long as they recover from the wheel, wheel symptoms and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking any medication to reduce or other medication, and as the disease conditions recover, allow workers to stay home to care for sick family members, and workers who are concerned about the measures.
OSHA defines occupational hazards as those who have close or close contact with people who are not carriers or suspected COVID-19, but may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to social transmission or because the individual is traveling internationally to a COVID-19 infected location.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Workers in these dangerous groups are rarely asked to use respirators.
If a person is unwell at an airport, appropriate controls are made to protect workers and passengers that include separating the patient from others by a length of 6 feet and assigning one of the groups to care for the patient, providing a face mask to the patient, or requiring a mouthguard to clink the patient when he or she is knocking or flushing.
The group of workers must wear a protective medical vest when dealing with a sick passenger or handing out body fluid or dirty tracts and add personal protective equipment if the patient was up to or had persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Plastic bags must be prepared for the wearer and the dirt must be cleaned and filtered.For cargo markets, including shopping malls and cruise ships, damage controls such as delayed travel when sick or single-person quarantine and direct notification of the ship's medical center if someone has any illnesses or other symptoms on board.

When there is little effort to reduce social transportation, social distancing measures can be implemented such as banning travel, meetings and other large gatherings such as medical education or religious gatherings or mass dining in a cafeteria, increasing the interval between tables and organizing trips and school holidays and restricting unnecessary travel and using medical office space for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant spread in the local community, despite the availability of social distancing measures, extended school holidays may be considered.For the governing body's rules for enforcing mandatory routine daily activities, direct health risks are underestimated by the CDC.

If there is close contact during the hazardous load, workers must clean and sterilize their vehicle belts and seals for reuse, using household cleaning equipment, and using standard cleaning practices.
OSHA assures healthcare and death ward workers that they are at high risk.
High-risk workplaces, such as healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transfers of workers known or suspected of COVID-19.

Air vapour exchange machine for patient care and room stimulation machine and air vapour testing machine and some dental and test or sample drying machines.
High risk of working in the death chambers workers who are preparing for bodies that were infected with COVID-19 at the time of their death; those workers are at high risk if they perform surgery, additional engineering controls for these risk groups will place quarantine rooms for patients infected or suspected of COVID-19, when respiratory switches are used.
Negative respiratory pressure equipment may be appropriate in some health care settings and in the dead.
Examples must be operated with a Level 3 screening machine.

WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses, and medical face protectors and gloves for those who collect samples of respiratory problems from COVID-19 patient care and transportation without air-conditioning.
If a respiratory exchange is used, the surgical mask is changed to N95 or FFP2.
Given that separate PPE aids have been approved, WHO recommends that PPE requirements be reduced for information transmission, medical barriers such as medical windows, only those with direct contact with care be allowed into the care room of COVID-19 patients, only the use of PPE aids for special purposes, continued use of the same respiratory equipment without removal while monitoring patients by means of diagnosis, monitoring and regulation of PPE support chains, and recommending the use of masks for those without symptoms.

We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response will depend on our solidarity, cooperation and social formation which will be the most important part of this strategy.

Directions for our work and our schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our itinerary for the next few days and months.
In this conversation, we considered that our ideas would be a critical response to what we are facing and would be the best way to continue our approach at this time.
Long term, we wanted to keep the pressure off and support our mission for the long term.
If you need a reduction, that's fine.
For the entire team, the promoters, the workers' promos:

If you want to work, we'll support you.
️Most people use work as a way to avoid global pressures.
What an incredible reward we can give, especially in a time like this.
Once again, it's about taking care of yourself.
Our request is that you speak to your manager, so we know what to expect and what we can arrange accordingly.
Some works are considered to be original.
There are some things we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety, Fundraising (among others) teams do crucial work that may need support.
We are embarking on a process with all departments to align our current objectives and focus on contributing to what is fundamental to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, we just focus on the basics.
Slow down now won't hurt you later.
We don't plan on "trying twice" once the pandemic is over.
We will not do more to obtain a license which is now a bad and inappropriate practice.
We accept that the situation has changed, and we work to define new goals and timelines.
What happens to APP?
To adjust our new schedule and daily work hours, we intend to adjust the timetable for delivering our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose a renewed 2019-2020 plan that will allow us more time to raise funds to allow workers to do critical work and care for themselves and their loved ones while helping those in need to reduce their work schedules for the next several weeks.

Angiotensin-containing enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is stained on the outer surface of cells (cellular membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 prevents the activity of the associated angiotensin-containing enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of secondary angiotensin and increasing its (Ang1-7) potential as a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also serves as a gateway to entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually expressed as hACE2.
The zinc duodenal angiotensin enzyme contains metallic zinc which is expressed on the inner surface of the tubules and other cells.
ACE2 protein is composed of the N-region protein peptide M2 transporter and the C transporter that binds to the dominant amino acid transporter.
ACE is a single type I protein, with its enzyme active on the surface of the receptor cells of the lungs as well as other tissues.
The main cell membrane of ACE2 is separated from the main protein which is a P enzyme called shedes, and becomes a polar protein in the blood vessels and is significantly separated and absorbed into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is bound to the cell membrane, specifically the lymphocytes of the cyclin type 2, the small intestine, the blood vessels and blood vessels, and the soft tissue cells of the blood vessels in most organs.
ACE2 is also a term for the presence of mRNAs in the frontal lobe of the brain, and in the center of the brain, and in the deep brain, and in the brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to balance the ACE sequence.
ACE reduces the hormone aniotensin one to angiotensin two in the bloodstream.
ACE2 injectes carboxyl-thermial amino acid phenylalanine from anigotensin II (Asp-Arg-Bal-Tyr-IIe-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses from the vasodilator angiotensin (1 - 7, H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Lle-His-Pro-OH) during the fermentation process.
ACE2 can also block a number of other peptide bonds such as -[des-Arg9] bradykinin, apelin neurotensin, dynorp hin A, ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the overload of the natural amino acid SLC6A19 and has also been found in Hartnap disease.
As a carrier protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, such as HcoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (this virus causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (this virus causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the co-transcription of the S1 binding of the SARS-CoV-2 protein into the ACE2 enzyme on the cell surface results in the conversion of the major inhibitor and tracer of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosome within the cell.

However, some professional associations and bodybuilders recommend continuous ACE reduction and ARB treatment.
The revised form and development analysis published on March 11, 2020 found that "the use of implanted ACE has been improved with a 34% importance in reducing the risk of adverse events with control".
"Moreover", the risk of severe lung disease was lower than that of patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had an increased risk of lung disease, especially those with congestive heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with the manipulation of pneumonia associated with acne, although the results were less healthy than the overall risk of pneumonia.
Human epithelial cell ACE2 (rhACE2) has been shown to be a novel treatment for severe lung injury, and has been shown to be resistant to pulmonary embolism and low oxygen in small intestine with lipopyoacyriide- effective in treating severe symptoms of hyperventilation.
ErhACe has a half-life of about 10 hours in humans, with a single action of 30 seconds plus an effective 24-hour life.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a safe drug for those with previously established antibody angiotensin protein (RAS inhibitor) or for use in the treatment of acute pulmonary fibrosis.
BCOVID-19 Apps are mobile apps designed to assist in tracking people in contact with the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, for example, identifying people (contacts) who may have been infected.
A large number of programs have been developed and implemented, with official government support in some jurisdictions and jurisdictions.
Some of the basics of the work have been developed to build programmatic connectivity.
Special concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems based on the geographic location of program users.

Some countries use the Internet based on site monitoring instead of software, removing both requires downloading a software, and the ability to not leave monitoring.
In Israel, controlled internet was accepted.
The Internet is based on the solution to raw location data access and has a problem with the accuracy of privacy encryption.
Although, not all systems and server centers need to be able to access personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been created that only server centers use to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-program-based system was used to conduct communications monitoring.
Rather than using a specific software, the system collected surveillance data from a variety of sources such as mobile device surveillance data and dealt card data, and combined these to view a note in written letters to hidden victims.
In addition to using this information to alert for hidden contacts, the government has also made its data locations public, with some things being allowed due to the remotely accessible changes in privacy laws following the MERS breach in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have set up which use both data centers and privacy systems.
It's April 6, 2020, and details have yet to be released.
Monitoring privacy is a good idea to set up, with a large body of literature research dating back to at least 2013. That on April 7, 2020, more than a panel of experts will be working to address privacy concerns, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Bluetooth Low Energy.
Although, PEPP-PT is a regulatory opportunity that includes both the collection and interaction hubs, and does not have a single protocol. Interactive protocols include privacy monitoring in close proximity (DP-PPT/D-3t), temporary contact numbers (TCN), random contact numbers (fka, CEN), protocols and operating methods for mobile phone connection monitoring (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifying personal data is never extracted from the device, all synchronization takes place on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing a "security pathway", a platform for using privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location data or pathways to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
The Roog Walking Program: Protecting Personal Privacy from ...... was released in March 2020. Another similar case is the Safeway platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops proprietary technologies originally developed by MIT's Data Lab.
Security Location takes advantage of secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive and health location data with other users and regulators, without compromising the privacy of that data.


On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, released a campaign for connected monitoring, which they believed would protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and preserving cryptography.
They also published the specifications and details of the core technologies used in the systems.

2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that causes a variety of severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease.
Common symptoms include cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhea, dry throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The incubation period for early symptoms is usually around five days but may vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases are mild symptoms, some are triggered by a thoracic and bipartisan infection.
As of 17/4/2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is particularly prevalent among people during close contact, often due to tiny breathing droplets caused by coughing, sneezing, and talking.
While these tiny droplets are formed during breathing, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces and are otherwise affected from a great distance.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The virus can remain on surfaces for more than 72 hours.
The highest transmission rate is during the first three days after initial symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear or in the later stages of the disease. The standard way to diagnose the disease due to the correct timing of reversed inhibitory polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in a pelvic and peritoneal opening.

Currently, there are no specific COVID-19 vaccines or treatments.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the six WHO regions.
People with the virus may have no symptoms or have symptoms of influenza such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms of a sudden emergency include difficulty breathing, persistent sore throat or pressure, dizziness, difficulty waking, and blue facial or lip flushing: direct medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Symptoms of respiratory symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been noted in statistics.
Some cases of sinusitis initially only occur in severe sinusitis and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may develop into a hemorrhage, damage to two organs, and death.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
5 to 6 days may vary to 2 to 14 days.
So within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people have progressed their symptoms.
The role of the symptomless virus in transmission is not yet fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests that it may be the cause of the spread of the disease.

The International Commission on Mental Health has launched a report on symptomless cases that includes daily cases of 1/4: 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were symptomless at the time of diagnosis.
Both leuka and bile can carry large viral load
Speaking aloud causes more small droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cockroaches can cause small droplets of whale to be carried to depths of 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, international academic science has suggested that biofluor transport may be unsuitable or that airborne pathogens in the passage of public rooms may produce positive RNA samples for the virus.
Certain medical procedures such as airway insertion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory arrest to become airborne and thus airborne.
While there is speculation that it may be spread by the face, this fear has been used. The virus is most pronounced when people have symptoms; whereas the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the fear is less.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is not generally clear how quickly the disease spreads, it can infect two to three people.
In particular, the virus is a detectable virus that can be observed for one day on cardboard, for more than three days on plastic (soft polymer) and clean polymer, and for more than four hours on 99% copper.
Whatever the case, heavy loads depend on humidity and temperature.
Sapone and detergent are effective if used improperly, soap products break down the fat-resistant levels of viruses, force them to break down, and release them onto the skin and other surfaces.
Other treatments, such as chemical detergent and anti-viral detergent (anti-inflammatory agents) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of leaks were taken from a chart of two days after the start of the hospital stay.
Five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, and the sixth patient had the highest viral load on day two.

The lungs are the most susceptible to infection from COVID-19 because the virus enters the cell membrane due to the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common type of alveolar lung cell type 2.
Virus uses a special surface of viral sugar called a "peplomer" to bind to ACE2 and how it is inside a cell.
Heart failure was found in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The rates of symptoms of coronary artery disease are high, resulting in systemic abnormalities and immune system disorders, but heart muscle failure may be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High incidence of macular hemorrhage (31%) and hematococcal thrombosis (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a low chance of recovery. Analyses of people who have died due to COVID-19 have found that the spread of alveolar and inflammatory lymph nodes in the breast.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a preference for ACE2 epithelial cells to express respiratory distress, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of coronary artery disease.
In particular, GM-CSF hospital-specific T cells have been shown to link the IL-6-secreting single-nuclear infection inhibitor to acute pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic cell authors are also reported in the study.
WHO has published several screening protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction of anti-imposition polymer chains during manufacture (rRT-PCR).
Testing was normally performed on breathing samples obtained from the analgesic analgesic of a pelvic cavity and a dry eye; however, analgesic analgesic or analgesic analgesic of a bladder may be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results will be immediately valid.
Scientists who could isolate a genus of the coronavirus and spread its genetic sequence can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection.
As of 4/4/2020, anti-inflammatory tests (which may detect active infections and if someone has been infected in the past) were in development, but no snowflake is ever used.
Senior experience with fractionation has shown that it is accurate to only 60% to 70%.
FDA approved the first checkpoint inspection in the United Nations on 21/3/2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan suggested methods for identifying infections based on medical practices and epidemic risk.

Control of breathing, radiation imaging (lung disease with altered alveolar saturation) and constipation may appear as progression of the disease.
Little is known about the deterioration of the sensitivity and fitness of COVID-19.
The most common hospital findings in the UK are:
Pneumonia: pneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver, constipation and pneumonia.

Mild lymphatic discharge: gastric discharge, pulmonary discharge, abnormal large lymphatic discharge, medial lymphatic inflammation and intravenous large cell structure.
Strong aqueous humor: extensive alveolar damage (DAD) with extensive ejectable aviaries.
DAD causes acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and low blood oxygen.
Syringe dissolving: the secretion of the alveolar vessels and the medial ventricles.
Blood: DIC: Red carbohydrate deficiency response.
Metoda-inhibitor-reducing infection risk: stay home, avoid young places, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, practice proper breathing and avoid losing your eyes and nose with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends wearing a nose pad when you're coughing or sneezing, and recommends using a napkin if a napkin isn't available.

CDC has recommended the use of a piece of leaf to cover the face in public places, to restrict movement by people without symptoms. The goal of social distancing planning is to reduce contact between people with disabilities with large groups by blocking schools and workplaces, stopping travel and denying large public gatherings.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
No medical treatment has been found to be effective in halting COVID-19. As a result, it is not expected until early 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "viral testing".
CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are clean, before eating and after urinating, cocaine or pyjamas.
Recommends further use of a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when water and soap are unavailable. For areas where hand sanitizers are unavailable, WHO offers two rules for domestic production.
In these rules, the antibacterial activity of ethanol or isopropanol is increased.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores from alcohol; this is "not an active anti-inflammatory agent".
Glycerin was added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, support for other infected organs with the virus.
CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
Excess oxygenation membrane (ECMO) has been used to identify shortness of breath problems, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Personal hygiene and healthy living and food safety are predicted to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the International Commission on Mental Health have published medical recommendations for the care of people hospitalized due to COVID-19.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol above ibuprofen for the first line of use.
Consortions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings where the implementation of actions can create aerosols, such as air conditioning or hand air conditioning.
For healthcare professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the infected person in an air-conditioned isolation room (AIIR) as well as using standard alarm, contact separator and air-conditioned alarm.
Recommended items: PPE seats, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical supplies. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are approved.
N95 air conditioners are infused into industrial areas but the FDA has allowed masks to be used under the supervision of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but their effects against a specific biological agent are not guaranteed for uncontrolled use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face masks, or homemade masks, as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not as severe as they need air conditioners or switches, but a proportion do.
Type of respiratory aid for COVID-19 people associated with shortness of breath is being studied extensively for people in hospitals, with some evidence that using a respiratory tube can be avoided by a pneumatic tube or positive air pressure.
The likelihood that each of these drugs has the same benefits for people with terminal illnesses is unknown.
Some doctors recommend using a quick air conditioner if available, as this method limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the lungs.
Many of the developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds for each patient that limits the ability of the health system to control the sudden increase in the number of severely ill people with the coronavirus that will require hospitalization.
A scientific experiment in the brain found that 5% were admitted to the controlled areas, 2.3% needed air conditioning support, and 1.4% died.
In Sindh, about 30% of people in hospitals are eventually admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19.
Air conditioning systems are becoming more complex due to the improvement in symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARDS) from COVID-19 and the difficulty of oxygenation at high levels.
Air conditioners have the ability to control pressure and high PEEP are required to increase oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of air conditioning associated with air pollution entering the lungs.
High PEEP may not be available in the air circulation of older adults.
Research into advanced treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the medical laboratory.
Antiviral drugs seem to be the most effective.
Although new treatments may take until 2021 to be developed, many of the prescribed treatments are approved for other uses or in advanced testing.
Antiviral therapy may be tried in humans in severe illnesses.
WHO has recommended voluntary admission to safety and efficacy therapy trials. FDA has granted temporary permission for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in immediate and immediate danger.

Previous work on SAES-CoV has been positive because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 extract to enter human cells.
Three string sequences have been released.
1.The aim of the studies is to create a vaccine for each virus.
The use of viruses that are either compulsive or deadly, for the purpose of speeding up the human immune response to a novel COVID-19 infection.
Strategy 2: Secondary pathogens for the purpose of creating a pathogen that makes the immune system sensitive to specific parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme outlet.
The third strategy, is to nucleate the nucleus of the nucleus (DNA or RNA nucleus, a new method of cotton production).
Experimentation of the fractures in each of these strategies requires testing for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a fracture began on four Seattle volunteers.
