The TV's not working.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
What's it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this stuff.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
