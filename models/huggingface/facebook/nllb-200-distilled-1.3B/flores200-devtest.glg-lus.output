lus. waggonways (wagons on rails pulled by horses) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
lus. Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads on the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
lusers were introduced very early to secure the rails in position. however, gradually it became apparent that the rails would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
lus. This became a common practice, but iron caused a stronger wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
lus. Eventually, wooden wheels replaced iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
