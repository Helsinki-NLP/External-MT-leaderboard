This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also communicates details that fossils could not provide  such as color and three-dimensional imagery.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown above with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed rod called a rachis, but have other feather features - teeth and gills - the researchers concluded that the rachis probably evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or beauty, and the researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not the plumage of a crocodile.
The researchers speculated that although it was a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen showed adult feathers, not the plumage of a baby.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning outside the police station of Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is relative to changes in the magnetic field.

In France, voting has traditionally been non-technological: voters go to the booth one by one and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with their candidate on it into an envelope.
After the official has certified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and places his signature on the voter list.
French electoral law is quite rigorous in its codification of procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote, and no envelopes are added except those thrown by duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following certain procedures.

He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adecco was brought before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony can be denied because her photo has been published frequently.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path by distributing photos and other data of suspicious individuals".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, told reporters it would not provide any further comment, at least until charges are filed.
This document, according to the leak, will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects likely to be covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The hunters in auxiliary pest control had to be carefully controlled by rangers, as hunting was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the UNPS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NSPD's Parks and Heritage Conservation, the four shooters selected for the first shoot-out have been properly trained and trained.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (TVR).
This is the fifth Martelli Interim Council election in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TVC as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure of elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
About 60 incidents of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METP) said it was aware of 27 emergencies related to these devices.
Last week, METP announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "slightly minor".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "a big embarrassment".
The quake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. on Friday in Greenwich).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six are reported to have been killed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took over the elderly lady's place because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and took a job at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the injection of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators seized two onboard memos (black boxes).
Fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Moon died two months into the night. She's pretty unique, like herself. She's a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels commented: "The moon was as fresh as I was...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
From 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
If you look at the categorical responses to the poll, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three Commonwealth Games relay events, but due to his complaints, doubts arose about his physical fitness.
He could not take painkillers, which were forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest prime number known.
Some people confirmed the discovery with various gadgets and software before the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have provided water as well as organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have long since collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political baloney and nonsense".
It's rumored that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide detailed information to pilots.
No additional transport is being launched and no ground trains will stop at Wembley, and car parking and interchange parking will not be available on the surface.
Fears over the lack of transportation made the game closed without a team of fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer due to the reproduction of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospys fortress, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospys connorotis.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or twisted into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (false) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions  are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by turning them in a dish and then, with your clean, wet hands, dip them into the bullet.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer balls, creating an unusual sensation and forming something like a shell.
A toilet connected to a complex sewage network was in almost every home in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were in mixed company.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and what we see.
You need a solid rocket at least 100 feet high to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below is a larger number of medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey  from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (especially free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt for numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche - a special position that each cat occupies and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called pride.
The prawn includes one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to 30 females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion-eaters behave much like wolf packs or dogs - animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are just as dangerous to their prey.
A tiger, as a well-developed athlete, can push upward (though not very skillfully), swim, jump great distances, and beat five times as hard as a human.
Tigers are the only cats that can roar, and they are in the same group (the Panther family) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the multicolored roar of a lion, but rather a confused sound.
They like to eat small animals, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that an ocelot preys on are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that the survivor tracks and tracks the animals he preys on, by scent, looking for their scent on the ground.
Their night vision is very good in the dark, and they are also very quiet in their movements, hunting for prey by hiding in the environment and then suddenly leaping out to find their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are other resources and other competitors, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger competitor than it was before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all - they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, or the creation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which we breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which we expel (i.e., exhale).
Plants make food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The Mosasaurus was a high-class predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything other than other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth along with an additional set of teeth on the front of his thigh, meaning that no one who got in his way would be able to escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Thyrax could not compete with it.
The Romans ate mostly what we know, but they also had their own strange and unusual feasting feasts, including wild boar, partridge, slugs, and a rodent called a wolf.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate from chairs, the wealthy men enjoyed communal banquets, where they rested on their sides during meals.
The ancient Romans could not include foods that were brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which was open only to priests.
Sometimes special towers were built in the shape of pyramids, which were part of temples and were called zikurates.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of this Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were open counters that faced the street; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, travelling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
And even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence was written on the backside, "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", at the bottom of the document, and inverted at the bottom.
Information about its author is not known, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was kept in a folded state.
So it's likely that the record was added simply as a tag.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by the French Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, and this landing was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the "France Combattante" liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture of a large group of people who live and work together, i.e. societies.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civil", which refers to the Latin word "civis", which means "citizen", and "civitas", which means "city" or "city-state", and this also defines the size of society in some way.
The city-states can be seen as the precursors of nations, and civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a steady cultural footprint, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence, so they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time  Congress was its sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because of the lack of a national executive or judicial power, it relied on state bodies, which often did not cooperate in the implementation of all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to overturn interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before their amendment, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing are popular.
Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipel" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailed past and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a branch in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the aboriginal grain-producing practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonosek, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: the Intihwana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the analogue era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratios have adopted the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm is actually a bit of a bump in the pan, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APIs family of formats) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The often-used and derided rule of thirds  is a simple guide that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to him, the most efficient place to place the main object is the place of intersection of the lines that divide the raster into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should fight against suffering and poverty, and that's what the church's money is for.
The central body of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church really held that position.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, and although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries, it did cut off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain mined minerals in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, creating a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism dominated the mood of most citizens and nations.
Recognizing the horror and cruelty of World War I, nations sought to prevent such a thing from happening in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America in order to apply for a job at Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development was each ruling family that became a prominent dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable age of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most notable of which was the Sango Period, which lasted 60 years between the Qing and Han dynasties.
During this time, there were fierce battles between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne at the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is owned by the people, not by a single individual ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of rank based on class, they're now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
The Prophet was deeply interested in matters beyond the confines of this worldly life, and he frequently visited the cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Nur, for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not very easy to find, even if you know it exists, and once you get to the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "up" button looks like the letter "V", and the "down" button looks like a bracket or square without the bottom side.
Up means you start with the head and push the knob, and down means you start with the pads (where your hand holds the knob) and pull the knob.
The upward movement of the hammer usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the hammer is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to add your own marks with your pencil, but note that printed marks for the knitting tools have a certain meaning, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the marketplace drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The Yurba forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved to the frightened queen with the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The military expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial US regime to pay a significant portion of the expenses and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism  is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or the technological imperative to the idea that human destiny is strictly dictated by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development as such follows a path that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that is more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might argue that the machine necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unviable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, leading to new healthcare methods for treating bodily injury.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and they, in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is famous for being the epicenter of luxury, dating back to about 400 C.E., and lasting until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its situation deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing of the people of the East was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time was the use of knots to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Non-commodity farming  farming which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses harvested seeds of native plants of a given ecoregion combined with seed exchange and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in organic farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel disregarded by societal standards and allow them to acquire a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion items, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, misery, or willful cruelty, and were not socialized as adults.
These children, called "jungle children", or savages, are often held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents leave the children at their mercy because of their unacceptability of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
It may be that the wild children were subjected to cruel treatment or suffered serious injuries before they were abandoned or fled.
Some were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves in much the same way (within physical limits) as the corresponding pollinators, for example, treating humans with fear or indifference.
And while design technology is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help given to individuals who are learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is acting out the narrative, like the little human-violin in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to question, point out, and explain procedures that can be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up in an environment that is devoid of care, attention, and upbringing, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides for safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Adoption should provide all the things they lacked in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Egmy and McCord (1998), when they investigated audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, they claim that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microbial expressions.
Oliver Sachs, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be present in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genotypic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reserves with each generation.
For primates with digestive systems like ours, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs at the expense of the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and beans, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless we cook them.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only well digested but also provides a considerable amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all of this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors were tackling the protein question in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption  is the process of purposefully waking during a normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself rearranging the clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, causing you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is the exact opposite of the level of tension in his body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of enlightenment, and the only thing that can prevent us from achieving that goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by Mahayana love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened from yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, through which the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and forms the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years had passed since the war ended, and the former allies had become enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years, and there would be real battles between armies of nations on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian platform.
However, these plans lost relevance almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines primarily, tried to stop the movement.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy production of milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills and other pastures, and were tended by goats, often children or teenagers, better known as shepherds.
The cobblestone road was built in England in the 16th century.
And while the goose roads were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that worked on them to develop higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more bumpy conventional roads of the time.
The spokes were introduced to keep the rails in place early on, but it gradually became clear that rails would be more effective if iron fasteners were fitted on top.
This became common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron, and the first fully iron racks were introduced in 1767.
The first known movement was walking, and people started walking straight two million years ago, with Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright, as they normally did.
Bipedalism is found in fossil Australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelian Anthropocene may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's just a symptomatic treatment, but if we're not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically as a result of human progress in science and technology, and the problems have become greater because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, the manuscript was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Brodside.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters are the oldest known surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive, and they are called ponies.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot to learn from dinosaurs.
Their paws have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like the Tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In a binary number system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open vial of a medication or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
Formal entomologists refer to this group of insects as beetles.
This term reflects a centuries-old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both cones and bed bugs are nesting insects adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or that it is not in the best interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents are stripped of parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to learn by scientific methods how the world works, and that method really drives most scientific research.
Although it is not merely experimentation, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; questioning and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their functioning through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic factors, are recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks  are self-sustaining oscillators that will prolong the cycle period, running freely even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, or the proteins of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material, and whether the cells are attached to the germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells are passed on to the children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and exploring ecosystem information.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, and learning new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to get to their workplaces, followed by other people who work in the places they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation, back and forth, everyone is somehow connected and maintains a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Now science notes that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone lives in a society and uses transportation systems, and not everyone complains about them.
You don't often hear these kinds of complaints in developed countries about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and failures every day?
Road flow  is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because the behavior of a driver cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave quite consistently; thus, traffic flows mostly have some logical sequence, and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and maintenance of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This opens up a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterflies and the one-dayers.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed his claim, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems rational, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it contains eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20% of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main course is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the structures of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in native form, and they're fairly easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they evolve into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is mostly a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that will include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, since its introduction, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the status and use of the pencil was diminished.
People now write messages on a computer screen without ever having to go near a wrench.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when they invent something new.
The principle of the atomic bomb is that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy weight upwards, and the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break up with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The upper layer of the moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the high mountains.
On the near side, there might be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava would be easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that were inherited by them during the process of adulthood.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not make them do certain things.
Two popular contextual theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues: on the one hand, they try to stay "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable personality who feels that he has to change everything that the team has done and do it his own way.
Ultimately, the leader is solely responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet within time zones, which may be incomprehensible to their local managers.
The presence of a real "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual collective.
The Invisible Team is a governing body to which all members report, and the Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of implementing an organization's learning, which takes so much time?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result of the process of working together, an organization can overcome barriers and create a new innovation process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive ability, and thus narrows the search field and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their studies support the relationship between pathology in the brain and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation.
In the course of AI research, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been embedded in several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual outdoor classes, where students can look at museum artifacts or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Virtual tours are also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as an album.
Blogging can also help improve a student's writing skills.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, audience presence usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers are starting to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "stimulates students to be more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging  is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material from the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital, is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and modernity.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauty of Muskogee and its outskirts.
All of these things and more are highlighting in Ontario what outsiders consider to be the quintessential Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildlife.
A population comparison that may surprise many: The United States has more African-Americans than Canada has its own citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and it's a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around Europe's Cape of Good Hope to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All traveling women are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a heel (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what you might consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for you to be followed, held by the hand, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt and named it Casa Branca, but in 1755 after the earthquake abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-i-Badia, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajinis, pottery, leather goods, calyan and a whole host of other small items, but these are all for tourists.
Goma  a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava of Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is fairly safe, it is important to study the situation with the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before any travel outside of it.
It is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest mountain gorilla sightseeing tours in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi).
Because of this, and because of its relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it has an airport and a tourist attraction with its history.
In 1990 it was included in the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS coverage of Henry Louis Gates' Miracles of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which hosts different representatives of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major landmarks and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and entrance.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which entitles him to access some South African parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place of special interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's architectural face has been compared to the glittering histogram, which is reflected by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side of the harbor, towards Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in the sandy terrain along the northern shore.
This is a place that was appropriated by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forests, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The forest is part of the Indian territory called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps, for they include some of the last islands of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is thought that 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted reindeer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since buses are often crowded, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Route taxis  are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oiapoque Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the banks of the Oiapoque River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guinea.
The bridge has a main span of 83 metres and a length of 378 metres.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-cat hunters, sometimes engaged in natural agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Paiagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Spanish conquerors clashed with indigenous groups to create Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at other times of the year.
Check out the Argentine Polo Association for news on tournaments and ticket sales for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set at the equivalent of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although they may take British or United States currencies; check with holders in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes you feel colder than the thermometer would indicate.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to park management instructions, stay at least 100 yards per meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter away from all other wildlife!
As humble as they may seem, bison, great deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep proper distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so take along and do not cook with scent and keep the camp clean.
Apia  is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour became the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the Tupu supreme leader Tamasese Lealoufi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two harbors.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Virtually all of them are sandy beaches that are safe to swim on, and most of them are shaded by poplar trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitematā Bay, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helens in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with lots of shops along the coast.
The main local beer, "Number One" is simple but pleasant and refreshing.
You can taste a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines can withstand transportation better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "fleet white" is unfamiliar to Australians. Short blak  is "espresso", cappuccino is made with bitter herbs (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate is of Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are not cheap, but they are delicious.
Many trips to the reef take place year-round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay particular attention to the warning signs of danger.
The Cubed Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April 1770 north of the equator, and they can sometimes be seen during other months.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay once he arrives at his destination.
Tour agents often work with specific hotels, although you can try to book with them some other accommodation, such as a campsite.
Touring agents usually offer packages of services that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements, or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agency, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a large majority of music event attendees choose to stay overnight, and for most attendees this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be in the action, you'll have to come early to take a seat closer to the stage.
Remember, even if the music on the main stages has stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping spots for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin layout, because traveling through the ice makes a pretty terrible sound if you're very close to the source.
The cruise of St. Petersburg involves spending time in the city.
Casinos generally go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests, and windows and clocks are usually lacking, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and in the room.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness negatively affects judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is minimal, and you are not allowed to drive on bare asphalt.
During a storm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by water or ice forming on the windows of cars.
On the other hand, freezing and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and it attracts many visitors.
The term safari in general usage refers to a trip overland to admire the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are prone to approaching cars, so standard equipment will allow for a good look at them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are fragile creatures, and they are best observed through binoculars.
A safari (also called a "busk walk", "hike safari", or "walk" trip) is a hike of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some tournaments taking place at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the delay was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation schedules vary, but as of late March most of the coronavirus cancellation schedules have not been extended to July 2020  the time the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most of the tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
In many hotels, a washer and dryer can be rented even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have any, or you don't like wearing polished socks, then you can try using a hair fan, if there is one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause a seizure, or in extreme cases propane).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water takes a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, so if you have a problem, consider buying water from a reputable bottler.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals they have not heard of in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping  is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who travel to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through isolated deaf forest.
If you are unfamiliar with country roads, consider that they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths, and steep turns.
The published speed limits are markedly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, though, the cellular connectivity here is much better than many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German baking is quite good, and Bavaria's is quite rich and varied, similar to the baking of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is quite common: apples are used in baking all year round, and cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, fondue, and other tree-growing nuts. Popular cakes will often be especially tasty with a pot of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try what is called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen", or "Krapfen", depending on the region.
Curry  is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to the kari; in Southern India and occasionally in other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
But, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
The strings are the supports for the rider's saddle, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous because of the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If a rider drops his horse and his leg gets caught in the stream, the horse may run and pull it.
First, most riders wear riding boots with fittings and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English, have a safety feature that prevents the saddle-belts from falling if the falling rider pulls them back.
The Colinachamo Valley, with its variety of granite high elevations and crests, is a major rock climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America.
The climbs include the enjoyment of breathtaking scenery from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes through the endless potential of the walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding  a popular sport that involves riding a snow-covered slope on skis or snowboards that attach to your legs.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities, with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski trekkers", planning their entire holiday around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of the ski is very old  cave paintings dating back to 5000 B.C.E. depict skiers!
Skiing as a sport was started as early as the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first health ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called ski backpacking, ski tourism, or skiing.
This is related to, but usually does not include, alpine-style skiing or alpinism, the latter being done on steep slopes and requiring the use of tougher skis and shoes.
Think of the ski route as a tourist route.
If the conditions are right, you can travel significantly more than you can on foot  but it's really rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-maintained routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through multiple visa procedures and passport controls.
But in this sense, the Schengen area operates as one country.
If you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without re-entering passport checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to get a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies classify goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies depending on geographical location  the age limit in North America, for example, may be less than in Europe.
Craft goods can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Forestry  is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many who have other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale deer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, etc., keeping deer usually as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern commerce, and tourism is a significant source of income in Sápmi, where the Sámi live.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among the non-Gypsy community, it is considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of these people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to government travel advice, this may affect your travel medical insurance and non-travel insurance.
You may also want to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
The newsletters provide only brief information on the political situation in the country.
The data presented are often superficial, generalized and very simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather  is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social upheavals, or death of people.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of bad weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, thunderstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are urged to learn about the risks of adverse weather conditions in their area, which can affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An Internet search for the "Environmental Enemy" course will likely give you the address of a local company.
Usually, all the issues discussed are covered in much more detail during the course, usually with hands-on instruction.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid training, and sometimes fire training.
Books and magazines about desert survival are common, but there is little publicity about combat zones.
Tourists planning sex-change surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to consider such documents is also very varied.
Searching at checkpoints also became more serious in the post-September 11, 2001, era.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reverse currents are the reverse currents from waves that break up on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and there rapid currents can form into deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue in trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, the backflow will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to go where you will not fall back into the current, or, depending on your skill and whether you are noticed, it may be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have had no trouble adjusting to a new culture may find it particularly difficult to adjust to their native culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and have lost certain habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect patience and understanding as needed by travelers on their return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
You usually hear the sounds of tourists and traders all the time.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
The pyramids display scenes, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and claims to which are claimed by several countries, have the largest bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano lies at the base of an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land  is a territory in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into a plateau, and then rise again, forming the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Pass, separated by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Ridge is home to the highest mountains in Antarctica: the Vinson Massif and Vinson Peak, which reaches 4,892 m (14,932 ft).
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be out in the open with clear satellite visibility to make a phone call.
The service is often used on ships, including cruise ships and expeditions, which require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about how to connect to this service.
Travel and study are becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning their academic holidays.
This practice is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during an academic holiday can actually improve your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Usually, such educational programs are paid for.
Finland  is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat to visit the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, considering that one in seven people visit a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands it is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises are characterized by a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can spend a few full days in a historic place, returning for the night on a ship.
When you go to the mainland only on boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced traumatic experiences.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not different from the personal fears or disgust for other things that so many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane operates and what happens while it is in flight can help them overcome fear based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly, and time is often critical when it comes to delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but in the case of other routes and small firms have faced a problem.
If they were to send things by air, it would take several days for some routes to unload and clear customs.
The only way to do that quickly was to send it as checked baggage, which is not allowed by airline regulations without a passenger, and that's your exit.
To fly first or business class, you obviously have to put a lot of money on it (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can usually expect to pay four times the standard fare for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally, on direct flights from point A to point B, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum amount for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee for this.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau.
Moldova  a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.

The village is worth a half-hour's walk.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which has become widely known to foreigners after the complete adulation of Lord Byron's review of its grandeur.
The Scotturb 403 bus can be used regularly to reach Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Brothers of the Temple), the site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.

Please treat this place with the dignity, the solemnity and the respect it deserves.
Do not pollute the site by placing markings or graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer to converse in Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, and unplanned failures are automatically reported in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Overall, this is no more than a false stereotype, but still the best way to experience Paris is to behave as a "bien élevé" (well-behaved) person as possible.
The Parisian severity will soon disappear if you show a little ordinary respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, pine and fir, and contains a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptional diversity of crops due to different microclimates and soil types, as well as variable altitudes.
The area is also home to an incredibly wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, reindeer, wild cat, and deer, as well as many other known species, can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries give robes to women who come unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow them from the store at the entrance, but the clothes won't be washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing them.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa-Amb-Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available fillings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie in the sense you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It's an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Perhaps it also makes reading easier, though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced as they are spelled.
The main letters to pay attention to are s and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the subsequent vowels.

However, people who have some knowledge of Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to it and does not need to be studied separately.
Today, ancient observatories are generally obsolete and function as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes for scientific research are large objects in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum flower was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first flower festival was held at the Imperial Palace by the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to destroy even "a single" specimen.
If you visit an official garden, collecting "samples" will also result in expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy to navigate place where you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and scorching sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron, not just to the nearest Jewish settlement, Kiriath-Arba.
Indoor waterways can be a great idea for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a sightseeing cruise on the Danube, or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians worldwide.
It's a tradition to spend Easter night without sleep in some open place to watch the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold a Saturday night Easter service during Easter weekend, and the faithful often begin the celebration at midnight to mark Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first came to the islands came here either by water or by air.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
After man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals appeared, including goats, horses, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will discover the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark throughout the day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you too can enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners are accustomed.
The standard work uniform is a suit, and employees address each other by their surname or title.
The emphasis is on harmony in the workplace, with the group's efforts being valued above personal achievements.
Employees often need to get the approval of the manager for any decisions, and they are expected to follow the instructions of the manager without question.
