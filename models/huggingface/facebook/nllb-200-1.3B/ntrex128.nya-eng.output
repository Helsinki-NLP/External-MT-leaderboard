Members of Parliament are concerned about 'looking like a fool'
There is confusion among some Members of Parliament with the view that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has been because of the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament from various political parties are concerned that this could lead to scandal.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that it "sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means primitive and pwp means garbage.
One member of Parliament for the Plaid party said the whole party was "not happy" and would come up with other solutions.
One Welsh Conservative said his party was "open to other ideas" on the name change, but noted that it was an acronym from MWP to Muppet.
In this case the Welsh w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the symbol u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to establish the name, said: "The final decision in selecting the Members of Parliament is something to be considered by those members".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public poll in which it found that the public was in favour of changing the name of the building to the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission favoured the title Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP proposal received a strong public vote.
The AMs seem to be making some decisions, but the struggle to reach agreement may be a major challenge for the Chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to issue an unconfirmed order on the change within a few weeks.
The amended bill also includes other changes to the way parliament works, including rules on dismissal of Members of Parliament and the composition of the committee.
The final vote on the name of the building will be taken by the House of Representatives after the bill is debated.
Macedonians go to the polls to change the country's name
People will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
Popular vote was instituted to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its ownership of the region and has repeatedly refused to support its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the name change, said he would not vote.
However, proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is a cost of joining the EU and NATO
St. Martin's Bells Silent Because of Harlem's Churches in Trouble
"In terms of history, the elders I spoke to said there were bars and churches everywhere", said Mr. Adams.
"Now, there is no such thing".
He also said that the lack of bars is understandable.
"People have different ways of communicating" today, he said.
"Clubs are not dining rooms where people go frequently".
As for the churches, they are concerned that the sales tax will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and they will soon return to their original position".
He also suggested that churches could be replaced by tall buildings with squares filled with people who could not support the remaining nearby shrines.
"Most of the people who will buy the apartments in these buildings are white", he said, "and this will hasten the day when these churches will be closed down altogether because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these buildings will be members of these churches".
Both were built by the white congregation before Harlem became a black city - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first English Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
The black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the house.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike by merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but when Mr. Johnson's supporters planned to rebuild the building, they installed several bells.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Mr. Johnson's next pastor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells installed "the bells of the poor".
The scholar who sounded the bells in July called it something of a "cultural treasure" and "an unalterable historical weapon".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that these are the first bells in the world to be rung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the main bell stand at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not take their place.
The developments at St. Martin's in recent months have been a difficult subject for architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
A so-called regular churchgoers' group - the parish governing body, made up of lay clergy - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "needs a regular churchgoer's group to pay for the expenses", even though the regular churchgoers were not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent to do the work.
Some of these regular churchgoers complain that the diocese does not do its business openly.
A shark injured a 13-year-old swimmer in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while swimming in California on the first day of the swimming competition, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was doing a swimming exercise with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then climbed with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought I was just catching crabs, but then "he realized that he was screaming, 'I've been bitten!
I have been bitten!'
His shoulder was all torn, "Hammel said he noticed as soon as he got to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'The water is full of sharks!'" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed in the intensive care unit.
The species of shark that injured him was unknown.
Marine Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was confirmed to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the ground.
Authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami of Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and develop local safety measures.
Giles estimates that there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most do not appear to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to open a jewellery store in the UK market
Sainbury's will compete with other retailers such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams who have stores with spacious sections and shelves that are staffed by other specialist agents.
As part of a major move towards the UK's $2.8bn jewellery market, which continues to grow amid a downturn in the clothing and home goods market, a beautiful boutique with doors has been tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out to other stores next year if it proves successful.
The idea of entering the jewelry business came about because supermarkets were looking for ways to use shelves that were used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its jewelry offering to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have a large number of stores with the same logo as the Boots brand.
This supermarket is also launching a cosmetics store so that many products are more compatible with vegetarians - something young consumers are keenly seeking.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will try to sell in two Sainbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, this week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to everyday snacks in local stores means that retailers have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainbury's, said the mall will look like a strip mall as the multi-brand supermarket tries to compete with the lower-priced Aldi and the more food-oriented Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also launched several residential locations since it bought two branches two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made the stores more profitable.
Recent attempts by the store to reorganize its jewelry and pharmacy departments have failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over whether they would distribute the proceeds from the pharmacies to its large supermarkets.
The new approach came after Sainsbury sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for $125 million, three years ago.
Lloyd should also be involved, adding several skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the chain's four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing manager at Sainbury, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beautiful doors to beautify the shopping area.
We have also spent a lot of money on our well-trained friends who will be there to give advice.
Our product lines are designed to fit every need and beautiful locations and easy access mean that we are now a fascinating place that challenges the old-fashioned shopping style".
Peter Jones was 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's departure from an $11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been left 'angry' by the departure of TV presenter Holly Willoughby from a £11million deal for her high-quality advertising brand to manage her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time to manage their Truly home-made clothing and other items.
The duo's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business model.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning took to Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon Den talent Peter Jones in anger over leaving a lucrative advertising business deal at the last minute - to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones "was upset when the TV star admitted at a tough meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth £1.5 million - meant that she did not have time to run their Truly home-grown clothing and accessories business.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business model and was promoted to earn Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
By the time Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that he was quitting Truly, Jones had boarded a plane and left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
Source: Truly was a key part of Holly's priorities.
This was his long-term future that would keep him employed for decades to come.
His outward expression left everyone involved in shock.
No one would believe what was happening on Tuesday, just as it was about to begin.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most trusted artists, could cost the business millions of dollars in costs due to the excessive spending on such items as cushions and candles and household clothing, and the potential for a delayed start-up.
And it can mean the end of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp started Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We can't say anything about his business".
A bitter argument 'then we fell in love'
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the media for making comments that some would consider "leadless" and assertive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a commitment?
Trump spoke in the voice of his "news readers" who were critical.
"I gave nothing . . ".
He also said that Kim wants to attend the second summit after their first summit in Singapore in June, which Trump said was a major step toward denuclearization in North Korea.
But talks on nuclear arms control have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean ambassador general Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "corresponding action" from the U.S. in terms of North Korea's earlier arms embargo.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose strict penalties.
Trump had high hopes for what he said at the summit.
"We are doing well with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
We are now very close".
He also noted that their efforts to maintain good relations with Kim have produced good results - stopping rocket tests, leading to the release of prisoners and the return of U.S. troops.
And he justified his strange way of talking about friendship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into the stadium, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy and Kill Many on an Indonesian Island
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, no national disaster was reported, which necessitated international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have clearly not sought help from abroad, so it is a bit of a hassle", said Sister Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to move to Palu, it is unclear whether these foreign workers will be allowed to work.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for disaster relief, said that Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to provide relief.
Despite the many earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is not well prepared for the natural fury.
Although tsunami houses have been built in Aceh, these are unusual on other beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although warning had been given earlier, must have contributed to the loss of life.
During the rainy season, traveling between many of the islands in Indonesia is very difficult.
Natural disasters make transportation very difficult.
A medical vehicle stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has promoted the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure as a key part of the election campaign, and has invested heavily in roads and railways
But the economic crisis has hit Mr Joko's government hard as he is due to stand for re-election next year.
Joko is also experiencing problems from religious violence in Indonesia, where many Muslims have embraced the monotheistic approach.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced as Christian and Muslim guerrillas fight in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other deadly weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player scored a match-play goal in the penultimate minute of Chelsea.
The player saved Liverpool from the threat of defeat by Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge, who was 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri as his team remained 1-0 down.
He passed the ball to the left and then pulled a bomb whose ball hit the side away from Sturridge.
The ball rose up into the air and headed for the top corner of the wheel net.
The ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who had thrown himself, and entered the net.
"It was just trying to be in the spot and get the ball and players like Shaqiri pass the ball forward a lot, so I tried to get myself as much space as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I hit the ball once and then pulled the bomb without thinking twice".
Chelsea lead 1-0 at the end of the first half after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through the Belgian striker Edin Hazard.
The Chelsea forward passed the ball to Kovacic with his heel in the middle of the field and then turned and ran into the Liverpool area.
Kovacic passed the ball to a friend who returned it to him in the middle of the field.
He then delivered a good ball that tracked Hazard into the goal box at Liverpool.
Hazard was faster than the Liverpool goalkeepers and with his left foot he hit the ball which passed Alisson Becker and hit the goal on the side away from Hazard.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the European Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the second UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said earlier on Sunday.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and caused waves to rise to 20 feet, the organization's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
Palu, a city of over 380,000 people, was covered with rubble.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of killing a woman with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged local residents who saw or heard anything to come.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its infancy but I would ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can take anything from the dashcam to speak to us because they may have words that are relevant to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed to the woman whose body was found that she came from Birkenhead and was found inside the house.
This evening friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was this morning.
The investigation is ongoing while the police are busy informing the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his home but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
She was at a loss for words when she realized what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He went on to say that 'it is very bad'.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were inside the courtyard and one outside.
Several officers had stood inside the courtyard to observe the sections of the house.
Anyone who has knowledge of what happened is asked to send a message on DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers privately on 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument to be struck by 'an attempt to rewrite history
His ban will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of much of England's moral and religious fabric by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's ideas as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate over the removal of icons that the subject of Oliver Cromwell's shadow outside Westminster Palace would not be discussed.
The depiction of the English civil wars is neither suggested nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrongdoer Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his grandfather Thomas had done a century earlier.
The beautiful Cromwell statue of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century thought and a part of the history of a man who many believe is still worthy of admiration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary champion against foreign pressure, in his case of the king.
Whether this is a complete demonstration is a matter of debate.
What is certain is that the turmoil of the mid-17th century has changed the course of our country, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents one side of the lands.
What he did as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance".
A Chinese farmer was bitten and killed by a pig
A farmer was bitten and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, known by his family name "Yuan", was found dead of a broken artery, covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and he found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the pig house there was a large pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crooked", said the street walker, nicknamed "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was being kept locked up to prevent any further bites, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating to pay for his death.
Although rare, reports of pigs harming humans exist.
In 2016, a pig injured a mother and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig crushed a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened the pig.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive but blood taste may be a "causative factor".
"It's just a game.
They are like children, eager to know ... they do not want to hurt you.
You have to give it the proper respect", he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwestern US
As predicted, Rosa is weakening as it travels over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is bringing floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the days ahead.
Rosa had a wind speed of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, beginning at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a mild-wind zone is being developed in the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as the storm begins to push moisture over the northeastern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the moist heat associated with the cold winds can bring heavy rains to the southwest in the coming days.
In the region, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches [1.4 to 1.2 inches] can cause flooding, garbage leakage, and desertification.
The high humidity causes rainfall of two to three inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of two to four inches is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Floods can be caused by the deterioration of the climate caused by tropical rainfall.
It can be dangerous to travel in a desert because of the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn small rivers into large rivers with heavy water, and thunderstorms can bring winds and dust.
The approaching cold winds will bring heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
More than a quarter of an inch of rain may fall, causing small debris and slippery roads
This will be the first rainfall in the region during their rainy season.
Tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday weekend and early Monday, before spreading late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
October can be hot across the US as the Arctic begins to freeze, but in the tropics it will still be warm.
This sometimes results in temperature changes over short distances.
There is a fine example of temperature variation in various parts of the US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the global temperature is again trying to rise.
Most of the Central and Eastern regions of the US are expected to see an October start with an 80-degree spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can get up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the city's usual temperature.
Our long-term forecast shows the possibility of a more severe heat wave in the eastern U.S. after the first quarter of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testify Thursday and Christine Blasey Ford accuse him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political battle rages on, with the media immediately interrupting a regular last-minute episode on Friday: a story prepared by Arizona Senator Fl Flake for the FBI's week-long investigation into the cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had caught him drunk and trying to undress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a kind testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It seems that more than 20.4 million people as Nielsen reported Friday saw this happen.
The company was calculating the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Some ratings were not immediately available on other networks that aired the show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble getting the numbers of people watching in offices.
To put it simply, it is the size of an audience comparable to that at a football game or a Graduation Ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which has its own television anchor who is heavily in favor of Kavanaughled's nomination, topped the rest of the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day of the broadcast, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The curiosity about the ending of the story remained high.
Flake was a key player in what happened on Friday.
After the Republican central office announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being yelled at by opponents as he tried to board a transport to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He had stood face down for a few minutes in embarrassment, on CNN television.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think they are telling the world the truth?
"You are strong, but most women are not", she was told.
Flake said the office issued a notice and said, before the carrier closed, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
The Internet and all television stations broadcast the story simultaneously for the next few hours, as the Judiciary Committee had to vote to approve Kavanaugh's Senate-wide nomination for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so if he understood the full extent of the FBI's investigation into the alleged case next week, which a few Democrats were pushing.
Flake agreed to it partially through a discussion with his colleague, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was strong, for it was clear that Republicans would not have votes in favor of Kavanaugh without a poll.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the Kavanaugh case.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her leaving the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview near the front page, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to dispute his plan known as the UK's Future in Brexit, saying that the idea of Britain and the EU receiving each other's money "was absurd".
Wayde Sims shot dead: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murdering an LSU player
Police arrest a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on a second charge of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video about the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on those glasses, according to WAFB reports it has a partnership with CBS.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail amounts to $350,000, said the Prosecutor.
The Coroner's Office in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police escape team, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to his arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "hard work and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-6-foot-tall player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you always complain about", Wade said.
A volcano releases ash in Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano ash has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Management Agency warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after it erupted again in the valley and recorded 183 volcanic ash and gases for 24 hours.
The board was responsible for the murmuring and shaking that took place in the area.
Video footage shows a thin layer of ash covering the windows of cars in areas of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Astronomers have seen an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southeast of Mexico City since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the right to vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following a confrontation between riot police and activists, and when thousands of people joined the riot to celebrate the anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote.
A group of masked protesters banned by riot police threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dark and dusty clouds in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
Violence erupted again in the afternoon as police used their batons to quell the fighting.
For hours the independence movements chanting "Don't forget, no forgiveness" met with the union's opponents shouting, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained in the riot, local media reported.
Security threats remain in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan independence movement.
Voters have largely opted for independence, although those who oppose secession are mostly absent and do not go to the polls.
According to Catalan authorities about 1000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the polling station in the province and triggered riots.
Independence groups camped out and stayed overnight on Friday to prevent the protesters from using violence in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participates in the isolation protests with his wife, said he no longer believes that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year was a great year.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but here we are back again", he said.
Despite achieving a modest victory in last December's local elections, Catalan independence parties have been struggling to get into office this year with their most prominent leaders in solitary confinement or in prison awaiting trial for allowing the election and declaring their independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in cooperation with police on her phone, said the clash was politically motivated on all sides.
"It gets very dangerous", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate in European elections is one of the best ways to strengthen the work against the anti-democratic and repressive elements that we have seen taking place in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after hitting houses with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was repeatedly hit in a Londonderry home.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building.
The bow can also be thrown into a vehicle at another time.
Menga's goal won the Rangers 1-0 against Livingstone.
Dolly Menga's first goal made Livingstone's team the winner.
Livingston's reinforced team stunned the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard to lose a second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal tied Gary Holt's team against the Irish in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain the Premier League champions this season, and next Sunday they face Hearts with the most points, trailing by eight points.
Prior to the game, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is increasing its league win total to six, and head coach Holt has not been defeated since he took over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's team misses a chance against the visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead before the goal, and their control of the ball is causing problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson got the opportunity but failed to score ahead of goal, then Alan Lithgow just tried his hand at running to meet Craig Halket's head ball near goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could trouble the visitors with the filices.
This was how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers made a mistake and kicked a field goal and the Livingston team took advantage of it, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson passed the ball and found Menga, who touched the ball from the middle of the box and scored.
At the same time, the Rangers were the best defenders but they found that the goalkeepers of the home team were not easy to get in and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos showed manhood by blocking Kelly's ball.
Scott Pittman's ball was caught by the feet of Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow failed to score on the Livingstone team's fielder.
The cross-country balls always entered Livingston's box and were removed continuously, while two penalty requests were denied - after Halkett's mistakes against substitute Glenn Middleton, and another mistake regarding the ball's grip.
'Amazing' from Livingston's team - according to one observer
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Good play and amazing results for Livingston's team.
For me, they have played very well, more than we might expect from this continuing victory.
He has not changed his style of play and his players have since won more than any other team, but the greatest honour goes to Holt for the way he has helped the team since his arrival.
He had many talented players.
Team captain Halkett was a big help in the game, encouraging his well-trained defenders, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Rangers were not encouraged, however.
It fell short of the fine standards it had at times held under Gerrard.
Their last game was not good - they only got a chance to try to score against the home team - and it is a surprise for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the league standings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and a smile of joy on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany - which is aimed at improving relations between NATO members.
They debated issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to officially open a new main mosque.
The city is home to a large number of Turkish expatriates.
The police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers came close to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-part presentation reflects the divided opinion of the public regarding this foreigner whom some German Turks regard as a hero and a tyrant enemy of others.
Deptford traffic accident: Cyclist killed after being hit by a car
A cyclist has died after a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The drivers stopped and emergency medical personnel tried to give medical attention, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after the death of a cyclist in a crash on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
The City Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus disruptions are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six officers have been injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" experts have been brought in to deal with the chaos, which involves eight prisoners and is taking place in one area.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Spokesman said: "Well-trained prison staff have been dispatched to deal with the situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those who are responsible for this will be sent to the police and may spend a long time in prison".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison warden had received medical treatment after being seized by a prisoner.
And in October last year the gangsters were called to the prison to deal with a major riot when their staff were beaten with clubs.
Rosa Threatens to Destroy Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Flood (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It is unlikely that the hurricane will hit Arizona, but it is expected to do so early next week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Western Desert, presenting a threat of flooding.
The International Meteorological Organization will monitor the flood risk on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix on Tuesday, and to approach again on Monday late due to rain.
The Phoenix International Weather Bureau tweeted that "only ten hurricanes have sustained hurricanes or tropical cyclones within Phoenix of 200 miles since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that made 40 miles across the AZ border".
The latest images from the National Hurricane Monitor show rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with rainfall in various places as high as 6 inches at the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Some areas of the Western Desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin may be 1 to 2 inches, with the chance of rainfall in various areas of up to 4 inches.
For those not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing since the area is subject to drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, some rain can be beneficial as the Southwest faces a drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-largest area, according to "weather.com.
First, the course of Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides in the Baja California region of Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing the cold waters of the Pacific and is thus losing its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to fall in Mexico in the midst of a rainstorm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be heavy, posing a risk of flooding there.
"Three to six inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 10 inches", weather.com reported.
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a hurricane before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, which will follow it across Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause severe flooding and the movement of waste into deserts and landslides.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was "well".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have asked anyone with video recordings of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'experienced, brutality, anger' of the Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote against the brutal and dangerous actions of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had faced, the brutality, the anger of the Democratic Party throughout his election.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had raped him decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified to his claims.
On Saturday the president said that "the American people saw the talent and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most successful lawyers of our time, a judge with a great record of public service", he told a group of his followers in West Virginia.
The president made reference to Kavanaugh's election as he spoke of the need for a positive outcome for Republican Party supporters in the midterm elections.
Five weeks remain before one of the most important decisions of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm running fast", he said.
"This is why I am everywhere fighting for the right to be elected".
Trump said Democrats are committed to "anti-prohibition".
The first significant step in the process of voting on Senators for the Kavanaugh election is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the toll rising
More than 384 people were killed, many of them swept ashore by waves, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu Juma as waves as high as 6 meters (18 feet) broke the beach in the evening and swept many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat began yesterday, people were still working on the land and not rushing, and they were affected", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, said at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulls cars, piles, houses, and carries everything out", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many houses and shops damaged, bridges broken and damaged and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Several earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) also said that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, and that has increased the frequency of tsunamis, it said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "massive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were unaccounted for.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be more severe along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is very close to the epicenter.
Communications "were completely disrupted and there was little information about the situation" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there", said the Red Cross, adding that staff and volunteers are traveling to the affected areas.
"It's already a problem, but it can grow", it said.
On Saturday the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves came when the warning was issued.
In an unconfirmed video shared on social media a man can be heard on the roof of a building shouting to warn people on the street below that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes a wall of water fell on the beach, sweeping away houses and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video at the time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages that disrupted communications and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military planes have begun sending supplies and relief from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but survivors still need food and other essentials.
The city's airport had been opened to promote emergency services only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the rescue centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It is very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city, where staff are living in wooden bags set up in the courtyard of their office, they have reached the damaged areas on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He told me that he had seen many ruined houses", she said.
It is very bad.
Although relief groups began to prepare to provide aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being denied access to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, donations and foreign workers are not allowed to move unless a national disaster is declared.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, it's a national disaster,' we can call for foreign assistance but no such information has been provided at this time".
The second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing were hoping that their loved ones would return as miracles unprecedented in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was carried from the toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team in parachuting, had trained two of the missing athletes in the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those detained at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As an adult athlete flying a parachute, I have my own concerns", he said.
Mr. Gendon also described how, a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread amongst the crowd of parachutists, he tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu players, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, though, triggered only one white mark, instead of two blue marks.
I think it means that the messages did not come", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a car stop at a Newport restaurant and tourist attraction
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, Friday morning, a total of $26,750 was stolen during a drive-by cash machine at a Newport restaurant and tourist attraction.
The drivers leave the cash in the slot machine at the club and plan to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in his report.
While the drivers were busy, a man ran past the employee in Brink and stole the bag of money the drivers were supposed to leave for another location.
Eyewitness reports said that they saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police could not say how many.
Anyone with information about these individuals should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changed his name to Ye
Singer Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show who quit "due to a disagreement", said the show's producer.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his occupational name, West said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are dead.
It comes from Kanye, meaning alone, to Ye alone - a mere reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, all of it.
This record is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the most famous musicians to change names.
Sean Combs is best known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers romantic names like Love and Brother Love.
Former West associate JAY-Z also announced that his name could be pronounced there with or without a hyphen.
Mexican military vows never to use force against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the massacre of thousands of students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress Mexicans".
Military gunmen opened fire on students at a peaceful protest at the stadium on October 2, 1968, killing some 300 people at a time when school-based liberation groups were established in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexican youths by providing monthly scholarships and opening several free public universities.
He also noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into the gangs.
U.S. government raises money for robotics
As China advances in robotics, the United States should increase its research expenditures in this area, says businessman and robotics advocate Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This has prompted many U.S. government agencies to announce the use of the technology, while the country lacks an effective AI program.
Meanwhile, China launched the initiative last year: and aims to be No. 1 in the world in terms of technology adoption by 2030.
"Raising research funding would be a good start, given that all countries are far behind the U.S., and we need to find more advanced jobs in this technology", said Lee.
The additional funding could double the chances of AI-related breakthroughs happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, with a booklet "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a major investor in China's robotics research firm, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop the robot that beat the great Othello and later became Microsoft's chief research officer and Google's China executive.
Lee expressed appreciation for the launch of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and wanted to know when the competition would be held again to help identify the next best robotics engineers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government awards, Lee said.
"It's not China that is recruiting educated people; it's the industry", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other companies have been recruiting experts from universities to work in the field of AI in recent years.
Lee said that the reform of immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think that people with PhDs in computer science should be granted citizenship.
China launched its Automation Development Program in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds the academies as much as the foundation and other government agencies do research in the United States, but Chinese education is limited, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include industry and academic stakeholders, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently spends over $100 million a year on AI research.
While the National Security Commission invests $100 million in the development of Human-Computing Robots each year.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name
The vote was held on Sunday to decide whether the country should change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that could lead to a long-running dispute with Greece over its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents its ownership of the region and has therefore refused to register Macedonia as a member of NATO and the EU.
In June the governments agreed to a name change for Macedonia, but cultural activists have rejected the idea, saying that the change would be an affront to the culture and history of the great nation of the People's Republic of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the elections and that the lack of voting by the majority of the population has raised the risk that the voting will not reach the half-county mark.
The poll question was: "Do you want us to join NATO and the EU in accordance with our alliance with Greece?.
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a difficult but necessary step to get the country admitted to the EU and NATO, and to leave the former Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote to decide the future of our country, the future of the young Macedonians to live freely as members of the European Union because this means that we all live free from fear", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although unconstitutional, many lawmakers have said they will vote on the results of the vote to make a strong case.
The name change would need to be approved by two-thirds of the legislature.
The country's electoral commission said there were no problems by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, for us and for Europeans", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name which would open the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018
In the parliament in the city of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small tower and packing seats in front of tents set up by candidates.
"We want to be members of NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with good intentions, which is not through coercion, said Mr. Kavadarkov.
"We are poor, yes, but we are respectable.
If they don't want us to be members like Macedonia, we can apply for membership to other organizations like Russia and China like the Euro-Asia organization".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would boost the economy of Macedonia, which also has a high unemployment rate.
"I hope that many will be biased because more than 80 percent of our citizens favor the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the vote for Yes would determine our future".
A poll released Monday by the country's Institute for Policy Research showed that about 30 to 43 percent of the electorate will participate in the election - a number well below the expected turnout.
A Telma television union reported that 57 percent of those interviewed by the station would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those polled said they would vote in favor of changing the country's name.
To succeed, 50 percent of the votes needed to be cast, plus one.
The rejection of the idea was the first failure of the European-style ruling party that took the lead in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero crosses the barriers behind Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the goalkeepers behind the Brighton team that Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received the ball in the middle of the field first.
He ran with the ball and kicked three back-hits and then got a chance.
Aguero then faced four Brighton players.
He then hit one of the back-guards and ran faster than the other guards into the box of the Brighton team.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, who was on his left.
The Englishman hit the ball once and returned it to Aguero, who with his right leg hit the ball from the goal to pass Mathew Ryan to the right of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from pain in his feet", Pep Guardiola, the head coach of Manchester City, told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that is exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he got the goal at that time".
But it was Sterling who led the team to a chance at the Cup.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a football scholarship to the Brighton regional team.
He then handed the ball to Leroy Sane on the left of the field.
Sane hit the ball several times and then passed it to Sterling by directing it to the goal.
Sterling just pushed the ball into the net as it was about to land on the boundary.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the European Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Sinheim Stadium, Germany.
Scherzer wants a special game with the Rockies
When the Nationals were pulled from the field of play, there was no need to restart the game.
But the hard-nosed Scherzer wants to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, unless the outcome is scheduled to play a role in the game in which the Rockies, leading the NL West, face the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies got a chance after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still eager to win their first league title.
"Even though we won't get anything from this game, we will enter the stadium knowing that the crowd here in Denver and the team will give us the biggest game I can play this year.
So why wouldn't I want to play it?"
The Nationals have not announced who will start Sunday, but it seems they are considering letting Scherzer play the game first.
Scherzer, who will be playing 34 games in the first half, made his preparations for the baseball game on Thursday and will play on Sunday after a full break.
The Washington native has a 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and has struck out 300 batters in 220 innings in two-thirds of the season.
Trump's meetings in West Virginia
The president made reference to Kavanaugh's election as he spoke of the need for a positive outcome for Republican Party supporters in the midterm elections.
All our achievements are at stake in November.
Five weeks remain before one of the most important decisions of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I'm not running but I'm running fast and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for the right candidate", he said.
Trump continued, "You see a terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to restore strength by whatever means necessary, you see, the hard, the bad.
They don't care who hurts them, who have to cross to get power and direction, what they want is power and direction, and we don't give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, are "against the ban".
"And you've seen this over the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry and cruel and mean and dishonest".
He also mentioned the name of the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein in the Democrat party, which was met with scorn from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Have you produced the document?
Ha, ha, what's up.
No, no, I'm waiting together - that was the worst body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a large congregation.
He does not allow others to express their feelings
When the Momentum activists in my party decided to criticize me, it was no surprise.
Besides, I am the last among Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all because of our outspokenness.
My fellow lawmaker Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she opposed anti-religious sentiments.
In my case, the experimenter has criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
There is a need for sound economic policies, for national security, for Europe, issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour Conference on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During my eight years as a Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights were the same.
Sadly, today, many conventions are not held as they once were and the promise of "good, gentle" politics has long since been forgotten or, if so, has been fulfilled.
It is also apparent that dissenting views are not allowed in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became prime minister, as my colleagues who I thought I was politically aligned with began to expect me to change and take on positions I did not agree with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak out - and it doesn't matter what I say - following the social media bullying they want to disqualify me, criticize local politics, tell me not to be a member of the Labour party.
And I am not alone.
Indeed, I know that I am better off than some of my peers as the comments made to me are political.
I am impressed by the skills and dedication of my friends who face sexual abuse or prejudice every day but are not ashamed.
One of the biggest disappointments of our political age is the way that stories of violence are viewed as normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the largest congregation and with any "disappointment" or change in the constitution the party shrinks.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years where they've encouraged me to keep my head down, not be too talkative, and be a better person".
But that was not the reason why I got involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, angered by the Thatcher government's failure to get jobs that left my entire class in the fall, I have tried to promote good public services to those who need them most - whether as a house councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed in any way by my policies and issues I disagree with with the new leadership.
To all those who have pushed the proposal on Friday, what I can say is that as the country enters a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and the public sector, I do not understand my intention to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for the constituency I represent, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no electoral or political disruption will stop me from doing what I believe is important to you all.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's undefeated team tops the table
Two goals in the second half changed the outcome of the game, but not surprisingly, Ayr were in the running to win the exciting Tennets League.
Ayr is top, and the only team to have never lost a game out of ten.
Finally, it was the good play of the defenders, who were successful in their team because their players did not use many of the opportunities that were available to them, to the delight of the team's coach, Peter Murchie.
"We've faced tough teams but we've never lost, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The credit goes to the Ayr team, they have used their opportunities better than we have".
The opportunity of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute was used by Ayr captain Frazier Climo, but the yellow card from Rory Hughes of Scotland, led to the Melrose team to score less through Jason Baggot.
Climo added to Ayr's goals through the penalty shoot-out and again scored before the end of the first half to give Ayr a 17-5 lead.
But the Melrose team started the second half well and the opportunity was taken advantage of by Baggot, who scored to reduce the score to five.
The game was then halted by the injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on the tail, after the game resumed Ayr added goals through Climo who pressed through the gap prepared by Stafford McDowall.
Ayr's second-string captain Blair Macpherson was also given a yellow card and released and Melrose took advantage of their superiority and tried to score against Bruce Colvine, pressuring the Ayr team.
The home team also scored, and after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo without a ball, on the penalty spot, MacPherson scored against Ayr.
Climo stumbled, as he did after the ball was restarted, after Kyle Rowe hit the ball into the box causing Gregor Henry to score for his team.

'The sea is ours': remote Bolivia hopes to court reopen the Pacific route
Seamen are in charge of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
The water camps from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have a slogan: The sea is ours by right.
That it is our responsibility".
Throughout the remote Bolivia, the memory of the beach that Chile lost in the bloody war of the 20th century is still alive - as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That expectation is perhaps the greatest for decades at this point, with Bolivia awaiting the decision of the international court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a dynamic, united and peaceful spirit, and it has great hope and confidence in the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian ambassador.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on major nationwide protests, hoping that the Hague court will support Bolivia's claim - after years of fair debate - that Chile should negotiate to give Bolivia a seaport.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's most popular president - facing a tough race for reelection next year - also has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some experts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia - and little will change.
The UN delegation from the Netherlands has no authority to assign territory to Chile, and has said that it does not recognize the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes just six months after the last hearings shows that the case "was not a difficult one", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean legal expert.
Besides advancing Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have restored the country.
"The issue of reaching the sea has been taken up by the local Bolivian authorities", said Zárate.
Morales' rhetoric has destroyed all that remains of good in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decisions were surprisingly swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity for a new relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict and for a fruitful relationship", he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales - one of Latin America's most influential presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will not give up its right to the Pacific", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to look back".
North Korea says it will not destroy nuclear weapons unless it agrees with the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his country will not destroy its nuclear weapons for the first time if it does not trust Washington.
Ri speaks at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor the promise made at the Singapore summit between the two leaders.
His remarks come after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming nuclear talks that failed three months ago at a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "just a dream" that continuing economic sanctions and US refusal to declare the Korean War over will bring the North to its knees.
Washington does not want to make such a declaration before Pyongyang begins to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang can be determined to give up what the country sees as its only defense mechanism.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil a number of recent hats on the way to the High Street near you
If you need a variety of hats or sunscreen, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled several large SS19 street hats that delighted and surprised those with other fashions at Paris Fashion Week.
Unthinkable hats were posted on Instagram last summer and the designers have brought their own stunning creations along the way.
Valentino's distinctive hat was a large one with a feather-like bead that filled the heads of the models.
Other larger additions include artificial ones like pomegranates, a strange hat and a pineapple - but they don't make your head feel warm.
Thom Browne also revealed some surprising masks - and on Halloween.
Many of the beautiful masks were lip-synched and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembles a swimming suit filled with tubes and glasses, while another resembles a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep talking about these fashions - you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that large bonnets may be on the highways near you.
The large hats are well-suited along with the 'La Bomba' shoes, a two-legged grass hat that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A religious symbol behind an unimaginable hat that spread on social media sent another giant creature to the street market - a beach bag made of grass almost as big as a swimming suit.
The orange, palm-tree-colored, white leather bag was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I look forward to seeing big hats and sea bags coming to the high street next summer - as a designer has been so influential it would be difficult to ignore the importance of big brands.'
John Edward: The ability to speak several languages is essential for all people on earth
Independent schools in Scotland have a very good academic record, and this has continued in 2018 with some excellent test results, which are only further enhanced by achievements in sport, art, music and so on.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible care for children and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen profession, and their status as global citizens.
As a field of study that can design and implement a human-centered school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be the most sought-after curriculum in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to my father in the language he understands, it just goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it touches his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and to rely on foreigners.
From the results of the latest tests of this year, we can see that languages are being learned by more people and are getting better in these subjects in independent schools.
About 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages did very well and achieved a Class A Specialist result.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a High A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved an A grade.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject of choice, being equally treated in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that for reasons that employers have struggled to find suitable people for jobs, 17 per cent report a shortage of people with language skills.
Language skills are therefore essential to prepare young people for future careers.
Since many job opportunities are open to language skills, these skills are important in the world.
Whatever career a person chooses, learning a second language will give him the opportunity to develop the same life-long skills in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign lands puts the multilingual person first.
According to YouGov's survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language sufficiently to communicate effectively and only French was spoken with the figure being two-digit, 15 per cent.
This is why investing in a language-learning program is now essential for today's children.
Learning more than one language, especially in developing countries, will open up opportunities for children to find good jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be of major importance in the UK in preparation for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in these fields.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to developing learning strategies in which they prepare children and give them the skills they will need to succeed, regardless of what may happen in the future.
It cannot be denied at this moment, in the global business world, that languages continue to be of great importance to the future of the world, and therefore this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "global communication skills".
Independent schools have continued to provide this choice, increasing and improving the performance of Scottish children.
It must be done.
John Edward and the Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans hoping to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of the game was not known.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James may be able to play for a few minutes.
Following a practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule".
"I don't need a pre-season game at this time to prepare", he said.
Trump's state of the union address in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is one of five Trump elections for tomorrow, including standing meetings in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his Supreme Court nominee stalled, Trump wants to call for a midterm election as his Republican party risks losing control of the House in November's election.
When and how can you watch the program online?
Trump's hearing is at 7:00 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the program live on YouTube.
Trump is due to speak at the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, which has sparked outrage because it involves Kavanaugh's alleged rape attempt while a conviction vote has been suspended for a week now while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of the rallies is to help the Republican Party win the November elections.
Thus, the purpose of the five Trump meetings is to "encourage supporters and the public as the Republican Party seeks to protect and expand its representation in Congress", according to Reuters reports.
"The fact that we have more councillors is a key factor in the president's decision to hold these meetings in more places as we move into the campaign season", one of Trump's campaign leaders told Reuters.
The convention, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, will be able to attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be broadcast on Pittsburgh radio", according to the West Virginia Metro newspaper.
Saturday will mark the second time in a month that Trump has visited the capital of Virginia, a city he won with 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Republican West Virginia Representative Patrick Morrisey, who is also running in the election.
"The presidential endorsement does not give Morrisey a good image", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA showcases its man in victory in its qualifying match to keep the odds as Sunday's game approaches
After three games, Saturday's four-man game could be a game if it were a Ryder Cup.
Change is a difficult thing to fix in sports but it is something that players believe in especially at competitions like this.
Who, then, have the privilege now?
"They led by 6 points but now only 4, so we take this as an opportunity", said Jordan Spieth as he walked slowly.
The European team has a chance, leading by four points with twelve games to go.
The American team, Spieth says, feels that they have much to boost, such as the success of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has done well and has been a good example.
As he and Thomas remained behind, the screams increased as the ball fell into the hole, making the teams four points ahead of each other.
His pitch won the game on the 15th hole and the crowd shouted the same, showing his confidence that the American team had not lost.
"You just have to put on some weight and focus on your game", said Spieth.
This is what all these players have here.
Only 18 holes later the team has shown a male.
The players with the most points over Spieth and Thomas over the two days are Frascesco Milinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are the current holders of the Ryder Cup.
The two beloved European players have won four out of four points and are not mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only two-player team that did not play near the hole on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes.
This, along with their encouragement and the fact that they are the best players the team can beat on Sunday, and no player can beat a European team better than Fleetwood or Molinari at sunset at Le Golf National.
Perhaps they are in different pits.
It is still too early to say that a European team has won the cup, at this point.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated team-mate Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren in a four-ball morning game.
His close-range ball and two hits in the first nine holes led his team to the point where the Spanish and Swedish champions were unable to come back.
But on Sunday there is no one to diminish his success.
Four-man football is a fascinating game to watch from a distance because of the interaction between two players on each team, the instructions given, the instructions not given, and the flexibility of the gameplay.
So far the European team has played well as a team and is heading to the finals with a good lead but the four-man game showed that the American team has a great potential, which is especially doubted by the Stateside.
European team 10-6 lead on Ryder Cup final day
The European team will have a great chance to play in the final game of the Ryder Cup after defeating the American team in a four-ball game on Saturday by 10-6 points.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who led a team that played with the struggling Tiger Woods, their victory at Le Golf National brought their points to four.
The European team, coached by Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to regain the trophy they had failed to defend two years earlier at Hazeltine, pressed the American team in their morning four-ball match, on a 3-1 schedule.
The American team was strong in the quadruple sculls with two wins, but it did not prevent victory.
The team coached by Jim Furyk needs eight points in 12 Sunday games each to win the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four consecutive points in his first appearance in the tournament and through his impressive performance this weekend, he and Molinari, who fans call "Molliwood", are the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, he also defeated Woods and first-time player Bryson Dechambeau in the American team by a score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who tried to pull out in two games on Saturday, has shown occasional bravery but has so far lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-man games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning four-ball, then teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the four-ball and won by 2-1 points over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's first and third.
On a cold day in the southwest of Paris, the European team did not pass through without a clear line.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the American team by two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 points over Jon-Rahm and Ian Poulter of the Spanish team in the four-man event and also defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4 and 3 in the four-man event despite losing their first two matches.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team with four points left in a single game won, although the defending Furyk team needs to match the other team to win the trophy.
After being the second team to do well for two days, Sunday's top-flight game looks set to be even more challenging.
North Korea says 'nothing' will stop its use of weapons
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continuing its isolation would increase its distrust of the United States and that there was no reason for his country to cease its nuclear weapons program in the meantime.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual meeting of the council that North Korea had taken "confessional" steps in the past year, including halting its nuclear tests and bombs, destroying a nuclear reactor and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal.
"But we have not seen America do the same thing", he said.
"Without trust in America we will never be satisfied with our national security and in this regard it is impossible for us to begin to disarm ourselves".
While Ri echoes North Korea's complaint about the "slow" nuclear disarmament of the United States, which should be credited with a major breakthrough, his words were effective because his country did not simply go as far as to disarm as Pyongyang has in the past.
Ri referred to a joint message by Kim Jong Un and Trump at the first US-North Korean summit in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to try to "stop the use of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" and Trump stressed security in North Korea.
North Korea has long called for an end to the war, but the United States has insisted that North Korea first stop its nuclear weapons program.
The United States has refused to ease the severe sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has been pushing for "an early nuclear halt" and has been increasing its pressure on North Korea, and the United States has been refusing to "declare an end to the war", Ri said.
"The idea of forced discipline is just a fantasy for people who don't know us well.
But the problem is that our lack of patience is increasing".
Ri did not mention the second Kim-Trump summit that the US president had spoken at the UN conference earlier this week.
Instead, the minister referred to Kim's meetings with South Korean president Moon Jae five months ago and added: "If the nuclear ceasefire had been between us and South Korea and not the United States, the ceasefire on the Korean peninsula would not have reached this point".
Still, Ri's speech was different from last year's address at a U.N. summit. When he told them that targeting American territories with North Korean weapons was easy while "Bad President" Trump called Kim "an expert" at a futile summit.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for being the first man to stop nuclear weapons, but said much work still needed to be done and that sanctions against North Korea should continue if North Korea does not stop its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a time limit, saying "whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have asked the UN Security Council to respect North Korea's actions.
On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions against North Korea must be maintained and will not be waived until we have a complete ceasefire".
The Committee has been increasing its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block North Korea's investment in nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would travel to North Korea next month to arrange a second Trump-Kim summit.
Pompeo has made three trips to North Korea this year but his last trip was not successful.
He left North Korea claiming that the talks had been successful but hours later North Korea countered him as giving "deceptive information".
North Korea has promised to meet Moon this month to dismantle a nuclear plant and a nuclear warehouse if the United States does "something similar".
They said Kim told them that the "similarities" he wanted were the security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and the steps to improve relations with the United States.
Harvard University students study a study to promote adequate sleep
A new study at Harvard University that began this year has given graduate students enough sleep to break the habit of reading all night by using 'sleep-inducing' drugs.
One researcher observed that students in the world's higher education system lack the basic skills needed to make a living.
Charles Czeisler, professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted what he believes is the first study of its kind in American history.
He suggested starting the study after a lecture on the consequences of sleep deprivation.
'After I finished the course a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I being told this in my final year?'
He said no one told him the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The study that began this year explains to students the importance of proper sleep in education and recreation, as well as its contribution to their health.
Paul Barreira, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the health center, said that the university decided to launch the study after finding that many students were sleep deprived, especially during the week.
The one-hour study includes a variety of interviews.
In one section is a picture of a hostel room, where students press a cup of coffee, curtains, teachers, and books to warn of the dangers of sleeping pills and lighting and how sleeplessness affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of getting proper sleep.
On another evening, students are told that sleep deprivation often puts people at risk for heart disease, depression, and cancer.
The school's detailed maps convey a message that encourages students to reflect on their daily life.
'We know it will not change the student's behavior' immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the harm of smoking,' says Professor Czeisler.
The prideful attitude of 'study all night' still prevails, he said, adding that new skills and student stress and study increase students' insomnia.
Ensuring adequate sleep, and in a good way the students' 'secret weapon' against depression, fatigue and anxiety, he said - and avoiding obesity, since lack of sleep causes the brain to lose vital energy and thus go hungry more often.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in health studies, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the study because he had learned one of the subjects taught by the professor during his first year at Harvard University.
He said that the study opened his eyes and moved him to encourage the professor to spread the message to everyone at the university.
Next, he wants all graduates to take a similar course before entering the university.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students set a time for their clocks to sound to remind them of the time to go to bed, and to be aware of the dangers of the light from cell phones, laptops, and electric lights that cause the sleep-wake system to fail and cause sleepiness.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal led Gerrard's team to surrender
The Rangers were again in a tie - when Dolly Menga's goal gave Gerrard's seemingly unstable team a 1-0 lead over Livingston.
Ibrox looked set to win their first league title since February when they beat St Johnstone 4-1, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's side to give Gerrard a second loss in 18 games since he took over the club, leaving the team eight points behind Hearts' top-flight side.
Menga scored with seven minutes left in the first half and the Rangers, who were lacking in encouragement, were unable to make a comeback.
While the Rangers have fallen to sixth place in the league standings, Livingston have climbed to third and are behind Hibernian by just goals.
And there may be more to come for the Rangers when backup singer Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after being struck by what is believed to have been a shot from the end zone.
Gerrard replaced eight players in the victorious Ayr team that reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
While Holt did not change players who played in a match against Hearts last week and must have been happy with how his team beat the Rangers.
The Rangers were the defending champions, but Livingston was the defending champion.
And he had to score in the first two minutes when Menga gave a good ball to Scott Pittman to score on goal while Allan McGregor was but the midfielder hit his ball on the side.
The ball from the box played by Keaghan Jacobs got Craig Halkett but Alan Lithgow but the defender and Craig Halkett hit the side.
The Rangers showed a lot of courage but it seems that they are just hopeful and not confident, especially when it comes to the goal.
Alfredo Morelos feels that he deserves a penalty in the 15th minute when he clashed with Steven Lawless but the players, Thomson, rejected the Colombian.
The Rangers only managed to score twice but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not hurt by balls from Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against the rules of the game, but it was a goal that was undoubtedly deserved.
The Rangers also failed to remove a ball from Jacobs' plate.
Scott Arfield did not block the ball as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who played slowly and passed the easily hit Menga.
Gerrard expressed his dissatisfaction with the Rangers when he dropped Coulibaly and replaced Ryan Kent and the change was able to produce good results quickly when the quarterback passed Morelos but the top player Kelly ran to remove the ball.
But Livingston's team forced the Rangers to play their favorite ball, and Lithgow and Halkett only took long shots.
Holt's team could have added to his goals at the end of the game but McGregor successfully blocked Jacobs, before Lithgow hit the ball sideways with a head injury.
Rangers outfielder Glenn Middleton cried another penalty after Jacobs was challenged but Thomson, the player, also turned down the offer.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago to today, is the COUNTING ... date on which future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring the energy released by the process of atomization, a process that eventually led to the invention of the Geiger Counter.
As a major scientific tool since then, the Geiger Counter has become a well-known tool, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are portrayed as unreliable scientists:
Brother: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, which is used to find electron salts, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atomic radiation".
Evans: "That is really amazing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the products are still there.
A new cancer vaccine may help the immune system 'identify' harmful cells
This new cancer vaccine may help the immune system 'identify' harmful cells and kill them
Vaccines have enabled the immune system to detect harmful cells as one way to treat the disease.
The procedure involves extracting body cells from the patient, and then transforming them in a laboratory
Then they can 'see' the proteins that are found in most cancers and then inject the patient
Experimental vaccines offer hope as they have been given to people with various cancers.
One recipient of the vaccine, who trains the immune system to detect harmful cells, saw her cervical cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells from the patient's body, modifying them in the laboratory to "see" a common cancer protein called HER2, and then reintegrating the cells into the body.
"Our results suggest that we have a vaccine to help us", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "fights several types of cancer, "including breast, ovarian, lung and adult cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
The same process of removing body cells from patients and "training" them to detect cancers will work in treating a type of leukemia.
After appearing on SNL, Kanye West launched a campaign in favor of Trump, wearing a hat with the tagline Make America Stronger.
The End Is Not Good
Kanye West was derided in the studio on Saturday Night Live after performing a performance in which he praised the US President. and said Donald Trump would win the 2020 election.
After singing her third song Ghost Town that night, in which she wore a hat labeled Make America Strong Again, she spoke harshly to the Democrats and repeatedly expressed her support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and they say: "How can you like Mr. Trump, and the racists?"
So, if I had been worried about prejudice I would have left America long ago", he said.
SNL premiered the show with Matt Damon as the Hollywood star slammed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's rape allegations.
Although not publicized, West's comments were posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock is trying to insult West with his posts.
Also, West lamented to the audience that he suffered a lot from his hat behind the stage.
"He found me behind the stage.
'Not going in there with that hat,' they said.
I was abused!
Then they say I'm in a state of disappearance", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: "Do you want to see a vanishing place?" saying that "he will wear my hero's hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His comments were twice derided by the audience and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying: "The whole studio just went silent".
West was brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when she sang her song I Love it, dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was helped by the head of the TPUSA self-help group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING OUT FOR THE RIGHT".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just being who she is and it's so much fun".
"But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe endorses and brings dangerous ideas into our community.
They have freedom.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that she had changed her name, saying that for now "I am Kanye West".
He is not the first singer to change their name and follow the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow singer, Snoop Dogg was once referred to as Snoop Lion and the late singing legend Prince, changed his name to a logo and then the singer who was known in the past as Prince.
Attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant shooting
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
His cases are covered by a Judicial Committee.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington is infuriated by the dreaded stereotypes about masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor challenged the idea of heroism, saying that such social media roles mean that young boys often feel that they must be mature to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed 'something is wrong' and asked about ways to combat the dangerous stereotypes about men in this #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels it is "necessary" to overcome the situation.
'For myself, I wonder right now - where did we put them to rest?' he said.
'What are we teaching men as they grow up, especially in the current crisis?'
Kit believes that television may be one factor in the development of this behavior but thanks to some of his male colleagues they are well behaved.
He went on to say: 'What are humans born with and what are they taught?
What is taught on television, in the media, and in society that makes boys feel that this is what they need to be to be a man?
I think that this is one of the most important questions right now - how can we change this?
Because something is clearly wrong with the boys.'
During the visit he also admitted that he would not play any Game of Thrones series when the series ended this morning, saying, 'I'm done with fighting and riding donkeys'.
Since November Kit has been participating in the reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a movie star and his brother who is a home-breaker.
The actor said that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing he has ever had in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the set of this play, so I found my eternal family and my whole life from here,' he said.
Rose was Ygritte, who was in love with Jon Snow's real name Kit, in a performance that also won an Emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in cases
The country has reported a 14 percent increase in HIV/AIDS cases.
An estimated 820,000 people in the country are infected, health officials say.
40,000 live attendance was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of these people were sexually transmitted, which led to a revolution.
HIV was originally transmitted in some areas through blood transfusions.
But the number of HIV infections through this method has been reduced dramatically, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people infected with HIV has been increasing by 100,000 each year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is particularly common among homosexual relationships.
The ban on homosexual relationships in China was lifted in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals has increased in the country.
Because of the world's anti-gay culture, surveys have shown that between 70 and 90 percent of homosexuals eventually marry women.
The virus is most commonly spread in such relationships through unprotected sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide HIV-related assistance to everyone in an effort to combat the virus.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee was the source of the information about the Republican congressman, saying that it is a "blatant lie" and "just a rumor".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied reports that her office had leaked confidential information from three Republican senators to the senators' Web site.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that the story was being spread by "individuals and websites" that were "devoted to public opinion".
"This is a lie, a terrible lie", Waters said in a message on the game's Twitter page.
The message contained the addresses and phone numbers of the two U.S. Senators, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The message appeared online Thursday on the Capitol Hill website after being posted by an unknown person during the alleged trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for attempted rape.
The message was released after the three advisers had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative party websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState also claimed that the IP address identifying the source of the site was linked to Waters' office" and leaked information about the Waters employee, Hill said.
"This nonsense is a complete lie", Waters said.
"My office staff - whose name and password and security have been compromised by the false report - did not publish the message.
This nonsense is a complete lie".
Waters' comments have been criticized by several online sources, including former White House chief of staff Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is an expression of anger", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that he is not fit to be a Member of Parliament.
If someone is falsely accused, there is no reason to be angry.
They should not be contemptuous of authority.
Do not be discouraged by the motives of the accuser.
He needs to be calm and calm".
Fleischer appears to be referring to Waters' remarks and criticism of the judges, Kavanaugh and the Democrats, who were criticized for answering questions angrily at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters from the midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"A very big story, if it is true", he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had notified "the appropriate authorities and the police.
"We will make sure that the people who are spreading this are identified", he continued, "and they will be held accountable according to the law for their actions because it is dangerous and disturbing to everyone in my office".
The cover of Johnny English Strikes Again - Atkinson's uninspired spy comedy
It is now common to see the benefits of Brexit in the European Union in every British magazine and this is also the case in the events of another Jonny English film - it was first released in 2003 with Jonny English and was re-released in 2011 with Jonny English Reborn.
Would a blunt and cynical comment on this matter point to the badness of making the world a commercial hub?
At any rate, the big-eyed, unconscious Johnny English had a knack for re-creating  to show that he had the ability to make a non-English comedy that reached a wider audience.
He is a central figure who even in his comedic performances is a police officer, and Bean and the British superhero are the equivalent of the message of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The story is based on Atkinson's visit to an old Barclay television commercial, which caused a stir.
There are a few interesting scenes in this new Johnny English film.
I admired Johnny English as he followed the plane in his old-fashioned protective gear and with knives hanging from his hat.
Atkinson's comic skills are evident, but his comedy is "strangely" deep and woven, especially considering that 007 and Mission Impossible have excellent comedy.
His humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's tours are less artistic and consistent than Atkinson's films in which he does not speak and is like Bean.
The opening of the article shows that Britain is in a serious crisis.
Hackers broke into the British National Intelligence System, leaking the information of all British troops stationed in different regions, which distracted a soldier stationed in another region - a minor part of Kevin Eldon's career.
It is the final product of a self-imposed and suffering prime minister, who suffers from her political infamy: Emma Thompson is playing the part of Teresa May in the final scene of her divorce, but the show has nothing to add.
His wise advisers tell him that since every spy working for the agency has been compromised, he should remove someone from his position.
And that refers to Johnny English, a former headmaster at a high school, who teaches about the operation of the undercover soldier: the pope is good, while English teaches various children about espionage.
English is rushed to a meeting in Whitehall for an emergency message and meets his longtime colleague, Bough, who is also picked up by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a naval officer, a self-sacrificing aspect of man that Vicki Pepperdine has not exploited.
So Batman and Robin the misguided Imperial soldiers are back in action, who meet Olga Kurylenko's daughter, the charming Ophelia Bulletova.
Now, the prime minister is distracted by the actions of a wealthy man who claims to be the solution to Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta, who has been taken over by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their work: pretending to be waiters at a restaurant, they set fire to a French restaurant; this caused a riot that led to their boarding the Volta high-speed train; and English caused a commotion when he tried to use a microphone to scan the interior of Volta's home.
All the final scenes take place in the final scene, but the way it is entertaining and self-pumping, it is a children's film in every respect.
A little bit of fun.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't British filmmakers give Rowan Atinkson a role to explore his talent?
The Labour Party denies proposing a five-day pay-for-work scheme for British citizens
Jeremy Corbyn's party has come up with a major proposal that would see British citizens working four days a week - but paid for five.
The party says it wants employers to share the profits made by AI with their employees by giving them an extra day off.
The new system will allow workers three days off - but with the same pay.
According to the data, this view may be "in line" with the party's economic policies and the ideology of changing the world in favor of the working class.
The four-day workweek reform was approved by the Labour Representatives as a way for workers to benefit from technological advances.
An official from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It cannot be done in one day but a four-day workweek is well suited to party policies so that workers can benefit from economic growth and new business practices.'
The Labour Party is not the first to make such a proposal, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 election.
However, this is not the view of all members of the Labor Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not a party consideration.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labor Party conference last week to offer his suggestions on how to change the way people benefit from the national economy.
McDonnell said he is determined to take power from the 'hopeless managers' and 'profits' of the corporate sector.
The president's policies also mean that water company shareholders may not get their money back in full as the Labor government may decide to 'withdraw' some of the money for reasons they consider wrong.
He also confirmed the introduction of a plan that would have employees register for a 10 percent share, which would result in a salary of £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's case will change their minds
The FBI investigation into the alleged murder of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by nearly a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the investigation should change any Republican senators from supporting him.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more bluntly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Actually, that's it", said Kennedy.
"I'm going to the hearing", I said, "I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, and his words came out, 'Did you do this?'
He was courageous, determined, unwavering".
Graham's vote, however, is clearly not going to be changed.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is unchangeable and must be changed only in the case of a serious offense", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who cites him can confirm this.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything that can change at the moment".
What is the International Festival of Music, and what has it done to alleviate poverty?
Saturday in New York City will be the annual festival where musicians from all over the world perform to end global poverty.
This year's festival, which will be held for the seventh consecutive year, will draw thousands of people to the Central Park grounds not only to enjoy the music of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to spread the message of the festival's real purpose of ending poverty by 2030.
The International Music Festival, which was launched in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, which fights global poverty by increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
To receive a ticket (unless you want to buy a ticket for the elite), the attendees must do a variety of activities or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the president, making a phone call, or any other clever means that can help spread the message of the cause.
But how much has the Festival accomplished in the 12 years before its goal?
Is the free-to-air format a good way to get people to act or is it a form of online warfare - people feel like they're doing something superior just by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Festival's organizers have reportedly received 19 million bids from their followers.
They estimate that these events have helped to motivate world leaders to commit and plan to invest $37 billion to help 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives from its operations, of which $10 billion had already been donated or raised.
It is estimated that the money raised has helped to improve the lives of 649 million people on earth.
Among the initiatives is the UK-based "Children's Development" campaign, which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to combat childhood malnutrition, after receiving 4,700 tweets.
"With the help of the UK government, the public good, international governments, and people like you, we can end the stigma", one of the world's leading health advocates, Tracey Ullman, told a London concert audience in April 2018.
The group also said that through over 5000 speeches the group was encouraged to encourage the UK government to improve the health of mothers and children, and the government announced financial support for the programme which will benefit 5 million mothers and children.
In response to a question they received on their Internet site: "Who do you think can end poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a difficult and long battle - and at times we will be weak and fail.
But, like the liberation movements of the past, we too can achieve our goals because unity is the strength.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the musicians who will entertain audiences at the New York City festival, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use military force to "stop" Russia from exporting energy - Minister of Foreign Affairs
The United States will "if necessary" use its naval arsenal to prevent Russian-made precious metals and energy from being sold to various countries, including Asian countries, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, according to reports in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's operations in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the country's legitimate government - are a sham way to gain access to the gem market and power.
"I believe that Russia has sent its people to Asia to find its energy market as it does to the European consensus", he said.
And, he added, there are ways to deal with this.
"America has such a capability that, with our Navy, we can open the gates and if necessary block their power from reaching the market", he said.
Zinke said so at a meeting organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in America.
He said that Washington's fight against Russia is similar to that against Iran, saying that its goal will be the same.
"The economic strategy of Russia and Iran, is the same, to develop and change oil", he said, comparing Russia to "a profit-making enterprise" on oil.
This comes as the Trump administration is pushing to promote its oil exports to Europe, replacing cheap Russian oil.
In this, the Trump administration including the president Donald Trump, is trying to force Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 deal with Russia, Trump said that the deal made Germany a "slave" of Russia".
Russia has been claiming that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which is to increase its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters by multiplying by length and width, is just an economic project.
Russia has accused the United States of opposing the plan for economic reasons and its opposition is an example of commercial repression.
"I believe we agree that the energy trade cannot be a threat and that consumers should have the right to choose who sells it", said Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American policy was not well received by Germany, and Germany has insisted on continuing its cooperation with the plan.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States to remain neutral in the European energy and Russian-German alliance.
"I am very disappointed when another country interferes in our energy purchases", said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI, after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously" consider participating in the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Representative says
On Saturday Massachusetts representative Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously" consider participating in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
At a convention in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would decide to participate.
Warren responded that it was time "for the mother to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included the great mother", according to The Hill.
"After November 6, they want to "think hard"' about going to the presidential elections".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the conference, saying that he "is taking the region in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was at the forefront of criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh who were nominated to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "we really need an FBI investigation before we vote".
Union data released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren County residents do not think it is appropriate to run in 2020.
Ninety-eight percent of the "absolutely" voters in Massachusetts said the senate should not participate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent agreed with the issue of participation.
The poll shows that a majority agree that former Governor Deval Patrick should be involved, with 38 percent supporting the possibility and 48 percent opposing it.
Other notable Democratic nominees for the 2020 presidential nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a good decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin discusses the PTSD issue with Track Palin at the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted on Sept.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
"What my son went through, what he went through on the way back, I can understand other families who have been affected by PTSD and some of what our military is going through", he told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that her arrest is "a big story that no one wants to talk about" and that regarding her son and other veterans, "they come back a little changed, they come back strong, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what fellow soldiers and workers, and any other member of the military, have given to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, obstructing a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. oppose new refugee protection law
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are opposing a new U.S. law that denies assistance to people fleeing terrorism and domestic violence.
Lawyers from 18 states and territories on Friday filed a lawsuit in Washington to defend a refugee seeking asylum who is also opposed to the law, according to NBC News.
The name of the complainant in the Grace v. American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed in August against government policy was not disclosed.
She also claimed that her husband "and a gang of violent children" were harassing her but US authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Lawyers for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which bring large numbers of asylum seekers to the U.S., as countries with high rates of gang violence and domestic violence.
A new US law on refugee protection from terrorism amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for protection.
District of Columbia Chief Justice Karl Racine said in his Friday statement that the law "disregards decades of federal, state, and international law".
"The law requires that all refugee complaints about threats be dealt with on the basis of facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates the law", the lawyers said.
The attorney also summarized the ban as a potential economic disaster for the U.S., saying that the immigrants could be businessmen and "essential workers".
In mid-June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide safe havens for victims of domestic and community violence.
"Protection is granted to those who have fled their homes because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", the Court said in announcing the ruling on June 11.
Providing security did not mean solving all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
Emergency rescue operations are underway in Palu to find survivors as the death toll doubles
For survivors, things are getting worse.
"It's very difficult", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her son with fever at the emergency room in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances bring in the bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
People are seen returning to their ruined homes, packing their belongings through the floodwaters, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were devastated by the 7.5 magnitude quake, could not cope with the needs.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken her spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of the ongoing earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed through the rubble of the wall, thinking, "Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope he is well".
The United States has accused China of 'disturbing' trade communications
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial article in the American newspaper criticizing the US-China trade agreement, the US ambassador to China said China was using the American newspaper to spread false information.
U.S. Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made a special statement to the Des Moines Register - a major newspaper in Iowa City, which was bought by a Chinese newspaper - after the president accused China of trying to interfere with the November 6 U.S. Senate elections, a charge China denies.
According to Reuters, the US presidential election case against Trump is a new campaign against China.
While it is legal for foreigners to publish commercial information in the press, China and the United States are engaged in a trade dispute, which has led to high tariffs on imports.
China's import tax was aimed at eliminating businessmen from Iowa who are affiliated with Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese-American analysts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and mayor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China's actions have hurt American workers, farmers and merchants.
"China is taking a more active role in this mess by putting false advertising messages in our own leaflets", said Branstad, writing in the Des Moines Register.
"In spreading its lies, the Chinese government is exploiting the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press that America prides itself on by paying for advertising in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a street newspaper shop here in Beijing, you will find few critical comments and you will not see any criticism of the Chinese people's economic problems, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
Without naming his newspaper, they added that "one of China's leading newspapers refused to publish" his article.
Republican Party excludes female voters in Kavanaugh scandal, researchers warn
While many Republican leaders are in favor of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court even though Kavanaugh is suspected of attempting to rape women, experts say this will cause problems, especially from women in the upcoming election.
The issue has sparked outrage, and the Republican Party has publicly declared that it is ready to vote for Kavanaugh's nomination.
These things are irreversible", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School on the Syracuse University campus, in an interview with The Hill newspaper in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that promoting an FBI investigation by Arizona State Senator Jeff Flake on leave would ease the anger of voters.
"Mommy can't forget what happened yesterday - won't forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, head of the women's group MoveOn, Friday, according to a Washington DC newspaper report.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted  November Coming! as they protested in the lobby of the legislature as Republican lawmakers decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic newspaper reported.
"Interest in democracy is waning", political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the newspaper.
"People say the interest has been high; it is true.
But it would be particularly high among urban women and young voters aged 18 to 29, who, while not favoring the president, do not vote".
Even before Ford's evidence of Kavanaugh's rape plot was revealed, experts warned that if the Republican Party were to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination, the public would be furious.
"This has shown the corruption of the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week according to NBC news reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh's admission as a Supreme Court justice, but the way the Republican Party has handled the case and the way it has dealt with the woman", Guy Cecil, director of the American Interest Group, a Democratic lobbying group, told the newspaper.
However, Americans seem to have a divided opinion on who to trust based on the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with many siding with Kavanaugh.
The new YoGov union found that 41 percent of union participants believed Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said Ford lied in his testimony.
Following Flake's allegations, the FBI is investigating the case reported by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
The sworn-in Ford testified before the House Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that Kavanaugh showed her her nakedness at a party while she was a student at Yale in the 1980's.
The creators of the World Wide Web plan to launch a rival to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is developing a Web site that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The scientist's new project, called Inrupt, is a company that wants to continue when Berner-Lee's redesigned Solid program was terminated.
Solid allows users to choose how much to store and what content to view.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "to outdo everyone".
"We have to do it now", he said of the site.
"It is wonderful news".
The software will use Solid's software technology to allow people to create their own "online storage" or POD.
The program can store, schedule, calendar, music, and other personal and work information.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all connected at the same time.
A unique feature of the privacy system is that users have the freedom to choose who can view what information they want to see.
The company describes the launch as "a message-based campaign".
CEO John Bruce said our focus at Inrupt is to bring the right products, processes and technologies that will make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, security systems purchased by IBM, computer engineers hired to develop the software, and a variety of volunteer technicians.
Starting this week, computer engineers around the world have been able to edit their own software using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his colleagues are not in discussion with the owners of "Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a full-scale overhaul that would temporarily put all their operations into place.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on the Medium website posted on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's goal is to provide business and environmental impact to protect the technology and value of this new software from Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he launched his website, the World Wide Web, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been speaking at a debate about the need for a unified Internet.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the owner and CEO of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new program", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A pastor who received the Victoria Cross after fighting in World War I is celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the Civil War as a soldier is still celebrated in his hometown a century later.
The shepherd Lt. Col. Bernard Vann discovered the speck on September 29, 1918, at the conspiratorial battles of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a secret agent and did not realize that he had achieved this high rank in the British army.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons on a plaque in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that "it was a great achievement" for the stone to be displayed a century after his grandfather's discovery.
On September 29, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his troops across the Saint-Quentin River "in fog and under heavy fire from a cannon and machine gun", reports the London Gazette.
Then he hurried ahead and "out of the blue" and alone led his troops to seize the cannon and kill the soldiers of three divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German undercover soldier on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandmother's example was "something I knew I could not do but taught us humility".
He and his brother Dr James Vann planted the cornet after the pelete, which is conducted by and for the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he felt "honored to be part of the panel" and added that "the courage of his in-laws is reflected in the many memorial services".
MMA fans didn't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206, instead they were shown Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the giant Bellator 206 play and then finally get out of the picture.
The program from San Jose consisted of 13 debates, including six on the main card and was broadcast overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, UK viewers were shocked when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were not happy to stay awake until late in the evening, especially in anticipation of the battle.
One follower on Twitter described the program's transformation into a children's cartoon as "just a joke".
"It is a state policy that at 6 a.m. this was not to be shown so it had to be turned into a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's deputy director of marketing and communications, when asked about the matter.
""Please pig, "yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would closely review their programming plans to include UK viewers in the future.
We're thinking about repeating the program, and I think maybe we can do that", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there and we can't do this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work hard to make things work.
In fact, the moment it changed, there were a lot of letters going around, and not all of them were good.
We worked hard to fix it, thinking that it might be a mechanical problem.
But it was not. It was a government matter.
I promise that this will never happen again.
We will be planning five fights instead of six - as we do - and we tried to feed our fans continuously and only missed the target in doing so.
It is very difficult".
Desert Island talk show: Tom Daley 'hides' about his favorite group
An Olympic diver grew up hiding his favorite team, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize until he was in high school that "everyone is different from me".
Speaking on the first of four interview programs on Desert Island hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said that she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent makes him less focused on winning his games.
The presenter, Kirsty Young, has been absent from the program for several months because of illness.
Speaking on the Laverne show's opening night, Daley said that growing up he felt "backward" because "it was not legal to be attracted to boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "the feeling of being left out and the feeling of being different have been the motivation and the strength to succeed in my sport".
He wanted to show people that he was "one of his own", he said, so as not to offend anyone who learned of the group he was interested in.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent gay rights activist and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge many countries to legalize same-sex marriage.
She said she speaks because she feels that she was fortunate to have remained free even though she has confessed her love for her fellow man and so wants to provide "an encouragement" to others.
The three-time world underground champion said falling in love with a man - American actor Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "was a shock".
Daley married the actress, who also won an Oscar, 20 years her senior last year, but she said the difference was minor.
"You get a lot of things at this age"  she competed in the Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find someone who had the same spikes she had.
In June the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "their outlook" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I was thinking about winning the gold medal", he said.
"But you know, there are many things that are more valuable than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he was dying and one of the things he asked before he died was if his tickets to the 2012 London Olympics had been sold - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wouldn't tell them you wouldn't be ahead because you would be dead", he said.
"I held his hand as he died and it was only when he died that I realized that he was not forever", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was my dream - to drown in front of an audience at the Olympic Games, and there was nothing better", he says.
This also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which inspired him in preparing for the Olympics and still gives him a sense of humor.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's sluggish performance was left out of Saturday's Ryder Cup game
Phil Mickelson of the United States has been setting records with his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday but he needs to play more than he has in the middle to make it a disappointing record.
Mickelson, playing his 12th game in two years, was sent off and replaced by manager Jim Furyk in a four-ball, four-man match.
Instead of being a part of the day's action, the five-time American champion sits around shouting and preparing to improve his game.
The 48-year-old, who was not a great threat in his prime, is not a good fit for the tough Le Golf National tournament as hitting the ball over long distances is punishing for the bad batsmen.
And if the competition is not too dangerous, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face British champion Francesco Molinari, who played alongside Tommy Fleetwood, the first new player in the league to win four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the 12-point opening game, can play well, Mickelson's performance could be of great importance.
Furyk said that he trusted the expert, but he did not say much.
"He understood what he had to do today, complimented me and hugged me and told me that he would be ready for tomorrow's performance", Furyk said.
"He is self-confident.
He is a professional who has scored and has done a lot for the team in the past, and this week.
I don't expect him to play two games.
I expected them to play a lot of games, but that's just the way it is and that's how we felt we should do it.
He wants to play like everyone else".
At Sunday's game Mickleson has surpassed Nick Faldo in playing more games in the Ryder Cup.
This will result in his playing in the final which is also unlike his playing solo.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, yet Furyk says his presence is a source of strength for his team.
"He is fun, sarcastic, funny, and sociable, and a good person to be with", she explained.
"I think the young players enjoyed playing with him, this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than playing".
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his lead may be lost
Thomas Bjorn knows from past experience that their lead in the Ryder Cup singles may easily turn into a difficult one to defend.
The Danish player played his first game in Valderrama in 1999, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the American team but only managed to win by a score of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we were very much ahead in Valderrama; we were very much ahead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but with fewer points", Bjorn said, after watching the best team in 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead in the Le Golf National tournament.
So history teaches me and everyone on this team that the game is not over.
We must persevere.
Let's go to the theater and do well.
The game did not end until we had scored more points.
We have the same goal - to try to win the cup, and that is where we should focus our attention.
I've always said that I'm interested in the 12 players on our team, and we know the players we're playing against - the best players in the world".
Rejoicing at the way his players competed in the difficult golf course, Bjorn said: "I could never feel alone.
Tomorrow's game is another.
Tomorrow the individual's skills will be revealed, and this is a difficult thing to do.
It is fine to play with friends when things are going well, but playing alone, like golfers, is a complete test.
The message you have to give to the players is to be the man of the match tomorrow.
You leave your partner and he has to do it himself".
In contrast to Bjorn's team, Jim Furyk will want his players to be more resilient than they were playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the change, having been a member of the team that won in Brooklyn before being a member of the team that lost when the European team "performed miracles" in Medinah".
"I remember everything", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players on the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games but we have to get it right early as you saw in Brooklyn and in Medinah.
If this happens in one game, the midfielders are under pressure.
We have planned our games and we have arranged the players so that we can do something amazing tomorrow".
Thomas has been assigned to start the team's lead and will play Rory Mcllroy in the main draw, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play against European team players based on the European roster.
"I put the players in this way because I hope they will help us through to the end", he said of his selection of players for individual events.
The German naval architecture has been rearranged
The new German warship was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace the old one used in the Cold War but the ship will not be operational until next year due to the failure of the railway program and fluctuating prices, the national newspaper reported.
According to Die Zeit newspaper reports after an interview with a military spokesman, the present launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead train of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been postponed until the first quarter of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 but the difficulties caused the launch of the ship.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class trains purchased in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class trains.
We hear of powerful guns, tankers, and destroyers, as well as advanced technology, such as stealth aircraft.
The other important thing is that the ships can be used for a long time before being repaired - they can be used away from our ports for two years.
However, the delay in the launch - which would have changed the German system abroad - means that the ships will be operational after the war, reports Die Zeit.
The F125's uncertainty was made public last year when the German navy refused to commission it and returned it to the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy had returned a ship to a shipping company.
The reasons for the return were unclear, but German newspapers reported that there were "problems with the necessary software and hardware" on board that rendered the ship useless if it was used.
The complexity of the program was a major factor because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are designed to carry 120 passengers - half the number of soldiers on the older Bremen class ships.
Moreover, it was discovered that the ships were too heavy, which reduced their efficiency and forced the military to improve their performance.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ships weigh 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of the ships used by the German army during World War II.
Besides the technical flaws, the cost of the entire operation - including training the crew - is disruptive.
It reportedly cost €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the original budget of €2.2 billion.
The problems with these ships are becoming more and more important as the German navy's technological capabilities are reportedly declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's security committee, admitted that the troops "lack a train".
The official said that the reason for the delay was that the old ships were no longer in service and the new ones were not delivered.
He pointed out that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were intended for use by the German Navy.
The National Trust surveys the lives of bats
A new study being conducted in a house in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use geography to hunt for food.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on these unique flying animals and help guide future conservation efforts.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will look closely at the well-known species and the soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown-headed and Daubenton species of bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed around the area needed to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct surveys on a mobile basis.
A sound-recording test will reveal how often the bats are crying and what kind of response they are having.
A map of their location and reporting can also be made to provide more information about their location and behavior.
Rob Dewar, a safety consultant at NTS, believes that the results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This will help to determine the value of conservation work such as planting a better type of grass and how to care for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the way bats congregate for daytime rest and the loss of their habitat.
Wind and light can also pose a risk, such as fly-trapping paper and other building materials, and being eaten by cats.
The lame are not blind.
However, their night-time hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when they are on the hunt.
They use advanced technology to detect flying insects and obstacles.
The NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 important farms and 76,000 acres throughout the country, considers bats to be of great value.
It has ten well-trained experts, who often conduct research, observe the bat's daytime resting areas, and sometimes perform rescue work.
The Society has also established one and only bat sanctuary in Scortland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight species of Scottish bats.
The park's manager, David Thompson, says that this is a good place for them.
"Here in Threave we have the best bat habitat", he said.
"We have old houses, lots of old trees, and all the good stuff.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so the work we do here and in other homes will help us to understand more about what they need to survive".
He also suggested that bat inspections be carried out before building houses, since destroying one bat breeding site could kill 400 females and young bats, and that could kill all the bats in the area.
The animals are protected and are not allowed to be killed, tortured or disturbed or to destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, director of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, has urged people to do the same.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and we still don't know much about our bat species", he says.
Ronaldo refuses to rape and his lawyers want to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the allegation of rape is "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers want to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the article.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus player is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was reportedly paid $375,000 to keep his mouth shut, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers hours after the announcement, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just trying to get out of the car.
What they said today, is a lie", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said through a camera.
"They want to glorify themselves by using my name.
It is not uncommon
They want to be known by my name, but that is the nature of the work.
I am a happy and good person", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are planning to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they say are "unwarranted reports of suspected privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the actor could seek compensation for the moral violation in proportion to the magnitude of the case, which is likely to be the largest defamation of human rights in recent years".
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's bedroom, where they allegedly raped him, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The mayor said Ronaldo knelt after the statement and told him that he was "99%" a "good man" who had failed by "only 1%".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but it was after a consensual agreement.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police station where pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter on her own because she felt "fearful of retaliation" and worried about "public embarrassment".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse her decision to settle the matter on her own while she continues to feel hurt by what she claims happened.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he moved to Italy's biggest club, Juve, for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' with the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its position as the world's number one car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He also said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it could temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a consensus", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker said that delays at the border if there is no Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year with 90% exported to other European Union countries.
"My guess is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we could see production cease in our factory", says Marvin Cooke, general manager at Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK carmakers have expressed concerns about the issue of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border purchases and sales will be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is said to be closing its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
A major concern for carmakers is the perceived uncertainty about the delivery of goods to consumers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota manufactures its cars "on demand" from its customers, with components arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars produced on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that industry says could cause delays and shortages of fuel.
It is unlikely that Toyota will handle a day's production at its Derbyshire plant, the company has said, so production could be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union "is set out precisely to avoid delays at the border".
"We want to have a very good partnership that will allow as I say not just a matter of winning right now but to take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 on the Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with the successful approach of delivering products to consumers".
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but in the long run, it indicated that the surcharges could reduce the factory's sales rate against other factories and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston worker and Unite union organizer at the factory, says that members are deeply concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have established a precise and reliable framework for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House officials say
The high-profile meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the battle against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House officials said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, collusion between Trump's aides and Russia and the president's potential for obstruction of justice.
The issue of whether or not Trump should remove the federal attorney general, thus undermining Mueller's freedom, has been a source of controversy for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed installing a recording device to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there were reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to remove Rosenstein from office but the meeting was later postponed to coincide with a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate for a week the charges against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date for this has not been set, it may be this week, and I can see that it is delayed by another week in view of all the other proceedings with the high court.
But we'll see how it goes and I like the media to be up to date".
Some media may dispute this: Sanders has not been with the press at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the decline in meetings was not due to the "TV" media's "love of fame", although he added: "I cannot deny the fact that they love fame".
He then said that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president who has ever lived", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We have looked at those numbers".
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders added, but "if the press has the opportunity to question the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this very hard and you have seen us do this in the last few weeks and this will be done instead of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States directly".
Trump always answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in talks or interviews with dignitaries.
Personal press conferences are few.
In New York this week the president may have shown why, making a free and sometimes unexpected appearance before the assembled press.
Health secretary calls on EU staff at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The health secretary has written to EU staff at Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and wishes to remain on Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months later for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to fully pay the application fee to EU citizens working for it.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are ongoing, with the hope that elections will be held by the end of this rainy season.
But the UK Government also urged to prepare for what could happen if there was no agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
This is why I want to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of where they come from.
Friends from all EU countries, and beyond, come as experts who are instrumental in improving health services, as well as helping patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home absolutely and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie Suddenly Surgery After a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery on a head injury Saturday when his team lost 31 to 27 to the Vanderbilt Commondores, said Mike Organ, a Tennessee reporter.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred near the end of the first half.
"He came to the side and then fainted", Reed said.
The teachers and doctors put Abercrombie on oxygen in the yard immediately before putting him on the tail and taking him to the hospital for a proper examination.
An official at Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been discharged from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no initial information is available" and that the Tennessee State Police are investigating the time of the injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, plays for Tennessee State for the first time since coming from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he intercepted and knocked out the opposing team five times, resulting in 18 interceptions and knockouts.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when buying property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This view will undermine the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people to vote for him
Additional tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Economists expect to earn £120 million a year- helping the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The proposal seems to undermine the success of Corbyn's efforts to lure young people to vote for him with promises of affordable housing and better-paying jobs.
Additional taxes will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funds will support the Government's plan to tackle the problem of sleeping under bridges.
The surcharge - which includes the tax paid here, plus the higher rates introduced two years ago on old houses and rental properties - could be about three percent.
The economists expect to earn 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 per cent of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to make the first real estate investment.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially within the metropolitan area - have become "villages without people" due to the influx of foreign buyers who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new law comes just weeks after Boris Johnson announced that tax cuts should be made to help more young people get their first home.
He criticized large construction companies for raising property prices by buying land but not using it, and he urged Mrs. May to give up her holdings in cheap housing to correct Britain's "housing scandal".
Corbyn has announced a series of ambitious plans for new housing, including rent improvements and "innocent" evictions.
They also want to give the councils more authority to build new buildings.
"Last year I vowed my first commitment to rebuilding the British dream - to making life better for every new generation", says Mrs. May.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a better life here.
However, it may not be true that it is easier for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes like hardworking British citizens.
For many, owning a home is considered impossible, and sleeping under bridges is still a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to coach the Scottish team
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says that his "big goal" is to become a Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish-born forward is enjoying a career-opening run at the North-East club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B grade and that's it", Ross told Sportsound of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up supporting Scotland in Hampden a lot with my father as a child, and it always reminds me of the past.
The opportunity will come, only, after I have done well in managing the clubs".
The first Ross as manager of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach is said to have been unable to follow up on the popular names at such a large club, having turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this stage will be determined by the answer to the question ' can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
From the design and materials available at the club, it is clearly a Premier League club", he said.
"It's a lot of hard work to get there, but I feel like I'm a winner with this club if I can get it back there".
Ross has spent just three years in his managerial career, having worked for a long time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as a regular in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to avoid relegation to the third tier, and helped St Mirren to win the Championship.
Ross is said to be feeling better now than he did when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Perhaps it was time to make a big decision", he recalled, about coaching Alloa.
"I really believed that the role of manager was right for me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I was successful, I had a good life at work, and I enjoyed other things.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things you need to do each week.
I still have the stress and pressure of work but the work of oversight is the best for me.
I always wanted to be responsible, and now that I am, I feel better than I ever have in my adult life".

The best time to drink is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, research finds
The summer heat has benefited Britain's struggling brewing industry but has caused a lot of problems for restaurants.
Beverage retailers saw a 2.7% increase in sales of alcohol in July - but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who also writes the statistics, said: "The continued heat and England's long unexpected participation in the World Cup will make July's performance similar to June's, when the liquor market saw a 2.8 percent increase, except for restaurants which suffered the most.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June continued in July.
Both beverage and liquor stores perform better than restaurants.
Food and beverage businesses also suffered during the summer, although not as badly as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out and have a drink.
Well-run liquor sales saw a 6.6 percent increase in the same month, and food sales fell by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, of RSM's leisure and hospitality department, said: "This trend is continuing what we have seen happening since the end of April.
Climate change and recreational or sporting activities have a strong impact on purchasing patterns in markets outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to suffer, and the 4.8 percent annual drop in purchases is a major problem, especially in the face of rising demand.
A long hot summer may not be a good time for the food industry and the passage of time will show whether the cold we experienced in August will provide the relief needed".
Sales volumes in bars and restaurants, including newly opened businesses, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new product launches.

One in five children has a private social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some under 11 years of age - have private social media accounts that are hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a high number of fake Insta accounts.
This article added to the fear that pornography was being sent
Twenty percent of students said they had a large account showing their parents
One in five children - some under 11 years of age - create social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a number of fake Insta accounts - according to the Instagram photo sharing website.
This article added to the fear that pornography was being sent
Twenty percent of the students said they had a large white account showing their parents, but they also kept some confidentiality.
A woman who had access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter noticed that the young girl was encouraging others to rape her.
A survey, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) in non-government schools, found 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two accounts, with half of them agreeing to keep accounts private.
"It is sad that so many young people are tempted to create a social networking site without their parents and teachers knowing", says HMC director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle and Scottish track and field athlete and race director Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for the sport's managers to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past 10 years.
"Eilidh is held in high esteem throughout Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we believe that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from bringing her to the club", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I want to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to really help and improve the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games among four Olympic medals he earned and is now a BBC legend, was left paralyzed after a drug overdose.
He wrote on Twitter: "Last month I had a stroke.
I cannot walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was hard work, but I recovered, now I am learning to walk again, and today I am doing a sprint!
Thank you for the encouraging message!
An advertisement for a milk-pumping machine that compares females to dairy cows has sparked a series of comments on the Internet
A company that makes milk pumps has taken down various comments and advertisements on the Internet that compare nursing mothers to milking cows.
To "start" a silent-operated pump, Elvie's company has released a music video promoting the freedom that the pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers in a cowshed of milk and grass dance a song with the words: "Yes, I bent over, but you don't see the tail" and "if you didn't notice that these are not cow breasts, they are my real breasts".
The song continued as follows: "Pump, pump, and I suck the babies, pump, pump, and I hug my wives".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a stir on the Internet.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, many saying it shows the "bad" side of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad idea to use dairy cows to advertise the machine.
As we must conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their young are weaned within a few days of birth", wrote one.
Elvie's breast pump fits nicely inside the breast clothes (Elvie / Mom)
Another said: "It's a pity for mother and child.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are keeping their babies?"
One added: "Such unbalanced advertising".
Some favored the download, with one woman admitting that the song is "funny"
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This is a bit of an inappropriate advertisement but I am not offended by it.
This is a wise thing to do", wrote one.
Another said: "This is a very interesting advertisement about a woman who pumps (usually at work or in the toilet) and feels like a "milk cow".
This is not a complimentary advertisement or a judgment on the dairy industry".
At the end of the video a group of women reveal that they all danced with the secret pumps.
The idea of the advertisement is based on the understanding that many nursing mothers say they feel like dairy cows.
Elvie Pump however, works quietly, has no wires or tubes and fits nicely into breast clothes, giving mothers freedom to move, hold their babies, and even move around while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a colleague and ECD at Mother, added: "Elvie Pump is a new product so it should be introduced carefully and with enthusiasm.
By comparing the similarities between mothers and dairy cows we wanted to make the subject of breast-feeding and its complications clear, and to show in an interesting and easy-to-remember way the freedom that this new pump would bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared at designer Marta Jakubowski's show using this pump.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Hide in a Camp at the Texas Border
The number of migrant children has risen even though monthly border crossings have not changed, perhaps because of the negative attitudes and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to give children to foster care.
Traditionally, many surrogates have moved abroad without a visa, and they fear that they will lose their chance of staying in the country by coming to look for a child to help.
The problem escalated in June, when authorities announced that asylum seekers and other elderly family members would be required to provide their fingerprints, and that they would share the data with border control authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had registered to help these unaccompanied children.
The commission later determined that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people whose dependents or family members are in the country illegally, and many of these people are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we continue to hunt", says Albence.
To help the children quickly, authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the custom, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via television, rather than in person, in presenting their petition to an immigration judge.
Those who may be considered unworthy of help will be promptly sent back to their homeland.
When children spend a lot of time in tents, they may develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violence or flight, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
The lawyer said that complaints are increasing in large areas such as Tornillo, where the signs of child suffering are often ignored, due to the size of such areas.
They add that bringing children to a tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare their hearts or say goodbye to friends can cause emotional distress that many already suffer.
Syria orders 'military presence' of US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign troops were in the country illegally, pretending to fight terrorism, and that they would "be punished accordingly".
"It must go away immediately without any further explanation", he said at the convention.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He added that Damascus would continue "this holy fight until we have eliminated all the territories of Syria" of all terrorist groups and "illegal foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and coaching Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops stationed in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that it is good for them to return, and he criticized "other Western countries" for "spreading fear unnecessarily" that made refugees unwilling to return.
"We have asked foreign countries and aid agencies to help those who want to return", he said.
"It involves politics in a matter that should be a matter of public interest".
The United States and the European Union say there will be no more aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN ambassador says the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe haven in the last major rebel-held Idlib has allowed for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish alliance has prevented the mass persecution of civilians by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, which has a population of three million.
Moualem, however, insisted that the deal "has a deadline" and expressed hope that the military will only target jihadist groups, including Nusra Front fighters affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who will be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and set the stage for a smooth election.
Moualem described the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that the group's work should be aimed at "reviewing the text of the current constitution", and warning those who want to disrupt the process.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With that in mind, Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election only if, as many observers expect, corruption and crime end his presidency before his time.
In what may be described as "The most amazing end of leadership ever!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, nighttime viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million nightly viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the most long-running shows with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"This is a problem that people are brought into because it's not what we understand best", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes President after the Capitol bombing.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another idea.
He recalls a time when he took a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? they asked.
"Because they make me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is something exciting about this.
Indeed, unlike anything else on the news, news from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Parking is a valuable resource that lucky spectators can afford.
And, it goes on to be a more informed citizen when you find yourself in the six-hour watch panel of experts debating how Bob Woodward uses "deep history" to acquire his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather suit ("a suit full of pride", said the Washington Post) and the scientific interpretation of the abusive body parts of Stormy Daniels for Trump, um.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario again either.
"One of the things they do that makes it look like a real show is that they give you something to watch every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pawn Stars", on the Trump show's recurring and daily events (deciding war with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
If you miss one, you're left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on northern Kauai, but he was too busy indoors watching MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN news.
He couldn't help watching that, not with the story of Brett Kavanaugh preparing to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court that depends on the outcome.
"I remember when we did all the crazy shows back then and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me to say.
"I thought it was just a joke, but it's obviously true".

Large sums of money are being spent to support midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a lot of spending, given the reestablishment of legislative districts that allowed two people to run for the same seat.
A recent redesign of the Pittsburg county map allows Democratic representative Conor Lamb to participate - who also won his seat in another county in a recent special election.
Mr. Lamb is running against fellow Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is closely aligned with the new 17th district.
The maps were updated when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were changed in favor of the Republican party.
The race in the new 17th district has led to increased campaign spending between the two major economic groups, the Democratic Campaign DRM Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Mr. Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a highly-watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The district has been a Republican-held district for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a narrow margin of victory.
U.S. Tries to Punish El Salvador for Foreign Aid, Then Returns
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already begun working with Beijing, without major opposition from Washington.
Trump held a warm-up meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until his colleagues dismissed the Trump Administration.
The State Department decided to recall the American ambassadors working in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties are only expected for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which include the suspension of financial aid and the withdrawal of visas, would have devastated the Central American country, which has high unemployment and high murder rates.
While internal meetings were going well, officials in North and Central America postponed a conference to discuss security and economics following the same conference last year that appeared to be a step forward in dealing with immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the coordinating authorities expressed their desire for the convention to proceed, and immediately dropped any suggestion that penalties be imposed in El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now planning a summit, now scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance of the summit, the ambassadors said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the controversies raised by three American officials, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations in a confidential manner.
Their accounts were verified by an outside expert who is close to the supervisors and also reported this in a confidential manner.
Learn From the Past
The next story that will happen may be the release of Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice, which now has clear evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in tampering with our election process.
If the Senate changes leadership, Trump will find himself facing questions to answer to that body, as he plans to meet again with voters, and perhaps eventually a peer court.
There are many questions to be answered, and I am not saying that Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor is it the European equivalent.
There are choices that all of us on either side of the US can make that will affect the duration of this war.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to plot against Hitler, provided that West rejected him and supported the Czechoslovak citizens in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible years that followed.
The past has been shaped by this unique history, and the democratic process can be accelerated or delayed by this.
Americans are experiencing several of these ways right now.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein has been in deep trouble since the paper also said that he had suggested secretly filming the president and that the president was not fit for office.
Rosenstein says that the Times story is inaccurate.
"What will we do if the recent request to the F.B.I. to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's case is inadequate or unfair - or if he has been confirmed as a Supreme Court justice despite the evidence of rape and forgery?
And most importantly, will we vote for the legislators who will make Trump accountable for his cases?
If we fail this test, democracy will take a long time to come.
But I hope not, thanks to the training I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had previously occupied my embassy.
He survived and eventually emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later I was sent to light a Sunday candle on a swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not have hope for our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers player believes he can do well in his team's game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, following their match against Spanish side Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers are due to beat Australia, which will give them a place in the second round of the Europa League Champions League, especially in Group G.
A knee injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans kept him out of his first game of the season until the day he tied Villarrea 2-2 but he believes the Rangers can use his performance as a good start to something big.
"The points we scored were important for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the stadium confident that we could do well in the game and scored one point.
We might have won the game in the end, but the short-term rivalry was no problem.
They did well in the first half and we did well in the second half and were the best team that day.
Next is a big game in the UEFA competition.
Luckily, we can take all three points but it will be a very difficult game because they won their games but based on our home fans and I hope we can stand up and win the game.
Last year was difficult, especially with my injuries and other changes in the team but now things are better.
The players are well and the boys are enjoying themselves; the preparations for the games are good.
Perhaps we can plant it now, forgetting about the previous season and do better".
Mothers spend hours sleeping because of concerns about how they will make a living after retirement
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of those surveyed in Nationwide said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want their loved ones to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to discuss it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the care of you if you do not give your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you need care, as those decisions may be important in determining costs.
Contact your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay off the debt.
Your source of choice for long-term care costs may include traditional long-term care insurance, a high-value life insurance mix to cover these costs or self-insurance with your assets - as long as you have the money.
Fill out your legal documents: Fight legal battles on the way.
Find a health care provider on your behalf to appoint a trusted person to oversee your treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to speak.
Also, consider involving a lawyer in your financial affairs.
You can appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your debts are paid off if you are unable to pay.
Keep things simple: Your elderly parents are in the hospital for a serious illness.
Can you answer questions about medical treatment and the conditions under which they suffer?
Write down the details so that you are ready:
"It's not just the money that needs to be fixed, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the cure?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for that.
Man shot multiple times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a rifle on his way home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, where he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred about 2:30 BST, as "random".
The victim did not know who was being shot.
His injuries are not serious and the police have called for help from anyone who witnessed the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Because of the failure of the communications system, emergency officials were unable to receive any information from the Donggala area, the northernmost region of Palu that is closest to the quake's magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the largest city in Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a small valley on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was commemorating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake.
Donggala is a region stretching more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coastline of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The area, which is under the county, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are important to the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the area around Donggala.
Nickel mining is also carried out in the province, but it is concentrated in Morowali, a coastal region opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim, and earthquakes are common.
Here is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake off the western coast of Aceh province in Indonesia's northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them Acehans.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing at least 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits Pidie Jaya district in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people are reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami erupted at this time, but over 100 were killed by buildings that fell on them.
2018: A major earthquake struck Indonesia's main tourist island in Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists suffering temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son jailed for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, tampering with the case report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crimes, she took the phone from him.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he claimed "innocent, true" after questioning, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanor counts, which could result in a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with Class B, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the beating
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Court of Older Persons
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with the report of the case and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the case.
His girlfriend claims he punched him in the face.
In 2016 Sarah Palin was criticized by senior military officials for linking the story of her son's abuse to PTSD that she said was caused by her work as a soldier in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed by a quake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos shared on social media show the exact moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu city during the tsunami's devastating impact on the coast.
Federal prosecutors want terrorism suspects in NYC to receive a rare death sentence
New York City magistrates want Sayfullo Saipov to receive the death penalty, which he is charged with terrorism in NYC and the murder of eight people - a strange verdict that has not been handed down by a federal court since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented car from Home Depot to carry out a terrorist attack on a bicycle lane near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on the road in October.
In upholding the death penalty, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight and "deliberately" seriously injured others, according to a motion for this sentence, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these cases carry the death penalty, according to a court order.
A few weeks after the trial, the high court found Saipov guilty of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder by fraud, which are used by the high court judges in such deliberate cases, as well as of assault and vehicular destruction.
The trial was "carefully planned and thoughtful", the judges said, describing Saipov's conduct as "horrible, cruel and extremely cruel".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury to others, as well as causing grief to the relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the petition said in a statement regarding the latero ruling.
Five of those affected were visitors from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York issued the death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was handed down in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed his innocence in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt better about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do this after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to details about his case.
He also asked to display an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He denied all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said he was "disappointed" by the decision of the federal prosecutors.
"We think that the idea of accepting the death penalty rather than accepting a request to remain in prison with no chance of release would add to the grief of anyone affected", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had already appealed to the jury to avoid the death penalty.
MP says NIGEL FARAGE should oversee Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to 'call a mob like a war' today at a protest at the Council meeting.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be 'forced' from the EU Opposition - as one of Theresa May's advisers put it - to oversee negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative, told the crowd in Birmingham that the UK 'would have pulled out' by now if Mr Farage had been Secretary on the Brexit negotiations.
But Mrs May's difficulty in regaining the heavily divided areas has been confirmed by the Anti-Brexit to take part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The official is trying to make his anti-government plan a good one against the Brexiters, the EU's Pro-Brexit and the EU.
His allies have insisted they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and have forced the EU Opposition and the Labour Party to choose between what they are proposing and 'disorder'.
Mr Bone told a conference entitled Leaving means Leaving in Solihull that he wanted to 'challenge the Opponents of the Brexit deal'.
He also suggested that Mr. Farage should be involved and be assigned to negotiate with Brussels.
'If that was how they were handling this, we would have gotten out of here,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit but we want to challenge the Opponents of the Brexit deal.'
Speaking against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'It is not true that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay.'
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, telling the press: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Being in the EU is not wanted by the people, the Opposition cannot accept this, it is not wanted by our party and activists who are fighting hard for us to be elected.
Please leave the EU and start listening to the people.'
For Mrs. May, he added: 'Officials like the prime minister keep their duties when they keep their promises.'
Farage told the audience at the rally that politicians should be 'forced' if they are unfaithful to the 2016 elections.
It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political establishment,' he said.
'They are trying to be disingenuous about Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you do this'.'
In his message to the exciting panel he added: 'I want you to pressure our politicians, who have a dubious view on Brexit.
'We call upon the secularist war-mongering that fought for us on Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, free and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the fight for EU membership passed through Birmingham before a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several protesters have raised placards saying that the Anti-Brexit party will launch this week.
The meeting was opened by Labour colleague Lord Adonis who criticised the Conservatives over the security issues he had encountered with their computer software.
'These are people telling us that they can implement the IT system in the country and the technology in Canada including, borderless disruption, free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit,' he added.
Warren wants to "think hard"' about running for president
Representative Elizabeth Warren says she "will seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democratic party member spoke about his future at a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is expected to be re-elected in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He is considered a potential contender against Trump in 2020
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with a state representative using the question-and-answer format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for Mother to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that included the great Mother".
Another arrested for shooting to death LSU player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday the arrest of a suspected gunman who shot and killed LSU player Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m.
He released a video of the incident on Friday, asking for help in identifying the person seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered head injuries and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, on 247 Sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot to death by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was in the area, with a weapon, and admitted that that's how he killed Wayde Sims with a gun.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and confined to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 forward who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 goals and 2.9 assists per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton has a chance to win the world championship by beating Sebastian Vettel according to the rules of the sport
It was clear after Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in the semi-final that Mercedes' team rules would play a part in the final result.
From the start, Bottas started the game well and Hamiliton did not impress in either division and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel took the lead in the preliminary round which left Hamilton behind, failing to win.
Mercedes arrived later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a wheel-spin that caused the Ferrari driver to exit inside freely at the risk of being behind to secure the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from behind the wheel and was seventh in the first-place finish on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he grabbed his tires to finish fast and beat Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth time.
He later came to the ready position on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a good job over the weekend and was a real fighter to say the least.
This team has done a great job to have two winners", Hamilton said.
This Was Not a Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the Senate's record shows that the people are "cruel and wicked and liars".
"One thing that can happen and the best thing that can happen these last few days in the Senate is, when you see anger, when you see people who are cruel and angry and mean and lying", he said.
"Look at the hidden information that has come out of the bucket, but hear the "wow, I didn't do that.
I did not do that".
Do You Recall?
Did you, Dianne Feistein, publish them?
You remember what he said... you put it out in the open - "iii, iiii, what?
Third, not at all.
I did not make it public".
Well, let's put it this way.
Did we make it public?... No, we didn't", Trump added in his speech, which makes it clear that he was referring to the senator.
Feinstein had received a letter detailing the Kavanaugh case filed by Ford in July of the previous year, and the case was made public in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide anything about the case that came with Mr. Ford, I didn't make it public", Feinstein told the Senate Committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"They told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret".
Such a firm refusal did not please the head of state, who spoke at a rally on Saturday as follows: "I assure you, this was not the proper way to speak with body gestures.
Maybe not, but it was the most disgusting form of body language I've ever seen".
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the president said the Democrats are using his statements to advance their own interests.
"Their goal is to regain power by any means necessary.
You see for yourself that these people are really evil, cruel, who don't care who gets hurt in their desire to seize power", the leader said, according to the newspaper Mediaite.
The main draw: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned the insult when they beat the Belfast Giants 5-3 in a home-and-away game at their home ground last Saturday.
Early in the game, the Belfast Giants led by two goals with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
But Dundee scored both goals with Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, and Dwyer of the Belfast Giants again led his team.
Francois Bouchard scored a goal that tied the score, followed by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scoring two goals that brought the Dundee Stars back to the top of the table.
It was the third defeat in an Elite League game that season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 through Kendall McFaull, another goal from Beauvillier through David Rutherford just four minutes from the first goal.
It was a busy opening session, as Sullivan returned the players to the goal at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie a chance to score a goal that tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer encouraged the Giants in the first half as he scored his second goal in the night's game late in the first half.
The home team Dundee came up with a new idea and Bouchard scored a similarly powerful goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played brilliantly in the delivery to Nielsen who scored the Dundee goal which gave the team its first lead at the end of the second half and added another dribble which led to a total of five goals in the match.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games in a row, are preparing to face Milton Keynes in next Friday's game.
Assistant Pilot Dies Helping Hundreds of Passengers to Escape from Earthquake
An assistant pilot in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after dying helping to land a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continued in the area, and many were trapped by debris in the city of Palu.
While his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace on the shaking platform at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed behind to help Batik Air Flight 6321, which was operating at the airport at the time, take off safely
Then he jumped off the tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the idea has saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a better hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sorry to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster management agency says it is difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to be rising as some bodies are still under rubbish and many are not being connected to see if they are still alive", said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu and there will be a funeral for all those who died on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: Every minute ambulances are bringing in bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Shoplifting is everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It is already a problem, but it can grow.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete any evacuation work.

Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini announces that one person is still missing after the plane crashed into the water
The company, which owns the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean, has also announced that the person on board is still missing, after initially claiming that all the passengers were rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini announced that by Saturday afternoon, it had found one Aboriginal missing.
It said it is now working with local authorities, health officials and researchers in the search for the missing man.
The company has not commented on any information it has about the missing man, such as his age or nationality.
Local boat owners took pains to rescue people as the plane crashed into the water as it was about to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Some officials announced that a total of seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers had not yet been discharged from the hospital on Saturday, but all were recovering well.
The exact cause and the manner of the accident have not been determined.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane crashed into the sea shortly before it was due to land.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the road.
Pilot Bill Jaynes says that the plane flies at the speed of light.
"This is a wonderful thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to cross the waist-deep water to the escape area of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were showing signs of gas and were screaming, and he said that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that boatmen working at nearby repair yards did much to help evacuate passengers by using boats to get them ashore before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG in the last 20 years but none involving Air Niugini.
Experts provide a list of the steps leading up to the time when the mother was burned alive
The prosecutor halted the trial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in a rigorous investigation.
He explained to the court how he used cell phones to match the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location information from several cell phones that showed that Tellis had Chambers with her the night of her death, which contradicts her previous claims, Clarion Ledger said.
When they showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was in Nashville at the same time".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after his death.
Evidence from cell phones suggests that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers's notes, most of which were titled after her name, from her phone.
"They took him out of his life", Hale said.
The opponent is expected to give his final argument on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped the case would go to court that day.
High Breed: What is hip hop marijuana?
Three hip hop musicians are considering changing the perception that marijuana is harmful by including a positive message in their music.
High Breed, from Bristol, said that hip hop music no longer focused on politics but on solving the problems of our daily lives.
The idea of the group is to bring back the influence of the marijuana sound to the original.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY child care provider suing a couple for sending "racial" messages
A NY day care provider is suing a couple for sending a racist message after receiving a lost message from the mother complaining that she was "some black person".
The couple denied any prejudice, calling the case "a form of theft".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed frustration after learning that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"TWO THREE MANS", said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmanto in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending the letter to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing her mistake, "unstable" Plasco-Flaxm fired Sister Maurice, saying that their former nanny, who was of African-American descent, had done a bad job and was hoping to find someone from the Philippines instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for dismissal, and he is seeking $350 a day for six months, the concert work he had been working on before this agreement.
"I want to show them, you see, you don't do things this way", he told the Post on Friday and added: "I know it's prejudicial".
The two defended themselves against accusations of racism, saying that it was the wise thing to do to dismiss Maurice, fearing that he would lose his trust if he were disappointed.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He is impartial.
We are not racist", a man named Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you hand your children over to someone who had wronged you, even though you had not done so intentionally?
Your newborn?
You people".
Describing the case as "a form of robbery", Plasco said that his wife was just two months from giving birth and was "in a very difficult time".
"Would you go out and fight a man in that situation?
It's not the best thing to do", the banker added.
While the case is still pending, a court of public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, rebuking them for their behavior and attitude.
The publishers of Paddington are concerned that readers may not imagine a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put someone in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is thrilling to know what we now know of the great success of this Paddington"
As for her father, the former BBC illustrator before being inspired to write a children's book with the toy teddy bear, it would be a shame to throw him away, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
Paddington's book, which he describes as "a very important part of our family", adds that his father was very proud that he finally succeeded.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not a rude man", he said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of him even though you're not the one who did it.
I think he saw Paddington's victory in this way.
Despite his creativity and his ideas, he always pays homage to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon arrival she rushed her daughter to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call repeatedly to say that it was really bad, and that he had no hope of recovery", says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad that he would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs prescribed for his heart pump were being drained and slowly being eliminated from his body.
He had been dead for a short time, and that was just the end of it.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and others.
I had to keep it to myself".
Later Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the death of her daughter, boarded a plane with others - unaware of her own plight.
"No one knows that", he said.
"My head was on the floor, and tears were pouring in all the time.
It is hard to explain, but there was a trip that I felt sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved me.
A grieving mother sends cards to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost siblings to suicide are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sending cards at the Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers for people to call in case of emergency.
Sister Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son had the good fortune to be a good cook with a great smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
She always says that her smile lights up the place".
However, he resigned before his death, being "in great distress".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother died in the aftermath of his brother's suicide.
"I worry about the outcome", says Davis.
Sister Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go to and talk to, even with a friend.
Don't just keep quiet - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother.
"She didn't say she was feeling depressed or sad or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw how they changed.
He was not very happy on Christmas day - when the children opened their presents he did not look at them or say anything".
She also said that her death was a great shock, but she has to endure it: "It left the family in a lot of pain.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep going and endure".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought, if we could find anything like what they're asking for - like a short-term, small-scale survey - we could maybe bring in a little bit of unity", Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid a fierce political battle.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is due to events that were about to occur.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to bring their candidate to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has been making phone calls to the Senate, urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush era and through whom Bush met his wife Ashley, who was his secretary.
What will happen when the FBI releases his report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the matter and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of rebels "decreased" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who have turned to South Korea for citizenship has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's foreign ministry, said there were 1,127 last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the better control of the border between North Korea and China and the high prices charged by smugglers are the reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang did not comment.
Many North Korean rebels are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views these rebels as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often retaliates by force.
Relations between North and South Korea - still at war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss nuclear weapons talks that had failed in the past.
This came after a special June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to work towards the destruction of all nuclear weapons in their respective Korean states.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that sanctions from the U.S. have been a major obstacle to the normal course of events ever since.
"Without trust in America we will never be satisfied with our national security and in this regard it is impossible for us to begin nuclear disarmament ourselves", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", said unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he lacks the intelligence to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview held Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had done this, she would have been 'crazy,'" Pelosi said in giving her opinion on what Kavanaugh would say as evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he had molested Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very depressed, sometimes yelling and angry when discussing his family and his high school years.
He also criticized the Democrats on the committee, saying the accusations were "vicious and an attempt to defame the human person" by free people who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that she should not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed her favouring the Democrats.
"I think they're getting away with what they're going to say and how they're going to talk to the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi questioned whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh by a vote if she was confirmed, and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"What I can say is - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that if a Democrat was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might challenge regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since she is seen as a Democrat lawyer.
In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he could overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a crazy, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not right,'" said Pelosi.
And the Wives Should Use This Method
And there, with a just rebuke, months and years of rage are flooding, and they cannot bring them out without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry", Sister Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was older than me, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but she made a plan that when she was angry and started to cry, she could say to the person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
And he just keeps going.
And I thought it was a good idea".
Tears are allowed as a way to express anger because tears are not fully understood.
One of the best memories of my first job, being in this office with many men, where I once found myself crying in a rage, was being grabbed by an elderly lady - a gentle manager who I always dreaded a little - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't let these people see you cry", she told me.
"He doesn't know he's angry.
They think you're sad and are happy to come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Hart was caught committing adultery on board the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the race, Schroede, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president.
"She made a bad choice", she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one person.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was a surprise campaign, he was behind in the money-making, and he was determined not to enter the contest unless he had a $2 million prize.
This was a failure.
She found that some of her helpers who gave $1,000 to men should only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
After announcing that he was not running a real campaign, his feelings - gratitude to those who had helped him, frustration with the financial and anti-voting systems, and anger at the discrimination - almost made him cry.
"You would think I was in big trouble", Ms. Schroeder recalls the media's reaction to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was a sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking, What will they put on my headstone?
"Did he cry"?'"
The light on how China can benefit from the conflict between China and the United States.
The beginning of the conflict was frightening and a junkie, but the conflict is still ongoing, and experts who are closely following the situation have found that the crisis could ultimately benefit China.
The beginning of this came when US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imported goods from China such as solar panels, various metals including aluminum.
The struggle seemed to reach a climax this week when the United States ordered a massive shipment of 200 billion dollars, or in some cases 150 billion pounds.
China has retaliated by imposing its own punitive taxes, recently ranging from 5 to 10 percent, on goods worth some $60 billion.
China has vowed to retaliate in the same way as the United States and will monitor the situation.
To stop the US, it is necessary to stop the cheap import of Chinese goods and attract the US, but to openly subjugate China is difficult because it can bring back the disgrace of the leader, Xi Jinping.
However, some experts say that the alliance could be a long-term benefit to China by reducing the dependence on the two countries, if China makes the right choice.
"Abgail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security and an expert on Asian affairs, says that "rapid decisions made for political reasons have the potential to disrupt economic activity in the United States and China more than some people realize".
Syria "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Ministry
Syria has said it is ready to return refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that things were beginning to improve in the world.
"The situation is now stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorism to restore a healthy culture.
Everything has been settled for refugees to come to a country they had to flee because of terrorism and economic policies that affected their daily lives and behavior.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government will receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that it could not receive any other necessary assistance or aid from countries that had supported the terrorists.
European team wins Ryder Cup golf in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA by 16 1⁄2 to 10 1⁄2 points at Le Gold National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost the Ryder Cup six years in a row in European competition and has not won the title since 1993.
The European team, led by fellow coach Thomas Bjorn, won the trophy with a 14.5 against the United States.
US team captain Phil Mickelson, who failed to show his manhood in the tournament, threw the ball into an inappropriate hole that gave his opponent Francesco Molinari a clear lead.
The Italian played brilliantly in all the games, making him one of only four players to score 5-0-0 in the 1979 World Cup.
American Jordan Spieth was not disappointed when he lost by 5 and 4 points to European Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who did not reach professional level.
The world's most famous player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 for 1 to England's Ian Poulter who is probably playing his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Ryder Cup champion, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European record holder with 25.5 points during his playing career.
"I can't really cry, but I still can't help it.
This was a difficult year.
I am grateful to our teacher Thomas for encouraging me and trusting me.
I am so happy, so happy that I have received this cup again.
The goal was for our team to win, and I am happy to have been a part of this victory", said Garcia, who seems to be very caught up in the success of his European team.
He congratulated fellow citizen John Ram who defeated US Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"I am most proud to beat the champion Tiger Woods, as I grow up watching him play", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and this time managed to score a victory in the Ryder Cup which came to 13-21-3.
This is staggering considering that he is one of the world's most successful athletes, having won 14 championships, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to get good results except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf in all events.
US general manager Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they've worked hard.
There was a time this morning when we were harassing a European team.
We fought a war.
All credit to Thomas.
He is a good leader.
All 12 of his players have played well.
We'll do some more, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll get ahead.
I love my 12 companions and am proud to be their leader.
We can say goodbye.
Let's face it, our teammates played better than us".
