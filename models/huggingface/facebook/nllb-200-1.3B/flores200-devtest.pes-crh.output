The scientists say that the ornamental feathers of this animal were royal oak at the top and carotenoid at the bottom.
This finding also adds to our understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the feathers of this dinosaur do not have a well-developed rod, called a stalk, but they do have other features of feathers - beards and fine hairs - so researchers argue that the evolution of the stalk was probably later than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers believe that even if this tail is a young dinosaur, it still represents the plumage of an adult animal rather than the fur of a chicken.
The researchers stated that even if this was a young dinosaur's tail, this specimen still represents a full-grown animal, not the tail of a chicken.

below are the medium-sized Sanani cats, who eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to mountain goats to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the sloth house cat) that eat large numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, snails and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the kenam, the specific thing that every San cat does to keep it from competing with others.
The lion is the most social of the Sanan cats and lives in large herds called herds.
Pride consists of one to three adult males, 30 females and one cub.
Women are usually close to each other and are a big family of sisters and daughters.
The lion group behaves very much like wolves or dogs, animals that behave remarkably like lions (but not other big cats), and are very lethal to their prey.
Like a hexagonal athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, stand long distances, and kill something five times stronger than a human.
The tiger is also in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four are the only felines that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the full sound of a lion's roar, but rather a phrase from a garrulous word.
Leopards love to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that a leopard hunts are much smaller than its body.
The American Way of Life is thought by scientists to follow animals by smell and find food, and by smell, track their footprints on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they can see well in the dark, and they can move very quietly. The American ocelot, for hunting prey, first lurks in the surrounding environment and then suddenly dives on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small community) is separated from the main community to which it belongs (such as when they migrate to the other side of a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different capabilities or adaptations than they previously needed to be considered a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment.
nce time, as their new population adapts to their new surroundings, they become less and less like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't be considered the same species.

Almost all computers in use today are based on the use of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer terminology these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits.
Internal toxicity is not immediately apparent. A symptom like vomiting is so common that it cannot be detected immediately.
The best cause for internal poisoning may be the presence of empty medicine containers or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "SAAS" in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitism in humans.
Both killer insects and bed bugs are resident, meaning they adapt to living in a hive or living in a host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a major neurological disorder in younger and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that the risk of MS in women is twice as high as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or that of their child.
The couple can arrange a parenting plan for their baby.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the universe works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
though not alone, it's an experiment and an experiment that is necessary to debunk one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations and also lead scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotelis's views were accepted on all scientific issues, including psychology.
As Greek learning declined, the West cut off its connection to its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
Many people associate physiological and behavioral rhythms with the existence of endogenous cycles and their production with the biological clock.
Rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, are recorded for most living things including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining systems that continue a period of a free-circle cycle in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic.
Hersh and Chace used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they marked the DNA in the phase with phosphorus, or the phase protein with sulfur.
A mutation can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether or not the cells involved are germline cells.
l mutations in the same microbial cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

Everyday morning, people drive from small towns to their workplace and get picked up by others who are going to work the same place they came from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transport system based on personal cars.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you'll hear almost the same level of complaints about water quality or falling stairs.
Why are transportation systems so complained about, why do we see them fail every day? Is it because of the inefficiencies of the automotive engineers? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of autonomous drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a problem, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range, so traffic flows tend to have a logical structure, and this can be almost mathematically determined.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three characteristics are determined: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) acceleration.
These relationships help with planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insekts were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to escape more easily and to find food and mate.
Most insects have the ability to turn their wings from behind along their body.
This ability allows them to hide from predators in a wider range of small spaces.
The only insects that can't fold their wings back are the snails and the day-flying mosquitoes.

Aristoteles, the philosopher, postulated that everything was made of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed that they change into new matter and form what we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.

A fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no sign.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and soil. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
Subterranean is thinner and subterranean is thicker.
As the shell becomes thinner, there may be more glass on the near side. The glass is easier to get up and to the surface.
Content theories are based on what there is that people are going to replicate or like.
These theories suggest that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are embedded throughout development and into adulthood.
Theories are about what makes people want to do what they do, and what's in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy of needs and the Herzberg two-factor theory.
e managers start leading their ex-colleagues, there are two behaviors that emerge.One leader is trying to stay one of the guys.
This type of manager makes extraordinary decisions, takes disciplinary action, evaluates performance, determines responsibility and holds people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes the unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team does and do it for themselves.
n't that?n't that?n't that?n't that?
This behavior often causes gaps between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are rated by the same criteria as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.

They often have more autonomy than contracted team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones but their local management may not realize these time zones.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and Lafaso, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Management team is an unobtrusive team to which each member reports.This unobtrusive team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go into the process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals is to implement the concepts of organizational learning innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational units of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can happen.
As a result, the process of organizational collaboration to overcome barriers can lead to a new creative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the sequential approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
The neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition, and so it narrows the field of study down and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour is the backbone of scientific research.
Long time ago it was known that different types of brain injury, emotional trauma, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies has allowed us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that had never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our brain processes.
Although AI has a strong implication in science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the AI industry involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
examples include control, planning, timing, ability to respond to customer problems and queries, as well as hand-held, voice and facial recognition.

AI is now used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, as well as being embedded in numerous home computers and video game software applications.

Technology offers solutions by making virtual science trips possible. Students can view ancient artifacts in museums, go to an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting alongside their classmates in class.
