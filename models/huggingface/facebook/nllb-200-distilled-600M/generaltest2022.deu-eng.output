The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a big PRS customer, so it's not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or an instruction to fix the package so you can track it as a return.
I ordered the PRS_ORG a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I'm really upset about that.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to borrow?
I also think that children should not be encouraged to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older brothers and sisters to take moderate care of the younger ones.
I'll look around, help, bring the bottle, etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy on his own for a short time and he's okay with it, that's fine.
You can judge for yourself if that's right for your kids.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 up and accompany you to bed for hours.
It's probably questionable, purely legal.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement came along.
Because if something were to happen, like a fire, a break-in, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is your choice, of course.
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story but I can't remember the title partout.
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a pet keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going to his prey cats in a fence.
The case is being handled by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation, has sent his therapist to a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
There's more suicides and there's another protagonist -- a photographer who gets an anonymous assignment before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document and put the photos online.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients are ultimately confronting their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out the window and another goes on her way to death)
This fear is called the fight in the book.
At the end, there's a big showdown at the clinic that was involved in a fire.
That's the rough story. I'm pretty sure the book was written by a French author.
If anyone knows this story or even can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, no, I don't have the password for the Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
It can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it possible to get the difference in price refunded ?
Child, 4 years old, split under the thumbnail
A four-year-old child has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outside) all the way down.
Tried to pull him with a pincet.
Very hard to reach.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
There's no more chance.
I'll see the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we can achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be incorporated into almost any locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm sugar cube speaker and sound capsule accessories.
Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It is a master of the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as natural as two- and four-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
RailComPlus® enables the decoders to log in fully automatically to a suitable digital hub.
It is able to control all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main line can be read with appropriate centers.
For central offices that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 levels at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic sign-in to mfx® compatible central processing plants.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake pads or with DC is also possible.
In addition, it also holds on to a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC commuting system enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC wires.

Because of Omikron , Johnson wants to push for a revitalization .
There are new cases of Omicron in politics and science in the UK.
The Commission has therefore proposed that all eligible adults in England receive a vaccine offer by the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on coronavirus relief vaccines than ever before, given the rapidly rising number of omicron vaccines.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been late January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Omicron variant is an emergency, and vaccine protection needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let's boost now", Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of Omicron were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent.

I'm for everybody to introduce themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation for a conversation came in the mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he comes from, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I've got five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious shortcoming in sales.
How else can a cushion damage occur after nine months ?
I'm just trying to get on the PRS.
But it 's been working for about a year .
Not for 14 days.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought six PRS_ORG#, but I wanted to buy eight.
But there were none.
Now they're available again and I want you to add two chairs to order and charge me for that.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I'm going to write a little bit more about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) am more likely to come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One of the things that really bugs me about this, and unfortunately happens all too often, is that many victims don't let themselves be helped or think we can't help them.
I'm very clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with the perpetrator far beyond my sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the social environment, fear of pulling the kids out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is that some of it is very close to tears, that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it's never going to be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What makes the series League of Legends?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a breathtaking display: "Arcane", the series from the League of Legends computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball league: Derby debut of the MHP Giesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster John Patrick was reliant.
For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But it did not settle after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball League.
And more than the naked result, the way he performed was disappointing.
The statistics that represent the whole dilemma are representative: the three-point ratio was just 13%, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) on 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded: "We simply did not concentrate enough after the Tenerife victory and did not implement what we had trained".
I mean, move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "Winning a wild game for the second time against Ludwigsburg", said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people".
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they were paid.
Not least, BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team in the game.
"The best player I've ever coached", Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the line.
Only in the final quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and reached eight points after already laying 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there's not much time left to comb.
Already on Wednesday (19 a.m.) the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have re-examined the legal situation and have written to them about it.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Always like a chicken out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He can inspire his audience with new interpretations of 20s and 30s drums.
He's on the road with the "Good morning, good luck" program now - if he can do it.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it doesn't turn out to be anything.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled, as stated on the singer's website, which is now 59 years old, and his musician's website (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will want to repeat their 2020 deadlines, which were already postponed due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962, in Lunen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe enjoyed singing a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with his fellow musicians.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of drums and songs in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the MTV Unplugged series (2019) reached the second spot of the charts - just like his hit album "For Women It's No Problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair combed back tightly and with a mind for etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be forgotten in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020.

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"A foreclosure does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the structure of the owner", Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies, for example, is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left wants to set up an expert committee on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz has not ruled out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further tightening of the lease.
The Coalition Agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation on rental increases in tense housing markets and an extension of the rental level.
I'll talk to the Attorney General to get this done as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
In the face of a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the United States caused severe devastation and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storms leave a roughly 200-mile [320 km] stretch of devastation, especially in Kentucky.
Which Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado hit, it was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just get out.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates that Kentucky alone has up to 100 deaths, and the official numbers are increasing every hour.
Hey, I just saw she sold out the #NAME# showcase.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?

If the delivery can't be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was received or edited, since I had not yet received an authorization.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the German government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees cash premiums for the vaccination.
They are in line with the social partners of the OCTs and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The German model of advertising campaigns to call for vaccinations is also designed to increase the readiness for coronavirus vaccinations.

You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you back then, well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Cancel the call, please.
That would be legally relevant.

Help for your first campaign
Boron to the grass!
I'm currently leading the Adventure Over the Grape Pass for a group of four friends and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically designed for the players.
We 're playing DSA 5.
The big arch has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual files devised, and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes will bring a truckload of grain of rye to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That's where the next thing is gonna happen.
A few miles from the village, the hero is to raid a group of goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, detecting the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
If you don't notice, the goblins will attack the hero in a hollow and flank three arches to the left and right of me, the chariot armed, while two with spears stop the chariot.
If there's a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the village school boy, a half.
The cart is gone, of course.
If defeat is inevitable, this same half with two of his servants comes in to help the hero in battle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of solution 2 is?
Is the Encounter too much to begin the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll take a lot of your ideas to heart and I'll have more faith in my narrative now.
I've disassembled the lamp again.
And then they're back together.

I 'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1 .
Hello, F1 fans, the quality of German Sky has been declining over the years, so I'm going to take a breath of fresh air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race to get the F1 preview reporting started on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident had left the schedule far behind, the final ten minutes and the championship decision could still have been shown.
But it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore must limit everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has moved the race to the final.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was a lack of knowledge of the rules again among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they both didn't know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, they both decided that the tyre change was only allowed when Hamilton was given radio contact on the subject.
Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that there was a possibility for the transfer.
I think that such basic rules should be known when you're commenting on F1 on a pay TV station.
It is also not the first riddle guess which is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about rules.
I don't like Roos's fancy commentary style, but admit it's a matter of taste.
But I'm serious about that, I even like Heiko Water better than RTL.
There are also constant nonsense that makes both seem unprofessional, like ordering coffee from (also unconvincing) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD".
The latter in particular is causing a great deal of unrest in the comment, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-up to the race Sky is the only broadcaster to go into the advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to go out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing this.
And these two channels are also less advertising in training than Sky, which is a free-to-air TV station.
I'm sure you'd like to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn't make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language station to broadcast F1.
Ironically, RTL is doing a better job of advertising the four races they're still allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the grand F1 season is far less fun than it would be with a sensible broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
Here's the one: #PRS_ORG# flashlights, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it's still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it's going to be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she's going to check and send an email and she never answered.
Hi, I ordered two PRS-ORGs on 12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via aerial lift.
We offer this series in three variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can see the performance comparison there.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, depending on the model of fan pump, but they also offer to give an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that turns the air bubbles into a function.
This would be a treasure chest, shell or something.
The MK series has a special soundproof design, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet, etc. by means of a 4/6 mm air gap and can start.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan is lower than the water level, a retractor valve should be placed between the two.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards, the water from the pool running through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, as are other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that use little energy
Even if we say three days here on eBay, we're packing every day and we're picking up every day here.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to be a little more careful so that no one gets upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like, not everyone has understanding for all the staff who work in the shipping industry too... of course, this is not where Corona stops.
Please do not immediately judge poorly, just because the delivery is delayed, which is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to talk about these services, even if we say right now, which are fucking hard.
This is also very different in the region.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the Blue Origin company's New Shepard rocket system by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The flight, which took about ten minutes to land, took place in the western U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-credited astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the founder of Amazon.
According to Blue Origin, the flight took 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew to space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, who had four other passengers pay for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Dick Evan, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin wouldn't tell us how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He's been working hard on his assignments and doing everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He'd rather go back to space right away, the host said.
New Shepard is flying at 100 kilometers.
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with no gravity, before the reusable object was restrained by large parachutes.
The International Civil Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third all-crew trip: on the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was 90 year old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy director Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject itself quite exciting and I am not bothered by the lab (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry internship).
I have, of course, been informed about my career prospects before I went to university, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely like to study and will.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially the prospects for my career.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you hear about great job opportunities and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
So I 'd really like to know:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/what did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers.
I'm really unsure right now, and I'm thinking about maybe dropping out of college in 2022 and getting a degree in computer science.
If you have any experience , she likes to write .
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
So, just a post for that now.
Not just before big holidays like Christmas, we have a lot of stress in the office.
Looks like there's one before the holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week, Mary went to heaven, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses have a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So, last week, we had a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
All those emails that had to come out before the trip, order here, order there, everything before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "Next week then" sounds like so much time and it can't be?
Or is it because people are serious about doing as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was also very nervous.
What's this holiday hostage thing?
What good are we to have holidays if we cannot properly enjoy them?
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all totally self-sufficient.
My question is simple: are we the only Swiss like this?
Is this our Reformed evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringia home - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The beautiful thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can go to Ilmenau in the Thuringia forest", said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She'll be attending the party by backing out and babbling with her son.
"I love this", said Catterfield.
But until the days of reflection, she has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, I have to go now".
NEKTON-Bio supports smooth movement of the mice and the formation of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the damage caused by poultry farming is due solely to malnutrition.
Since the feather is made of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather garment.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the mice are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient vitamin and mineral supply.
The composition of NEKTON-BIO explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavourable amino acid ratio in most plant-based feed.
No further vitamin preparation should be given during the administration of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or through soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Unfortunately , it still doesn 't work .
DDR-hand-working model Oldbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy goods train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesia network, possibly also from the small companies ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are up and running
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to propose an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains on this route at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the supply of 1Co+Co1 locomotives with a gearbox drive to AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens shockworks with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 0106.
All survived World War II and afterward found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The workmanship of all six locomotives was established at the Dessau railway improvement plant.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network became increasingly necessary for heavy-duty locomotives, the three locomotives E 9501 to E 95 03 were upgraded in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts.
The first was the larger E 04, E 44 and E 94 units.
It was only when the E 94 was seen that the number of processing operations could not be increased further that the E 95s entered the processing operation.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at Leipzig-Wahren railway works.
They came to the railway works at Halle P. in 1960.
They were used in their own routing plan, mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complexity of the locomotives proved problematic as they grew older.
It's been a long time since the gunmen have been caught in a carpet.
Then the man who was constantly riding on this locomotive with a hammer and wooden sling had to unlock the gun during the ride.
The damage to the engines occurred frequently and led to months of locomotive failures.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of electricity was planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most splitters, and the E 95 was discontinued.
In addition, they noted that the German Reichsbahn only wanted to operate electric locomotives for men, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the management.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to be withdrawn from service on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives except for E 95 02 have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a road heating system at Halle Central Station to replace the future E 77 10 museum locomotive.
It took some time for the Reichsbahn to convince the E 95 to be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the exterior work of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a show at RAW Dessau.
The engine was designed by the German architect J. J. Kramer, and was built by the German architect J. J. Kramer.
In 1986 the locomotives were completed internally.
The DB Museum Hall (Saale) is the museum of the locomotive.
Since 1995, the traditional community of Bw Halle P has been working on the operation of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, where the transformers were inspected and five drive engines are operational.
-The locomotives were in service until 1945 on the Schleswig Mountains Railway and the subsequent sideways, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, functioning well, it is necessary to rework optical work on the premises in its own work, dusted, with game tracks, cellar odor !!!, very rare handwork model, very small printing- perhaps the construction equipment also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet... unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do now?
I can't make the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended hold.
So I'm getting new ones sent in.
When will they be sent?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the mounting manual the right ones by the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose.
They 're not flat with me .
Could I have these sent?
Hey, #NAME#, can I explain the problem again?
Home fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated amount of damage was caused in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent dwelling in Kinsau (Landsberg on the Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume that it was a deliberate setback.
The Kripo Princefields breach has taken over the further investigation.
But it comes much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To discourage fake news, Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on social network LinkedIn in early 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Shaahin said.
Uğur Şahin, CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, has released a photo showing him getting a coronavirus vaccine.
There was a lot of misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine", Shaahin wrote in a LinkedIn post on Friday.
"For months now, friends have been pressuring me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors".
So far, he's refused to do so because the communication wasn't supposed to be about him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine was fighting for his life.
He's been battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahine continued.
He didn't ask me why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and distrust".
Fear is hard to combat with facts, so sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with German Wave circulated on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself explained.
"I am not currently allowed by law to get the vaccine myself", Shaahin said at the time.
In Germany, the vaccination of the vaccine is a priority.
The priority has long since been abandoned and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times, according to his own data.
Fire in a power plant: Tens of thousands without power
In several communes in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a power station.
After a fire at a power station caused serious damage, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia have been left without power for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire caused the lights to go out in some communities among 41,000 people affected.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power units were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be fully fixed late at night.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caretaker thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire department and the THW for their tireless efforts", said the head of the Primary Technology Department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The damage will take several days to be repaired, he explained, as some lines were only temporarily restored to operation by the Westnetz installers.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
The current is flowing again
The fire, which broke out at about 7.15pm on Friday, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt power plant at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There are many elaborate cleaning and repair jobs.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6pm, more than 21,000 people have had electricity in Much and Ruppichteroth.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on as of 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m. the last ones affected by the power outage have also had power.
Over 80 assemblers from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
The authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighbourhoods and inform local fire departments if help is needed", said Councilman Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus of the installation and operation of emergency power generators was on the inhabitants of nursing homes.
In addition, authorities have said that temporary care centres have been set up in schools for people who could not care for themselves or who need electrical medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
- Good afternoon.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
It's the daytime #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't put this on the tabletop.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted the ones with the table plates of #NUMBER# diameter.
We got a diameter of 155 centimeters.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it in and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I'd have to send it back, because otherwise it's not fit for purpose.
I 'd be happy to hear back .
Yeah, that's really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Can you e-mail me the return card?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
However, before I bought it, I had not restarted the e-PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost unashamed.
We disagree with that.
Nordic combined: combiner rider wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have been on the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to beat out the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber once again, who had already started with a great lead after ski jumping into the Loipe.
Return the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yeah, we both re-engineered it and we're using version 4.5...
Maybe they've heard of it before.
I bought a book right away with my PRS_ORG, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty. Report to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To ensure that the painting is uniform and clean, clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, and rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before you first apply the brush with a new paint to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly alongside the brush.
The slight overlap of the colour layers later provides a uniform surface.
Avoid swiftly wiping the brush back and forth.
This creates surfaces that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metallic glands may occur when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you put them in.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or drawings.
From the license plates on aircraft to ship names to the decoration plates and license plates on car models, the decals give the model the ultimate cut.
Bring the decals in the correct order while the components are still well reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily attached to the fuselage before it is fitted.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, pincers, and toothpicks are time, patience, and a calm hand when clamping.
Cut out every decal you need and straighten it out.
Decals are also called water-slip images because you're moisturizing their backs with water for a short time until the paper becomes dark from the wet.
Then you just push the image a little bit of paper and put the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you've moistened before).
While you're holding the Decal on the model with a tool, you're pulling the carrier paper away from the side.
Warning: Always check that the picture is in the correct position before completely moving it off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, crack or even tear.
Drain excess water with a household knife.
Respect not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, and once I look for something else, I stop reading the book and I have to log out and sign in and re-load the book and look for the place as far as I've read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
All three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three packs.
Okay, thank you very much.
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
But will I get that back without any problems?
Child welfare treatment in the event of an accident / What is an 'insurance case'?
Hello, together,
We've been in childbirth treatment for a while, but now that we're talking about the bill with the car, it suddenly turns upside down.
The next thing you know:
We had applied for the child wishes grant in advance at the car and got the commitment for three tries.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt directly resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we did two (unsuccessful) trials, but they still didn't count on the car.
We again applied for the cost of the vehicle and were granted three more tests.
After several more attempts (we have done more than promised, the most expensive cars are logically expected to pay for the car), we received the bills from the car and were surprised: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the car wants to return only 3 attempts.
The reason: pregnancy/birth terminates the other two attempts at the first commitment.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
The CETA states that "the insurance case begins with the cure, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists".
The questions to the experts in this round:
* Who has the right here, the car (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (it is 5 attempts to be refunded)?
* Should the car have been obliged to tell us in the pledges that the further attempts would be lost with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (which is caused by a closed urethra) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help.
Could you please email me the three options and tell me the best way to get back to them?
I'll be right back.
We're not ordering anything else from them.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME#, you obviously lost a good customer.
You're welcome to pass that on to your manager.
It's not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was ordered and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it if the dresser comes in completely messed up.
Please see what the colleague wrote on the screenshot
It's clear and clear that the refund was initiated and I still haven't received any refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you've lost two regulars.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not doing that anymore.
No, the defect didn't occur until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
The guarantee shall be valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I'll be able to take the cabinet down and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional hooks to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them in your shop.
Can you help?
Topics of the week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there's no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
The Internet provides a wealth of lists of low-budget films, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what might not be pleasing to you?
I'm a very good customer of yours, I've already furnished two apartments with your furniture.
I was going to ask you the best price for the grey leather sofa odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it reliable now?
Thank you very much .
With a friendly greeting
There's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
- What 's up ?
'Half victory' against Belarus is associated with high EU costs
The EU can declare a "half-win" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This pending state - Belarus is not contributing very little, but the EU feels as a winner - will probably go on for a while.
Bossong said that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
It appears that there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
The EU as a whole is not firmly opposed to this, and this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development is also weakening cohesion in the Union.
"It is obviously impossible to enforce a policy if a Member State is willing to do its thing", as Poland is doing now, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: "A basic agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult as the line 'Border protection, border protection, border protection' has been strengthened".
Re-try to cross the border
According to Polish border guards, migrants have tried to enter Polish territory through Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned by migrants in the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was shot in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler in Minsk for lureing them into the EU with the prospect of joining.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have been relegating border crossings.
The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
EU Commissioners also travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
Bossong said the most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on airlines.
"The EU has put its market power on the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account internal costs.
I think that the Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to lock down thousands of people regularly through the country.
Mercedes protesting after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two violations of the rules during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial Formula One final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed a complaint.
The Silver Arrows are suspecting two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is allegedly related to a violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car phase, which he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the rating at the end of the race.
In the view of Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had still overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the final round and was awarded his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars ahead of him.
I'll check that out.
I 'll talk to the bank and report back to you .
Thank you for your support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park stadium of the Sportclub Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
The park said that members and permanent ticket holders of the Breisgau sports club and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The train trains that day flashed through the red and white shirts.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect setting", the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park showed once again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this", says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is this a number and not the original 1699 ?

I had a huge problem with you when I ordered the PRS_ORG dresser.
Judith Hermann was reading from her novel "Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" series, author Judith Hermann read her latest novel "Home" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and is attentive to the nightly sounds on her doorstep.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I didn't get an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your cluttered chat and mis-delivered billigator from China.
Your mistake, which you fix, and not everyone in our household.
Please contact Mrs. NAME.
I can't chat with them every day.
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. NAME would get an email with a 60 euro voucher, a re-order of the PRS_ORG night table and a return label.
This e-mail hasn't come in yet.
The package is to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like a lowlife saying he has nothing against foreigners.
I'm not going to admit it either.
But colleague is constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it alone.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as unimportant as colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions the basic nature of evolution is simply completely lost.
I'm the reason a god started this.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just making a mess of nonsense.
And you 're an enemy of science , not taking it seriously like your colleague .
To maintain optimal vision, the lens should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The lens system, designed in a special aplanatic-achromatic way, allows you to use the lens practically without recording and color errors all the way to the edge.
Often, lupus is marked with magnification.
However, these data are only applicable to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, please note the instructions in the table 'Technical data' (see Package Manual).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including those with impact loops, light reflections are produced.
An antireflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
If the optimum conditions of use are met - a magnifying glass close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For more information, see the accompanying instructions (in German and English).

Tinn sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are selecting the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has been through some strange situations when selling tin.
Once a man is said to have gone home without his partner, because they could not agree.
He plants 2,000 trees a year.
The 56-year-old has been through some strange situations.
He says that makes the Christmas season a little fun.
What about the voucher?
Or am I going away as a customer?
I got a defective delivery and now I'm paying the full price.
I'll be evaluating that as well.
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating tip.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound so good.
Problems with the fibres + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network right now.
I used a DSL 50 Mbit connection before and I used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox is also coming.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wifi, no longer reaches the full 500 but the further away I am in the house with the module, the less it reaches (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
This means that the new fiber-optic Internet connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (~45 Mbits).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why fiber optic can "lose" so much Internet speed via the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to move LAN cables into the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to have an answer.
When is the time to change the current account
Whoever thought that the Giro-Counts were quiet now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to try to get past fee increases confirmed by their customers with all sorts of tricks, the negative interest rate exemptions continue to fall.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous at a limit of EUR 100 000.
Now she's cut the allowance in half and even cut it in four for the day's pay.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group branch Postbank - to EUR 50,000 for current and investment accounts and to EUR 25,000 for daily money accounts.
However, these lower exemptions now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman at the request.
This is not only for new contracts but also for 'new individual agreements with existing customers'.
Commerzbank had previously fallen to a limit of EUR 50,000, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
DKB, a direct bank popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free-standing amounts in two stages, first to €50,000, and now to €25,000.
After all, according to the Verivox Internet portal, more than 100 banks now have a free-standing amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached a level of EUR 25,000, but there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have been granted a right to appeal against this scheme in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are now discussing whether institutions should make reservations - in the event that the higher courts also declare negative interest rates in principle unacceptable and have to pay back many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire army of beauty
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain trip and a valley trip.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For the group, who made a name for themselves in 2021 with the reunion of Friends and the continuation of their series The Morning Show, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
She's got an army of assistants, stylists, and coaches who care about her looks.
After all, according to Aniston, she indulges herself in one chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip out of the bag).
That she's still flying the hearts of female and male fans equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with the luck and still looking for the big love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that question have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope success and fame make you happy.
Dishonorable end of a career:
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula One went even slower than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a car accident and a slight band-bang, Raikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after half the distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife, Minttu, and their two children had also left for the United Arab Emirates.
Reichkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times from pole and reached the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the two-bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I've calculated that once, I'd have to win nine and a half times a season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
He only defended against John Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, when he went from third to first.
Then he changed the material setting a little bit and took a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall) he stood up to the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded", said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd series win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was riding for Stuttgart, had previously finished in second place this time, coming in fifth.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race and eighth.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way", said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
In the women's game, Laura Nolte won her third straight double-header in her home country.
After finishing fourth in the Monobobob the day before, she ran for the World Cup with the German triple-winning Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-time Olympian Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt of Burghausen.
She won her first podium finish this winter, alongside her Olympic qualification.
Weed swimmer Kim Kalicki and Leonie Febig finished third.
For me, it was super cool, first place in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama's taking me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just a push, but there's also a tremendous amount of work to do".
Jamanka was a little upset about the not-so-flawless drives, but he said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and I can't redeem it, so I finally asked.
I had a lot of problems with Corona last year and I never had time for it.
And now he said he was gone, which really pissed me off.
Look in the chat it went around the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it's just reduced:)
Why isn't the shipment launched until March 16th?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, not until I tip it off.
Was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered merchandise.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new, undamaged
And not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, dear lovely girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I want to write down, and maybe one or the other will go like this.
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, I'm a full-time student and a dog mom -- aside from my dog not yelling or going to kindergarten, he's actually my child by one.
My boyfriend (since 6J) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I went to see him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we had a lot of cheering and it was nice.
I helped him shower because his hand is in the burn bandage.
He's cold on top of that and we're seeing less of each other now (1-2 times a week), which makes me very satisfied with my needs for affection and love.
My dog just got a stomachache, I cooked for him, and now he's lying in his cuddle blanket and he's relaxed a little bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
We're also getting some housework, which we're naturally sharing.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is now quite well adjusted, I'm halfway well treated and I'm going to be fine.
Not good, but I'm getting better and almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot of questions right now, and tomorrow at 3:00 I have a written test I haven't done yet, and the day after tomorrow, an anatomy class I should at least prepare a little bit for.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So my week goes like this: just until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, it's all going on?
Just until my birthday.
Just until the holidays.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm gonna get caught up.
I feel guilty and "chaotic" somehow, but I can't do it otherwise...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm so grateful I don't have to work.
I'm really grateful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBs otherwise.
I think it's partly related to the mental load of women, so I thought I'd find some suffering partners here...
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
The first delivery was the same color as the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're gonna change the table now, I'll get another color or something?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26.
The rest twice.
But it hasn't been confirmed.
I'm going to say something completely different: I noticed at school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and that for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
I always found this a little strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it in some way.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell of your work- and study-related colleagues who have different attitudes.
I understand the difference between personal and professional life and it makes sense to separate.
There's a curriculum, and so on.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What then makes one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
You want to preserve culture or something?
I hope your question isn't too private.
Can't change it or can't? Write in English, I understand that well.
It's been a long time, I'd give it up.
- It's all right, thank you.
I expect a response early next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search for a movie , please .
Hey, people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (at 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
There are two time zones (or parallel worlds) in the film.
One is the modern world.
Secondly, the past (or the realm of the dead) is not entirely certain.
I can't describe it any more, so in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to live for herself.
I think the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, the two soldiers fight against each other.
If that's any of your business, I'm grateful for any answers.
Our baby has been sleeping on her stomach since week one.
Fast forward: still alive:D
- Relax, please.
A child like that can take much longer than you think.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddling animals, come in and watch more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy.
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something be lifted from the belly?
Or is it facing forward right in the mattress?
That's how you can tell if everything's okay.
We've all grown up, too, and when my husband was born, it was a big deal to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We're already your regular customer and have bought a lot of items.
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'm asking you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is not in use at this time.
Let me be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
It's just that the politics of this station are in a mess.
Almost every format is sponsored, but then we're going on a big begging tour at the same time.
They said you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "You don't want to be a running bedside column".
What's the matter now?
A 0815 commercial broadcaster trying to get his Billo Merch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A crook who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How do you get all this right?
I love it when you like it. I think it's terrible.
I'm requesting a recall because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corruption caused by a modest delivery of the PRS_ORG#.
Whether it's a comfort for stomach aches or just for cuddling, my little warm friend is versatile.
Cherry pillows are a traditional home remedy for heating applications, as cherries can absorb heat very well and release it back in doses.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft touch makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not doing so well.
The reference cherry pillow is suitable as a heat source only for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odor, stains or burns and, if present, dispose of it immediately.
Please remove the inner heating pillow from the frame first.
In the microwave heating at 300 watts maximum for 2 minutes maximum (please note the microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking.
Then put the inner pillow in the frame.
The first heating can produce a slight moisture formation on the surface but disappears when repeatedly applied.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy performance can cause damage (flamming and combustion hazard!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of cereal products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated pillow has been put back into the frame, please check the temperature of the pillow for baby suitability (max. 43 °C) at your armrest!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fever-related conditions, circulatory disorders, fresh haematoma, bleeding and open wounds, or in people with reduced pain.
If you have any existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour disease or you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using it.
If seams have opened and loose cores have leaked, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in infants under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the product's care symbols.
Darmstadt after Hinserie II - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football League.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 is working from the cellar.
Ingolstadt won't be able to do it under the third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim trainer Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful arrival under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged through my power supply.
I bought this new about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power alone was enough to run the business.
The battery is empty and the laptop won't start even if the power is plugged in.
I've been working on the battery, but nothing's going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you so much for your help.
I want the delivery of the PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the PRS_ORG chair.
I don't know how high the seat is.
You're on tour often, and yet you're equipped?
With the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 litres of capacity also allows larger photo equipment to be absorbed without problems, which can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold partitions.
And what else you need for everyday objects, thanks to practical access, stays well organized and detached from the camera equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the Everyday Line's update to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The stylish, minimalist design has literally taken on a life of its own - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that can safeguard the interior of the backpack reliably while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works in two ways: once conventional, through the lid valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch shutter, a highly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger bags.
The locking valve shall contain a metal locking handle with appropriate anchorages on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has introduced different "filler" ends: there are 4 anchor beams, which are fixed and can be used to insert the closing shake.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top bar, it's more like empty, a deeper one.
The valve and hook are also magnetic.
This also allows the backpack to be securely closed without the hook being attached.
The second feature also sets the Everyday backpack apart from other photorecord bags: besides the lid, there is a riveting opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to scroll through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday fitness of the backpack, since you can not only take your photographic equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more below) and easily store both apart - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main case, while keeping the everyday items in the left half of the backpack safe and not getting in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when it goes to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I'm waiting in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the order of the
Contact of the shipping company to pick up the table incorrectly delivered.

I'm asking for an immediate settlement.
I'm writing now with the third support staff, and I've never been more than a promise to get a confirmation email.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Is there any way to tell when the closet could be returned?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you very much for the help
I wish you another good evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered with a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I'll place a larger order, but I kept the damaged piece and didn't send it back.
And that last year went differently than I thought, I couldn't imagine, and I just couldn't get it out in time and clear it up.
But I'm a customer and I won't accept the damage.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shiny debris in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called California Gold Rush of 49.
Thousands came from far and near, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were set aside, tents set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called: Coloma or Bust (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you're a pioneer who's looking for wealth in the West and making a name for himself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, gathering horses and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You have to choose your actions at the same time, you have to keep your resources at home and you have to build a table that works more and more for you  so-called Engine Building).
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, get extra promotions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can use fine adjustments to develop your individual style of play.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Then their choice is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a blockade!
This will disable half the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternate to take action, such as gaining resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all operations are completed, the pioneers will return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available promotions.
This goes on until the valuer moves five times, so once covers every location, and the year ends.
There's a shooting game where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough to the heroes of the revolver and are more than the bandits in numbers, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third round of the shoot-out, and then the final score is drawn.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediaathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation popped up on my Twitter timeline today, and I was looking at it right away.
>Children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated parenting debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are thinking and acting differently now.
Our parents and other responsible people must never, ever, ever have power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discussing the elimination of tripling testing
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of tripling testing.
"We need urgent clarity on whether and when three vaccines can be exempted from the test requirement", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, in the "Sunday picture".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is "not only medically sound, but also provides an additional vaccine boost", Holetschek said.
The German Federal Minister for Health, Karl Lauterbach (SPD), has promised to 'make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday.'
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hi, I think the PRS_ORG chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't make any more purchases through my PRS.
Advertisement: Ups, there's been an error.
Shopping is done on the PRS_ORG website on the computer.
I've updated the account details.
What could this be about?
What you're describing is called "awareness", meaning sensory perceptions under total anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common causes are hearing sounds/voices, seeing images less often and perceiving pain less often.
Relevant to this topic: cesarean section is an operation that involves increased awareness, as a way to protect the child from a very deep anesthesia until the time of the navel.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the narcotics interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me is correct in describing Awareness, but by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
I'm afraid the 20 euros won't help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the faulty chair.
This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard for e-commerce.
Please check again to see if they can at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an email, and you didn't answer.
I'm asking you again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is #NAME#.
I just called the station.
I was told they only deliver at the door because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that right?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry my heavy furniture to the first floor.
I'm not gonna call you?
I had a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died aged 97
He's made a name for himself as a theater critic and a curator.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, printed fresh: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell from the world that theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led to April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book is, "I'm here to show my gratitude for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardised wooden pallets, used mainly in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The value of production was about 79 million euros.
Number of pallets imported into Austria per year is not charged
New York is taking the MLS Championship for the first time.
New York City FC won the title for the first time in Major League Soccer.
After a 1-1 draw against the Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in the 11m hurdles, 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rollout Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect gloss a week ago.
It was Christmas and it was delicious and delicious!
So thank you again for that .
Now that I've gotten the taste, I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund for that.
Do you have any tips for me, by the way?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
How are we doing now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my PRS_ORG?
My English is not so good, but I'm getting it.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by mail on January 18th that the refund had been made.
But to this day, I haven't received the money.
Would you check that out?
Where there are still Christmas browns in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas foods, like the pine tree and gifts.
You haven't gotten any chicken yet?
Time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas bread in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a pipe end contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers allow you to adjust the desired level and the fragmentation of your sounds.
The VT+ series amplifiers also offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
Upstairs, it sounded like you could even float a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator if it was loud.
Power level controllers allow the VT+ series to be used in all situations.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an excellent "acoustic" sound when using a headset or direct recording.
The AUX box can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favorite songs.
There's also a tuner feature on board, so you don't need a separate voice device.
In addition, if you have a VFS5 foot button, you can easily use your foot to play the sounds, turn on/off the effects blocks and tap the speed of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking a step further into the future!
I'd have seen it like that with others.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
Because she's too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the dresser?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hey, have you ever sat in the PRS_ORG chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy to get a bequest or a voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit of a lot.
I just got my delivery and I was wondering if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The Iranian authorities have said that progress is being made in the negotiations on the resumption of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda", Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a 'positive and important development' because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a nearly week-long interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - now the state with the highest incidence of corona
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
The only federal state with a value above 1000.
Thuringia is the only federal state to have surpassed the mark of 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 residents.
In Saxony, which had the highest incidence in the whole of Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but also had been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported in one day.
200 seriously ill people with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'm writing you.
I'd like to take the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a shame in my eyes.
It's time for change.
I am in the plenary in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Why the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the last few months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not existent.
We've gotten into a winter storm and we've extended the summer hole for a few months.
# Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this is probably simply because of the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone down here and how we stand in general.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many of us here are really still bocking at the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is being asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who has been aware of this project in recent days and has found a pile of debris, to put it simply.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves eager to rebuild the project.
I would like to expressly call once again on everyone to take part, only if this project can continue in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server where we can exchange information and work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How are we going to behave outside in the future?
* How are new members to be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a lot, but that's not bad, because we ended up having a disagreement.
If you have the will and time, come to the disagreement, work with us, and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered an umbrella from you for that, which will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big for this and not suitable for my taste.
I already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and then I noticed this when I took the soft foam.
I'm very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day deck #PRS_ORG#, is there one in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I don't have the right packaging, but I'll disassemble the closet as much as possible for pick-up - they need to use #PRS_ORG# to figure out how this works.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you're vegan?
I had a conversation today with a colleague I like.
She herself has been a vegetarian for a while, and she rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned interim, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and realized that I would ultimately support animal cruelty.
That's why I decided to become vegan.
At the time, I had the impression that her disgust had come up, and she defended vegetarianism, saying she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarianism was a way to reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too plump?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like a vegan is getting put in a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on.
It welcomes a harmonious vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an exception under Section 312d of the BGB.
Your PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I'm on the date assigned when #PRS_ORG# won't pick up my return on the spot.
I'm sorry, but I can't be there for a funeral.
Can you please assign me an alternative pick-up date?
From February 1st, I'll be back in touch.
The construction of the Lahnstein water rescue depot: EUR 45,000 grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz delivered a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment car of the Volunteer Fire Department Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in service since November 2020 amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this", says Peter Labonte, mayor of Lahnstein.
The equipment car is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform water and ice rescue and technical assistance tasks.
The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel and the continued increase in the use of the river as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations, but I synced, removed and re-loaded the app, and it didn't work.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole thing has cost me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order three items from the #PRS_ORG# collection by June.
Can I set an appointment during the ordering process?

Thank you for putting this whole thing on the table. I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, which means we were also gun owners in the executive branch.
I think the question of right and left is always very simplified.
But basically, we should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum rather than the revolutionary left, which should be obvious to everyone.
That, of course, even in the special uniform and armor people on the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then naturally have a hard time dealing with the reality of life is obvious, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated female clichés, because there are fewer to no such things in the executive branch but quite normal men and women who you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or put this for you.
But even these marginal groups, although it seems strange to me from my experience, are representative of a conservative attitude, that is, proud of Germany and feel less taken advantage of by exaggerated leftist policies, even if they are supposed to be advocating or feeling that they must do something right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, as police and the military are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that threaten the state is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even police and soldiers who have been deployed abroad often start to make public their negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-minded people may meet at times and exchange ideas vigorously.
I think that this is a good fight, and that political education and enlightenment are also used to counteract it.
Germany is so deeply embroiled in international affairs and that is good, I think, that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, I ordered the other basket from the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But I was so confirmed in your order confirmation
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany.
I always think of you as a partner.
But up on the edge of the wood part are two deep cones filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More decent through childhood?
Hi, I've been busy with one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (on my own, very little free time), but I have been more than happy to keep my household clean and tidy all my life.
There are always stages where everything stays in place, and then every now and then it packs me up and I clean up.
But it's never really like someone could come to visit spontaneously.
My husband is not (unfortunately) any better, but it does bother me somewhere, but most of the time he just loses his household to work and misery.
The kitchen is cleaned even more regularly because we like to cook.
Now, to my question, have you managed to become more decent with a child?
We haven't worked on any yet, and I've been busy with this question for a long time.
Because I don't have any incentive for it, I just don't mind it so much as there's no visitors and there's always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further stamping on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on the arms and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arms and knees)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and step provide a perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back-breaking seal and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and applying the equipment to the surface.
The free flex zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a heat-resistant, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face of the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft, collared zone improves sealing with fine adjustable width shifting by a flexible, gentle seal that does not stick to casing or seams
Double-ply, with a riveting seal on the arms and legs, connecting a retractable inner sleeve with a soft castrated neoprene outer sleeve
45° Inheritance at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and strain resistance when wearing.
Long neck-closure with elastic reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased overall comfort without housing
Long G-Lock P back-breaking seal (all without housing) with metal slide and built-in water dam system for improved sealing (Buchat patent)
The following paragraphs shall be added to the list of the following paragraphs:
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the clutches to prevent a tear if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels, with outer and inner overlap
The edges of the outer sleeves are lined for greater load-bearing capacity
The edges of the inner sleeves curved for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially at deeper diving (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I've been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem is, I have an insecure (or fearfully avoiding) personality disorder (PTSD).
That means, roughly speaking, that I have no sense of self-worth and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a practical level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I seem impractical (which I think has improved).
Can I be a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual workday is really what I imagine it is, and it's hard to find anything about it on the Internet.
The EPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time I object to something in my code ("the simplest things are already screwed up") and it is difficult for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should really know how this works by now"/"I keep him off work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I am less qualified" etc.).
I'm probably going to have problems in every profession but I wish I'd mentioned it right away.
You got the couch back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for a pick-up appointment.
What do you mean , please return ?
When I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes out your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein absorbed from the food breaks down the bird's stomach and intestines into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feeding.
The formation of feathers in nestling and the formation of feathers in the mouse bird are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be given during breeding as there may be disturbances in the gross course of the animal.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One coloured measuring spoon (in) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In severe feather damage, the initial dose of NEKTON-Bio can be doubled or tripled until the feather regeneration approach is visible.
After this, the normal dose is administered until the complete feather remodeling is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after nine months ?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you get this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in opposition to the Statute
Hello, legal service German,
I have this problem.
We're going to cut down a walnut tree on our property.
So, you filed a lawsuit with the city.
An employee writes to me that the falling of fruit trees and hence walnuts is not part of the charter.
The statute, however, explicitly states that walnut is a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's testimony now or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging they've got for it.
I haven't received a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa that's not used.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so. The only question is, yes, can I pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany?
Can you check that?
Emergency report: serious accident at Selb
Recently a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plößberg junction.
As the press alert to the police reports today (14:03), a car has entered the traffic at the time of the overtaking.
There are wounded.
Ah, okay, I see.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy.
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you first!
My Christmas is moderately good, unfortunately, because my dear head is thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I endure here, I need advice, and best of all, advice from people who know my situation, so you know.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-country skier.
I was originally studying something else and working in a field (to remain anonymous, at least, I won't say anything more specific).
But then I was too bored with it and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
I ended up at the school and I was sure it was -- even though the framework was much more inflexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on the third "I'm going to google other job openings".
And it's only been six months.
I've always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing.
But I'm absolutely finished right now.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
It's a holiday, but I still have a lot of work to do.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my holiday night was my holiday night.
I had a day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family party is too stressful for me.
And then there's these rigid structures that are also annoying to me.
It's actually fun, and from the outside, the ref is doing well, too, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can handle before it gets completely tight -- if it's not already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old field, where I was valued, where I could take my free time if I needed it, and I did find the work a bit boring, but paid appropriately for it and worked together as a team and not as a single fighter like this is most of the time.
But then I wonder if I'm not back at the same place in a year and dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you have some outside advice or ideas like me coming out of this situation, that I'm completely done and I'm almost crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not gonna make decisions emotionally right now, which probably won't do me any good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and excuse my crying tone.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been continuously evolving, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the valve reactor circuit, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we're introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifiers, VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amplifiers also naturally contain the multi-stage valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply understand the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system from which natural resonance is only sparked.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and the effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a further performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the VT20+ handheld to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series is designed to provide a variety of sounds for all guitar players.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and string strings, and a quick speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner , Magic loses to the Clippers
The Orlando Magic's NBA losing streak is on.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main feature is also adaptable: with three individually playable and foldable folding parts, it is fully adapted to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible feature would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various Sony A7 series models or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
Plus, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for things that are not photographic.
Drone pilots also make the Everyday 20L backpack an ideal choice, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption at La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused extensive damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the eruption on La Palma since Sunday has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the Tehuya volcano eruption of 1585 was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
While the activity of the still unnamed Cumbre Vieja volcano has declined somewhat in recent days, volcanologists have continued to be unable to predict when it may end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable", said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to state broadcaster RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential buildings and other structures, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
That's almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landscapes, some 50 hectares in size, were created by cold lava off the coast.
The banana farming industry, which is of great importance to the island, was particularly affected, with about half of the 85,000 inhabitants living directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, reported El País.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is coming and especially the children will be looking forward to the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crunching tension something tempting in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas gift-giving tradition so that the gift-giving gesture, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be re-filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas to the gifting of gifts.
Before, gifts were given in one way or another on Christmas Day.
The reason for this tradition, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows in one night to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional gift-giving resulted in the custom in Germany of filling boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants were opposed to this practice because they rejected mediators between God and man as "sacred worship".
For these reasons they are defending themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the Christian child, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details as such, it is only a minority who are upset that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the use of martins with martins singing and martins' costume, is still a fixed part of the Christmas season.
Today, in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches, you can find everything your heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a cheerful crush on the question of who is bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Holy Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his slit, which is drawn by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy, the Witch Befana is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fairy tales bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
It's not reindeer here, it's three horses that pull their sleds as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Hussite Reformation, the Christian child is responsible for the gift handing.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and bookstore with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle, which officials said could be stopped shortly after.
There were shots fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is easily set up and can be anchored to the ground with 2 earth springs.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time maximum 10 hours.
- The robust plastic finish can be used all year round in the outdoor environment.
In Hollywood shows, it's mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color.
Smart Stone is harmless: the sun alone makes this sunlight shine with fascination  in either white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment  whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock bay.
He also does well in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and findings, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of pre-work: As a solar lamp, Smart Stone doesn't need wiring or batteries.
Place the lampstone in any sun-drenched place during the day.
Two consignments of soil salts provide a stable holding if necessary.
The matte-white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides Smart Stone discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs  one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the case.
At dusk, Smart Stone starts to glow spontaneously; in which color, you decide for yourself: you have six attractive light colors to choose from  besides daylight white.
The switch off is also automatically performed once the battery charge level has been reduced to a set minimum or it is back up.
Once the sun shines again, the charge cycle starts from the front the next day.
I've done this several times. It doesn't work.

The problem with the pills
Hello, my dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year, reddit is actually my first post.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, and I started taking it again because I had so much pain during my period and I had so much fucking PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to let that go again, because I'm already taking enough medication for chronic illness that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 on my last two-year break and these everywhere.
It was superficial, but I was pretty stressed out and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years we've been on break, it's never really been normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this one.
I'm already a perfume-free, non-geddin cosmetic, but maybe someone can recommend something.
I'm sorry, but my gynecologist didn't take me that seriously, and my dermatologist appointment is coming up.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
Yeah, the cute skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatism, then a period of rest, then extensive knot-fighting and the acne issue.
I have also tried everything I could during my illness and have been addicted to sugar, milk and low-fat meat because nothing else worked so well.
It may be good that hormones are just the worm in it, but if you have construction sites like me everywhere, you'd rather not go looking for anything else that goes wrong.
I already had all her colleague's seminars.
I wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what my question was answered.
I have to work and I have to talk on the phone and then all of a sudden everything is gone...
What's there to check? If the money were there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank records, maybe something was wrong.
But there is generally a large

In the name of the people: Laity pass judgments
In the courtroom, they're sitting in everyday clothes on the bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Creators and professional judges determine whether and how long someone is behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "unreal" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.

110 kV ground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation to lay the new high voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The decision to set the plan by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now informed us of this.
The seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the parish and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a free-flowing mast near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning, please.
My order of 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only been received in part.
The blue bet-sell number: #PRS_ORG# with the transmission number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the indication "Not possible to deliver".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week.
You can forget that, I already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass dressing room and the entire sides are blown up, so there's glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS_ORG# regulations
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all the books, so the #PRS_ORG# request, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Teaching plans (EC)
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his report.
I've been in the ref since summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I still have a lot of problems planning my geography class in a timely manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy for free at school (which is annoying for geologists).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes right now.
For example, we're currently working on geofactors, and I'm actually looking at every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to spend too much time on simple lessons (I do need them for UBs, etc.).
I always start with the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra, and I'm rather dissatisfied with most of the assignments in the book.
So are the worksheets.
Maybe I could get a geology teacher to teach me how to work with the book efficiently.
I'd really like that.
I'd like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I've actually decided to get a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I'd love to get back to work as soon as possible.
The trade is worried about the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Most businesses only allow those who have been vaccinated or cured.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue breaches.
He has a possible solution.
The 2G rules are, from the view of the German Trade Association (HDE), destroying the important Christmas business of retail.
The Commission has also taken note of the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the aid.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of businesses had a negative view of the rest of the year.
Many would have already cancelled the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil", said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's only good in grocery retail and online.
The Association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe business, the CEO said.
"2G shopping is not going to help us fight the pandemic", he stressed.
The current rules discouraged customers and required high levels of staffing.
The banding regulation must be approved nationally, he demanded.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked on 2G once (vaccinated or recovered) and has access to all stores on that day with the tape received.
In addition, in retail, as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), sampling should be sufficient.
The German real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were just below the pre-coronavirus level, with the sales at around 90 percent, last time without 2G.
These figures will now fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business", said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
The high personnel and administrative costs are making efforts to find solutions and get approval for the Centre.
This includes the so-called tape solution, where 'visitors, for example, at a central location in the centre, once submit their 2G credentials and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops without interference'.
I just ordered and got the PRS_ORG# delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame is also a bug that was attempted to be hidden with a yellow filler.
This looks awful.
I'd like to return the mirror and have already wrapped it back in the package and pasted it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is its simplicity and intuitive handling.
The lamp produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flimmer-free.
The 120 degree radiation angle that allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively short distances is excellent.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working on set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the lamp to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the lamp is installed in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, which consists of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in kelvins.
Furthermore, the NP-F battery slot is located there (not included in the supply range)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage space, one of the memory keys is simply pressed and finished by longer presses.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Battery operation One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries are sufficiently powerful - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery packs a value in the two displays (the left battery display at the top, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with electricity continuously through the supplied power supply.
The lighthouse is very simple to set up.
They have a 16mm housing attached to the frame so that you can attach it directly to your photo stand.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of determiners on both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and therefore also designed for longevity and hard work.
In addition, a tendon is included in the supply range.
The bulk of the packaging includes a bag.
This allows you to safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got that gift and it's too small:
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a scoreless comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two-time champions of the series, Hessen, were reportedly on their way to the next Bundesliga playoff.
But then the SGE turned on, within a good hour, the frustration of a full season start was burning from the soul and it won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "simple compliment, to everyone who was involved".
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission is not in a position to take any further steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the implementation of the programme.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusens 2-0.
What happened next impressed the SGE trainer too.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance", Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Also, defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to get back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of play and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly high", said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the audience.
That's the party we were planning to throw today.
Glasner wants to keep the focus on the tasks ahead, but is also well-positioned to do so in terms of the staff situation.
It's extraordinary that we're all playing well in December, that all the players are physically in top form.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live highly professional lives, too.
Now they wanted to "go on step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (Sky) on Wednesday.
I'm getting the mail that my package is coming back to you because of a mistake I made.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and getting it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me directly, or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
I would say, unfortunately, that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat in the PRS_ORG chairs?
Dumpster for women's handball before the quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slipped after the humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and their eyes staring from the park.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB team finished with a heavy defeat in front of 800 spectators at 16:32 (8:13) in Granollers and must now face hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent", said head coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second to the Danes in Group III with 8:2 points (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
It was a bad game, by all means, that we have to delete", Captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, a significant uptick against the 2019 World Cup runners-up will have to be made next Tuesday to keep the soft dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German pitcher in a duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backfield player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor defense", admitted backsider Xenia Smits, demanding: "We must look ahead now".
From front to back not at the height
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the upswing.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 draw after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal came after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-offensive.
However, this was not the initial inflammation that was expected.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand up - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the Scandinavian women's gate.
The game was played at 3:10 p.m. and was 20 minutes early, especially as back-up Mia Zschocke was still red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
But she's back in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and by the break at least five goals were scored.
The quiet hope of a hunting party after the shift was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Green defenders sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-positioned opponent who is among the final medalists.
As a result, the German team could no longer cope with an increase in performance and went off the grid as a clear loser.

Do they have that?
The title says I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since most of these are soon done, some of them go to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they relate to a personal one (e.g. "I take medication X, it is compatible with vaccination..").
My task is to provide information on vaccination, the indications (a person is eligible for a vaccine under the Corona Vaccine Ordinance and there are no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (which I have never had before).
The vaccination itself is delegatable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have no, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for vaccine preparation who cannot (maybe?), so I do most vaccinations myself.
The question of the 'Huidlerer' is difficult: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent by an Amberger, has been used to make a lot of thought in the British television programme "We in Bavaria".
However, unlike many days before, the term "host mi?" was not used by callers.
No, it wasn't "man who's nervous".
And neither does anyone who "has to go fast".
That, people heard from the TV host, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg told us about the solution, and it probably surprised many upper-coaters.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a cloth that someone uses to wipe out the oven".
This was confirmed by the dialectologist Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years.
Noting that this is a typical super-fake term, it is somehow derived from the more familiar word for "hoods".
This closed an educational gap - probably even among many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any more books in two weeks.
Once you confirm, you always get the following error message: Oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Is the tire selection really that safe for women?
This morning I woke up full of activity because I wanted to train a little more to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I was riding my race bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice too - but then what happened was what happens in every downtown (this time: Thank you Krefeld!)
Glass splits on the track.
Zack, the loud whistling and my rear tyre didn't want to be on the rest of the track at all.
Because of the weekday, I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and a spare hose, so I had to turn around halfway in a bad mood and take the first train home.
If it wasn't so bad technically, maybe it'd be better if I rehearsed the tyre change before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
I am not sure if I can make this problem happen again or not.
It was not so bad, since the old tyres were still from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had broken down 120 km the day I came to pick up the bike at 2pm!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years.
But when I think about driving 80 to 90 kilometers, I have to change tyres again, I think I'm in a really bad mood:D
Now I've met an older man at the station who asked me, wondering why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires, which are supposed to be flat.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really that indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40 euros a tyre right now, only to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering, I think I'm on the race bike right now, 25x622.
Although there are (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, most are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to a race bike on other tyres?
The swallow side seems to me absolute!
Thank you in advance for your help and my best regards.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would be re-launched.
SOLO 15 is the new sprossling and visually resembles the large prototypes with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this proposal includes a suitable foot designed to lift the speaker to the correct position.
This does not affect the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the home's conditions in the long run.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a rather minor role but an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing almost unfiltered levels of sound pressure that large.
But that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is considerably mature and, for its size, extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal was adjusted to SOLO 15 with a slight increase in pitch.
This is common in broadband to optimize the high frequency bands that are increasing sharply.
The SOLO 15 is designed to be very responsive to the listening area and is very clear and fine.
If the sound is slightly outward, the high pitch range can be reduced and the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the dot source, the positioning of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM, which are suspected of being of reference, provide for a dynamic that is not the same as its predecessor.
The SOLO 15 not only supplements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our building materials, it is advisable to think about the final optics of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for changes in the construction.
For example, if the housing is to be tuned, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer is again carrying material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), an 8 mm hole should first be drilled into the floor plate at the appropriate location to allow the cable to be easily carried there later.
The front speaker is now opened with a loudspeaker, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
This opening should be provided with a 45° phase on the rear to make the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screws of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in Figure Detail Phase.
Then you start the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now lined up.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The materials themselves can vary in strength if necessary, for example if you want to use finished sheet metal from the construction market instead of making it yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to install the second side.
Then all the plates of the foot, the two sides, and the front, follow.
A suitable circular saw or wood drill will facilitate the installation of the bass reflex tube openings and the connecting clamp on the rear wall.
Then a round mill is used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the floor can also be rounded.
The floor plate is then securely glued to the bottom of the case and is additionally screw-in with long wooden screws.
The following is the indication and fore-drilling (2,5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connecting clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking/ blowing), the cable is laid.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and left standing about 30 cm.
The cable is placed in the upper part of the housing to the speaker opening and is also loosely suspended.
The frequency softener is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switches and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document:
If the frequency softener is installed and the connection terminal is screw-in, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet fully closed, shall be sealed.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can have hot glue dripped on the opening and close it.
The opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and a small lamp allow the seal to be checked accordingly.
Now, the description of the sedation.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so the plus-line (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus-pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube shall be shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of pipe).
For the purpose of dampening, a mat of the dampening material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the case.
The opening around the bass reflex should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we are going to host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, we cannot get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There'll be at least three people per slot, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least seven beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, and yet we're gonna do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It'll start at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
