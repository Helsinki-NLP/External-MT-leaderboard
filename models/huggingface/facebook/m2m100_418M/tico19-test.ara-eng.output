The rapidly growing cumulative number of coronavirus (Kovid-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, which confirms that although the phase varies according to the country, the COVID-19 disease is rapidly worsening in all countries.
According to Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and centralized care units should increase their preparation to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, concentred care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens were in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that the causing factor, the new coronavirus, is now referred to as the coronavirus 2 associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-KOV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of individuals with Covid-19 have a mild disease; that is, they have a respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 infections have exacerbated to a more severe disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% have a serious disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to Covid-19 was around 4%.
In this study, we evaluate the accumulated number of KF19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them with those of HB, China.
We also compare the current number of Covid-19 cases in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK
After what happened in China, Covid-19 was increasingly geographically spread and followed the dynamics of Covid-19 in the rest of the world now the dynamic state.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Kovid-19 as a disease.
In the Eurosorphelines number released on March 5, 2020, Spiteri and others the first European Covid-19 cases confirmed according to the World Health Organization’s definition of the condition.
In the EU/European Economic Area, the first three cases confirmed by France were on 24 January 2020 of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, Covid-19 cases were discovered in all countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (UK), as between December 31, 2019 and this date, 39,768 cases were, 1,727 cases were, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 cases in Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and the cumulative rate of cases of Covid-19
In the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of Covid-19 cases in each country around the world is updated, which is only obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health agencies and the World Health Organization, every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to evaluate and compare the COVID-19 trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK with those in Italy.
As a measurement for the spread of active cases for Covid-19, we calculated the accumulated number of Covid-19 cases intermitted in 14 days, and then taken into account the natural path of Covid-19, in all countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also announced that the number of reports from each country on March 15, 2020 at 8:00 p.m., with a comparison of the number in Italy during the period of March 31, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK
The trend of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases cut over the period of 14 days in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom of the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1) was followed.
For the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase on 21 February, then sharply increased on 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases by Italy, but all EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK showed similar growth trends to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK compared to Italy for the period between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It is highlighted that as of March 15 at 8:00 p.m., 15 other countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom the total number of cases already similar to those in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings show that the number of COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
The remarkable trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the disease is worsening at the same speed in all countries.
This although the countries are in different stages, despite the different national public health responses, the possibility of differences in state definitions in the different countries and protocols to select the patients to be submitted to the test to confirm their infection with Covid-19, including the follow-up test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where 10% of Covid-19 patients needed intensive care, and media sources that hospitals and concentrated care units in those areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitals and/or concentration care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at the EU/European Economic Area level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not presented).
However, they must be collected in a systematic way to complete current monitoring data focused on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive care and middle care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for concentrated care and average care per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
The modeling scenarios related to the satisfaction of the health care capacity, with estimates for each country of the EU/European Economic Area and the UK for the spread of Covid-19 cases that have entered the hospital associated with the risk &gt; 90% to exceed the capacity of the concentrated care beds, are available in the sixth update for the Covid-19-related rapid risk assessment at the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since cases that have been collected so far in certain regions of the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, and hospitals and centralized care units usually serve specific regional population groups, it is preferable to provide information about cases and centralized care beds at the level of regional units for statistics 2 (NTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the Covid-19 hunger is rapidly worsening in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and concentrated care units should prepare themselves for the sustainable community transition scenario of SARS-COV-2 and increasing the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially concentrated care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
According to what is shown in the Fast Risk Assessment of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the comprehensive Fast Prognostic Approach is the key to delaying SARS-COV-2’s spread with the transition from the Conclusion to the Relief Approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly in case they are not implemented in advance.
The Fast Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to alleviate the impact of the wound.
There is a limited opportunity during which countries can increase their supervisory efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, health care systems in other EU countries/European Economic Area are likely to face an increase in the number of patients who need focused care over the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (Covid-19) explosion, caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), caused more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 injuries in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a human catastrophe.
The SARS-COV-2 virus, similar to the SARS-COV virus, which caused thousands of people to get SARS in 2003, can also be transmitted from the bacteria and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
Nevertheless, Covid-19 has a lower risk rate and deaths than Sars, but it is more transitional and influential between older people than young people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications related to the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will discuss the foundations related to the epidemic of the disease, its causes, its viral science, its diagnosis, its treatment, and the prognosis of the course of the disease, and its prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help understand and eliminate the disease that is a threat.
The spring festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who have been encouraged to stay in their homes throughout the holidays and many weeks after it due to a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) which caused the eruption of SARS in 2003; then, the World Health Organization (WHO) named SARS-COV-2 on 11 February 2020, the disease associated with COV-19 (COV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused 80,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with more than 40,000 patients removed from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization has warned that Covid-19 is “the number one public enemy” and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research on Covid-19 has been published, including the virology of the disease, its epidemic, its causes, its diagnosis, and its treatment, since the first report released on January 7, 2020 that identified the sequence of the isolated virus through many patients.
This review aims to summarize the research progress in the new topic that is rapidly developing.
As far as possible, we will seek to compare Covid-19 with Sars and another disease caused by Cov, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers, a 2012 explosion).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some urgent questions that are still being raised.
Corona viruses are commonly considered to be a non-mortal cause of diseases in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the four common colds.
Nevertheless, in this century we met coronavirus caused severe diseases in humans twice, SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV, which originally caused the disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and soon the disease spread to many other countries with a terrible rate of spread and deaths.
Therefore, the current Covid-19 is the third-largest coronavirus eruption in the recorded human history.
As described in Figure 1.1 , the unknown-born lung inflammation groups were first by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Committee.
Seven days later, a coronavirus series was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan the first death case.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection cases were among healthcare providers, indicating the possibility of the disease being transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed with all public transportation closed.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease that among the confirmed 41 patients, only 21 were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which was considered the site of the beginning of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic as a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2)
As the situation develops rapidly, the final scope of the explosion and its seriousness must still be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric study conducted on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients who were confirmed with Covid-19 presented a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-KOV-2 affected people from all ages, but it affected the ages of 30 to 65 primarily.
Moreover, the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 47, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll was approximately 4, and the number of people affected by the death toll.
SARS-KOV-2 affected the number of men (0.31/100,000) greater than women (0.27/100,000).
Covid-19 expands among groups in Hubei and around them primarily.
Covid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start of the infection to the diagnosis.
The average childhood period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of infection from its beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The Basic Multiplication Number (Basic Multiplication Number) is 3.77 (Confidence Area is 95%: 3.51-4.05) and the Basic Multiplication Number (Basic Multiplication Number) is 2.23-482.
The number of injured people increased sadly before 23 January 2020, in line with the numerous trips before the Spring Festival in China.
The number of deaths among patients confirmed was 1.44% (the confidence range is 95:1.86%) and the amendment of deaths among patients was 3.06% (the confidence range is 95:2.59%).
The three main risk factors for Covid-19 were gender (man), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a series of large and covered viruses containing a genome of rebozy nucleic acid of the single line that triggers the trend.
It can be divided into four races, Alpha, Beta, Gama and Delta, and it is known that the coronavirus of Alpha and Beta infects humans.
The covered shell (S) of the sugar protein is linked to its cell receptors, the enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and the bipedase 4 (DB4) to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, respectively, then the membrane integration occurs.
The viral-ribozy DNA genome is released into cytoplasma; after the reproduction of the viral genome, the genome-ribozy DNA forms, accompanied by the sugar coat proteins and the chicken-core proteins, vironate-containing cells, which are integrated with the plasma membrane to release the virus later.
The first genome series for Sars-Kov-2 was on 10 January 2020.
SARS-KOV-2 is a new type of beta-KOV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% among the 10 sequential samples collected from the original site of the explosion, the Huanan Seafood Market Bohan.
SARS-KOV-2 is more similar to SARS-KOV than MERS-KOV.
Through the electronic microscopic transition examination it was revealed that SARS-KOV-2 is found in very thin parts of the appearance of human airflow.
It has been revealed that the human enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 is the future of SARS-KOV-2 as well as SARS-KOV.
However, S-protein from SARS-COV-2 is linked to the human enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 a weaker link than SARS-COV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes less severe infection in SARS-COV patients.
SARS-COV-2 can also make up an orf3b encrypted short, renewed protein and orf8 encrypted extracted protein.
Orf3b in SARS-COV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenic capacity and limit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have any range or pattern that has a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Chu and others the full length structure of the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 under the ultra-cold 2.9 Å microscope in a compound with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They discovered that the compound, which had an open and closed structure, was accumulated to form a demar and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind a protein S, providing evidence of the corona virus and infection.
The sodium-based neutral amino acid carrier may become a therapeutic target for the drug testing for CPS-COV-2 infection.
The original host and intermediate host.
It is known that both Sars-Kov and Mars-Kov have grown up from the pineapple and transmitted to humans through Yogurt and Beauty, respectively.
By comparing the cellular evolution of SARS-COV-2 with other coronavirus, the coronavirus was considered the original host of SARS-COV-2, with the new coronavirus 96% matching the coronavirus, the coronavirus is similar to the coronavirus and they are called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Nevertheless, the mediator who helped the virus cross the barriers between the factions to infect humans remains unknown, and the path of the transition is not yet explained.
J and others suggested the serpent as a carrier of the virus from the spider to humans, which involved a similar re-installation within the protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that Harshvian Mormons - a long-language mammal that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of SARS-KOV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity of the corona virus found in Harshvian Mormons and SARS-KOV-2.
Nevertheless, the difference of 1% spread along the genome remains a big difference; therefore, we look forward to decisive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The chemical characteristics of SARS-KOV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 ° C and a moisture between 40% and 50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-COV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 ° C for 30 minutes; Ethereum, Ethanol with a 75% concentration, chlorine-containing purificators, acetate, chlorophorm, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexide, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity against SARS-COV-2, so they are more likely to get infected with the renewed virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study of the immune response to SARS-KOV-2.
So, we can only refer to previous studies related to other coronavirus, Sars-Kov, and Mers-Kov (Figure 4) .
In general, after the host virus invades, it is recognized by the natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRS), including catine-like type C receptors, TLR-like future receptors, Neo-clitide-related receptors, and RIG-I-like future receptors.
Through various pathways, the virus triggers the appearance of inflammatory factors, the maturity of the thyroid cells, the installation of type I (IFNs) interferons that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large bacterial cells of antiviral antibodies.
However, the N protein in SARS-COV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adjusted immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
The thyroid lymph cells, including the thyroid cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in defense.
The CD4+ cell stimulates the bacterial cells to produce an anti-virus body, and the CD8+ cell kills the virus-infected cells directly.
Tactical cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokins to help the defensive cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce the function of the cell cell by encouraging the programmed death of the cell cell.
Mixed immunity, including completed proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, the isolated antibodies of the MERS-COV patient were recovered.
On the other hand, the excessive reaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst chance, multiple organs failure and death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, which originally appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women more likely.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are damaged are more likely to get infected than others.
The average estimated duration of Sars-Kov-2 is 1-14 days, or between 3 and 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted on 1,099 cases revealed that the infancy period was 3 days and between 0 and 24 days.
A recent study, as shown above, showed that the infancy period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities modify the effective health stone time based on the most accurate duration and then prevent people infected but without any symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people who are exposed to the virus or who are infected with it are usually required to undergo the health stone for 14 days.
Should the health stone time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial manifestation of Covid-19, and may not be accompanied by any symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, breathing discomfort, muscle pain, vomiting, headache, throat inflammation, nasal turmoil, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered from breathing difficulties and/or blood oxidation deficiency one week after the disease began.
In severe cases, the patient’s condition evolved rapidly to have severe respiratory syndrome, intramuscular trauma, metabolic acid, and bacterial disorder.
Patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be examined, even without a picture that reveals the presence of lungs disorders, in search of the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing difficulties, and 3% for diarrhea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were in two recent studies of a group of families and a group of people who had transmitted the infection from a person with no symptoms.
Compared, a 2012 demographic study showed that Mers-Kov patients also suffered from fever (98%) and dry cough (47%) and breathing disorder (55%) as major symptoms.
Nevertheless, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than Covid-19 patients and were consistent with the mortality rate of Covid-19.
Diarrhea (at 26%) and throat inflammation (at 21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was revealed that all of the symptoms (99% to 100%) and the dry cough (29% to 75%) and respiratory disorders (40% to 42%) and diarrhea (20-25%) are the most important symptoms, and it was necessary to provide respiratory support to approximately 14% of patients.
By February 14, the rate of deaths due to Covid-19 was 2% while confirmed cases were 66.576 worldwide.
In comparison, the rate of deaths due to SARS by November 2002 reached 10% of the confirmed cases of 8,096.
For Mers, the mortality rate was 37% of the confirmed 2,494 cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study that the Basic Reproduction Number of SARS-KOV-2 was high at 6.47 with a trust range of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while the Basic Reproduction Number of SARS-KOV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison between Sars-Kov-2 and Sars-Kov and Sars-Kov in terms of their symptoms, mortality rates, and basic reproduction numbers shown in Table1.1.
The above figures indicate that Sars-Kov-2 has a greater spread capacity than Mars-Kov and Sars-Kov, but it is less young than the latter.
Therefore, control of the SARS-KOV-2 epidemic is much more difficult than control of the SARS-KOV and SARS-KOV epidemic.
The beginning of the disease in the collections often occurs in the same family or from the same collections or the same vehicle, such as a shipping ship.
Patients often have a date relating to traveling to or residing in Wuhan or other affected areas, or interfering with persons or patients within the last two weeks before the disease occurs.
However, people have been to be able to carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients who have left the hospitals can carry the virus again, sending a warning to increase the time of health stone.
Patients have a normal or low number of ocean white blood cells (especially lymphatic cells) in the early stages.
For example, Lymphic deficiency with the number of white blood cells &lt; 4×109/l, including the number of lymphic cells &lt; 1×109/l, and high levels of the carrier of Amine Aspartate and Blood Viruses were discovered in 1,099 patients with Covid-19.
The levels of liver, muscle and mucoglobin in the blood of some patients have increased, the reactive protein C has increased and the rate of red blood cells in the blood of most patients has increased.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of demer D increased, resulting from the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, and the number of lymphatic cells gradually decreased.
Disorders in radiation imaging appear in most Covid-19 patients and are characterized by double placebo shadows or the blindness of a scratched glass in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have an unstandard pneumonia, severe lungs injury, and severe respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
When the syndrome of severe respiratory disorder occurs, the out-of-control inflammation, the accumulation of fluids, and the propelled fibres are strongly affected by the gas exchange.
Disfunction of the type 1 and type 2 lungs cells reduces the level of the surface steroid and increases the surface stress, and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to spread and increases the risk of lungs collapse.
Therefore, the worst outcomes of radiation of the chest are often compared with the maximum extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of Covid-19 showed the pulmonary cells, the formation of the helium membrane, the fatal lymph scratch, and the multi-core cell in the lungs of a patient who died due to the disease, in line with the pathology of the viral infection and the severe respiratory disorder syndrome and similar to what happens to patients with SARS and MERS.
Robotic DNA detection of SARS-COV-2 may be used through the sequential reverse polymer reaction (BT-BCR) as a key standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative effects, which may accelerate the epidemic, the use of clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RT-BCR) began in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and radiation discoveries is essential and essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol for the use of Cherlock-based Chrysler technology to discover Sars-Kov-2 and discovers a piece of Robotic DNA created by Sars-Kov-2 at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mm / l to 200 × 10-18 mm / l (10-100 copies per microleter of the input) using a mixture in less than an hour without the need for precise devices.
We hope that the new technology will improve sensitivity and fitness significantly if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with regard to the new coronavirus, doctors can provide mainly supporting care for Covid-19 patients while trying a variety of treatments used or previously proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral medications, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and anti-virus vaccines.
SARS-COV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also, and in a less degree, attacks other organs that emit the angiotensin-2 enzyme, such as the digestive system, the intestine and the kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and failure are the most dangerous threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to relieving symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-smalled respiratory systems, and artificial respiratory systems, based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by out-of-body membrane oxidation (ECM), a pulmonary cardiovascular pulmonary technology used in the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition,ining fluid balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and intravenous trauma, and protecting the function of the vital organs, is also essential for SARS-COV-2 patients.
It is known that the cytocin storm is produced by an excessive reaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The Setoquin Storm is a form of a regular inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of Setoquinates including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines encourage immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals, which is the main cause of severe respiratory disorder and multiple organ failure.
Immunocept is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially in severe cases of patients.
The steroid hormones, tocelizomab, and single-sile anti-interlucin body 6 were used to treat the cytocin storm.
Other immunodeficiency treatments for the cytocin storm include the adjustment of the cell-oriented immune reaction; the blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the inhibition of Janus Kinaz; and Plinathumab; the captain of the cytocin signals 4; and the Histon Dissetilis inhibitors.
Steroids and immune captives have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses were not beneficial with severe lungs in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it may cause severe side symptoms, especially an endocrine bone marrow, which strongly affects the prognosis of the course of the disease.
However, it was recommended to use short cycles of stimulating hormones in doses between small and medium with caution for critical cases of Covid-19 patients.
At the time of writing this report, no anti-virus treatment was confirmed to be effective.
Nevertheless, it was discovered that giving Remedicifer, a newclitidic counterpart, was effective with an American Covid-19 patient.
Remedicifer is a new anti-virus developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remedicifer also showed a potential inhibition of other single-chain rebozy nucleic acid viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these viruses, the Composite Guillad provided China to conduct some tests on individuals with SARS-KOV-2 and the results are highly observed.
In addition, Paricetin, Interferon-Alfa, Lupinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin were prescribed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other reverse reactions may occur after the combined treatment of Blobinavir/Ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of healing patients and the production of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients recovered from a disease is intended to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from having a long history of disease.
In fact, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the sick factor in their blood.
Anticorps are an immune globulin (IG), which is produced by the biolymphic cells to fight pathogenic factors and other strangers, and they recognize the unique molecules in the pathogenic factors and directly reverse them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovered from Covid-19 and injected in 10 patients with severe conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation, viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to introduce this method to widespread use before achieving specific treatments.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate an over-stimulating immune reaction and cause cytokin release syndrome, which is likely to be life-threatening toxic.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the isolation of biocells from recovering patients, the determination of the genetic codes that encrypt the active antibodies, or the examination of the active antibodies against the essential viral proteins, is more resolute and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend largely on a set of multiple components in the composition that vary according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or mysterious because they are difficult to extract and verify of these ingredients or their optimal compositions.
Currently, because there is no effective and specific treatment for Covid-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to medium symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Shaw Feng Doo Capsules and Lian Hua King Wen Capsules for the Treatment of Kovid-19 was discovered.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of Covid-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their diseases, including Gansu (63.7%) and Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%) while the Hubei province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of Covid-19 patients in China, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very approximate comparison, with many other influence factors to be included, such as the number of patients and the severity of their condition in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Poly Chang and his working partners published a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with common therapy between Western Medicine and traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the duration needed to recover from high body temperature, symptoms, and hospitalization were much shorter in the Western Medicine + traditional Chinese medicine group compared to the only Western Medicine group.
The most impressive, the rate of symptoms exacerbation (from mild and severe) was much lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine Group compared to the Western Medicine Group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the death rate was lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine Group compared to the Western Medicine Group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more well-considered experiments on greater scales and more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of procedures and explain the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their compounds if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19 often feel a severe fear of a severe infectious and even deadly disease, and people who are subjected to a healthy stone feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, lack of oxidation, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as impotence caused by stimulating hormones, can lead to further anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first stage of SARS eruption, a series of psychic diseases were including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychic excitement, psychological symptoms, harassment, and even suicidal tendencies.
Combination and mandatory health stone tracking, as part of the public health responses to the Covid-19 eruption, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, health stone, and trace their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for Covid-19 patients, suspects of infection, persons interfering with them, as well as people in general who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on SARS-COV-2 eruption and plans for its treatment, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct interference.
Effective vaccines to cut the virus’s transmission chain from deposits of infected animals and humans to exposed hosts are necessary and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
The efforts were made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or preventive immunity against SARS-COV.
Lively vaccinated vaccines have been evaluated in animal patterns for SARS treatment.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the living body of elderly and deadly challenge patterns and prevention of an animal-source viral infection were not determined before a clinical study began.
Per this is because Sars disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been since that time.
On the contrary, the appearance of separate cases and groups of MERS in the Middle East continues and spreads to other areas due to the continued presence of animal sources in the epidemic areas.
MERS vaccination strategies have been developed using an inactive virus, oxygen-reduced ribosic DNA plasmids, viral carriers, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and sub-units of composite protein, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-COV-2 vaccine for non-immunity individuals is an urgent and urgent task to control the current continued epidemic.
Nevertheless, overcoming difficulties is a challenge due to the length of time (an average of 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of the coronavirus.
Covid-19, as a new disease, just began to show its full clinical course over thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishment.
Nevertheless, Covid-19, like Sars and Mers, is also associated with the spread rates of the disease and high deaths in severe cases of patients.
Therefore, building a pattern for the prognosis of disease progress is essential for healthcare agencies to determine their services priorities, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies that have been so far, the following factors may affect or relate to the prognosis of the disease in Covid-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor to determine the prognosis for the course of SARS disease, which also applies to COVID-19.
Age groups between 30 and 65 were mainly affected by Covid-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study conducted on 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of concentrated care were more likely to develop associated diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not need it (the average age of 66 to 51), indicating the age as a predictive factor for the results of Covid-19.
Sex: Sars-Kov-2 affected a larger number of men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Associated diseases and complications: Covid-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart attacks and irregular heart attacks.
Heart attacks were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 may also be linked to positive yellow cells with angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2, which may lead to liver functional disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and disease are strongly linked and may interfere with each other.
Unnatural laboratory results: The level of reactive protein C (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, suggested to be a predictive factor of disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
It also suggested a link between the level of reactive protein C, the severity of Covid-19 disease and the prognosis of its course.
In addition, high Lactate Hydrogen Detox Enzyme (LH), Aspartate Amnesty Transmitter (AST), Alanin Amnesty Transmitter Enzyme (ALT) and Creatine Kinase (CK) may also help forecast the result.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are eliminated during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of functional disorders in the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: Radiation of the chest and gradual progress of clinical symptoms should be taken into account alongside other problems to predict the results and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, the steroids are common immune captors used as an assistant treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of activated hormones are widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered an endocrine bone marrow with lifelong disorders and poor quality of life.
Therefore, low-dose and short-term steroids should be used in Covid-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the Covid-19 eruption, many patients suffered exceptional stress; they often suffered long periods of health stone, severe uncertainty, and witnessed the death of family members and their sick colleagues.
It is necessary to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, Covid-19 seems to have different epidemic characteristics than Sars.
In addition to infection in the lower respiratory system, SARS-COV-2 can effectively regenerate in the upper respiratory system and cause mild symptoms or does not cause any symptoms in the early stages of infection, like other corona viruses that cause common colds.
Thus, patients infected in the early stages or childbirth period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, it is believed that SARS-COV virus transmission occurs when patients are in a severe condition, while most viral transmissions have not occurred in the early stages.
Therefore, the current explosion of the Covid-19 is much harder and harder in terms of control than the SARS explosion.
In China, intense efforts are currently being made, including the closure of Wuhan, surrounding cities, and the continued health stone for almost all inhabitants, hoping to prevent the Sars-Kov-2 transition.
Although these measures have greatly damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the spread will end by March and the decline phase will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, some other experts do not have the same sensation of optimism.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that Covid-19, which seems much more infectious than Sars, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model for prediction of the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that Sars-Kov-2 could affect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-KOV-2 was discovered in the middle and throat screws of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the newly discovered virus could become a periodic influenza-like attack.
However, promising signs have appeared in China based on the number of new cases taking down, which indicates that current strategies might have been beneficial.
It was initially expected to cause up to a million cases of Ebola, with half a million deaths.
Nevertheless, the disease was eventually controlled by following strict health stone measures and isolation.
It is possible, like Sars-Kov, that Sars-Kov-2 becomes weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappears or becomes a less infectious virus that lives with humans.
Below is a comparison of Pope Kovid-19 Pope Sars and Mers below (Figure 55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through cough or swelling, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with viral contaminated substances.
The virus was also found in the outskirts, which triggers a new possibility of transition from the outskirts to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases that 41% of cases were likely to be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, considerable precautions are needed to protect humans, healthcare providers, social professionals, family members, colleagues, and even passengers who have communicated with patients or people injured.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical and respiratory N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent a potential person from moving through the air or attaching to the surfaces of the material, where it can be passed to others.
Nevertheless, only N95 (Series No. 1860s) can protect from the inhalation of small virions as much as 10 to 80 nanometers, with only 5% virions able to complete the inhalation; Sars-Kov-2 is similar to Sars-Kov in size and the size of each is approximately 85 nanometers.
Since particles can interfere with up to five combined surgical masks, healthcare providers who interfere directly with patients should wear N95 (Series No. 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, healthcare providers should wear an adequate isolation cloth to reduce the contact with the virus more.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician in Basar-Kov-2 was injured despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus could enter his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face protectors or glasses while working with patients.
For the general people in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with detergent soap more than usual, try to stay at home for self-health stone and reduce communication with people who are likely to be affected.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 came into the human world as a new virus, its severe similarity to SARS-COV as on 7 January 2020 would have caused a high-ranking state in China based on its deep memory of the SARS in 2003.
However, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center has not been convinced by the citizens until January 19, 2020 that the new virus has a low infection rate and a limited spread from person to person and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly reduced the public alert, especially when the whole state was preparing for the spring festival, losing a critical time to contain the disease at its lowest scale in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may benefit from this harsh lesson and carry out substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to confident the public; (4) more effective and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test the system of response to society and improve it periodically.
The Covid-19 explosion caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months it spread throughout China and around 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing these lines.
Since the virus is very similar to Sars-Kov and the symptoms are also similar between Covid-19 and Sars, the Covid-19 eruption has caused a repetitive feeling of Sars infection.
However, there are some prominent differences between Covid-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain epidemic and treat patients.
Covid-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and deaths is also higher in older people than young people.
Sars has a higher mortality rate than Covid-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients transmit the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they’re seriously ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of Covid-19 from SARS.
This partially explains why Sars-Kov-2 spreads much faster and broader than Sars-Kov.
Ordinary Robotic DNA examination for SARS-COV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the virus spread.
With this rapid progress in research on Covid-19, there are still a number of critical issues to be solved, as follows:
Where did the Sars-Kov-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-KOV-2 and the corona corona similarity of SARS in Khovish, we can still not make a conclusion that SARS-KOV-2 comes from Khovish.
Which animal was the medium type that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as the puppy, to humans?
Without knowing the answers on the number 1 and 2, we can’t stop moving efficiently, and the explosion can return at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-COV-2 is linked to the angiotensin-2 converter enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the aerobic cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the triggering cells of the angiotensin 2-transformer enzyme in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick, accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically when it is transmitted among humans?
Will he become hungry worldwide, or will he disappear like Sars, or will he return again periodically like flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and many other questions.
Nevertheless, at any cost it may be required, we have no other option than stop the epidemic as quickly as possible and return our lives to its nature.
Animal resources of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation has led the common development of coronavirus (coronavirus) and its hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human corona viruses (human corona viruses) cause a mild disease, such as zombies.
The eruption of the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed the other face to reveal how dangerous and life-threatening human coronavirus infection could be.
The appearance of SARS KOV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 led to the re-lighting of the coronavirus, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with the ability to cause disease compared to its brother SARS-KOV.
Human coronavirus is an animal disease, so our understanding of the animal origin of human coronavirus will serve us well.
The majority of human corona viruses come from the worms where they were unusual to diseases.
The intermediate storage hosts of some human corona viruses have also been known.
The identification of host animals has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interactive relationship between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important view of the development of the coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human corona viruses, with a focus on the date of their discovery as well as their animal origin and transition between species.
The most important thing is that we compare and interact between the different human corona viruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the reinstallation of the genome.
In this context, we are discussing the disease caused by the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (Covid-19).
In addition, it also emphasizes the successful switching requirements of the host and the impact of the complications of the viral development on the severity of the disease.
Coronavirus (Coronavirus) belongs to the family of coronavirus, which includes a set of covered viruses with a single-chain rebozy nucleic acid that triggers the trend.
These viruses contain the largest genome among the viruses with the ribosite DNA, with a base of 26 to 32 kilograms and the "cora viruses" are called this name because their installation is similar to a corona under the electronic microscope.
In terms of compound properties, corona viruses contain unshared genoms that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains large open reading molecules (ORF1a and ORF1b), converting into multi-copy protein quality pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structuous proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the gene contains open reading patterns for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Cover (E), membrane (M) and Nuclear Protein (N).
Different races of corona viruses also encrypt a number of extra proteins from special races.
Based on the differences in protein series, the Corona Virus is classified into four types (Corona Virus Alpha, Corona Virus Beta, Corona Virus Jama, Corona Virus Delta), including the Corona Virus Beta, which includes most human Corona Virus and is divided into four races (A, B, D).
The evidence of genetic evolution has shown that worms and worms act as a genetic source for most corona alpha viruses and corona beta viruses, while birds are the main warehouse of corona jama viruses and corona delta viruses.
For thousands of years, corona viruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have appeared as causes of serious human diseases.
There are seven human corona viruses (human corona viruses).
The human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-NL63 are part of the coronavirus alfa.
The other five beta corona viruses include human corona virus-OC43, human corona virus-HKU1, corona virus associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-KOV), corona virus associated with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-KOV), and SARS-KOV-2.
The human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-HKU1 and the human coronavirus-NL63 usually cause slight symptoms, such as swelling, diarrhea or both together.
On the contrary, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the newly identified SARS-COV-2 viruses are all significantly causing diseases, causing severe infection of the lower respiratory system to a greater number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing severe respiratory disorder syndrome (sever respiratory disorder syndrome) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
The human coronavirus-229E, the first race B814, was isolated from the nasal emissions of patients with cystitis in the mid-1960s.
A lot of information has since been collected through intensive studies conducted on human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43, which automatically heal their symptoms.
In fact, it was a well-known concept that human coronavirus infection was harmful until the SARS exploded.
The SARS in 2003 is one of the youngest epidemics in our present history, with more than 8,000 people affected, with 10 percent deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has become a constant epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with a divided spread to the rest of the world.
Human Corona Virus 2019 (Human Corona Virus 2019), which has been renamed SARS KOV-2, is the current cause of Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) that killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells and the world is prepared to face the next SARS KOV-2 hurt.
All the seven human corona viruses have animal origin of cattle, mice, or pets.
Several evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human corona viruses are from the pineapple, where viruses are well adapted and malignant but show great genetic diversity.
The Covid-19 epidemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Animal tracking of human corona viruses showed a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors for the movement between species.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the warehouse, broker host, and large-scale host animal (big-scale host animal) of SARS COV-2, with important effects to prevent future consequences.
In this review we provide an overview of animal assets, transition between species, and causing human corona viruses to diseases.
In particular, we light and discuss the common belief that the original coronavirus viruses are usually non-sick in their natural stored hosts but become disease-sick after they are transmitted between species to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the human coronavirus pathway where increased transmission is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of the disease.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS KOV-2 explosion.
Animal corona viruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 race of human coronavirus-229E was first isolated from the nasal emissions of malignant patients, various types of coronavirus were isolated from various infected animals, including rome, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven types of coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discovery in time order (Table 1) will be educational and guidance.
The first race of human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory system for patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966 and then adapted to living in the wi-38 lungs.
Patients with human coronavirus-229E have common symptoms of swelling, including headache, swelling, swelling, throat inflammation, with fever, and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and was subsequently transmitted into the brain of breast-feeding mice.
The clinical characteristics of human coronavirus-OC43 viruses appear to be similar to those caused by human coronavirus-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms of infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nasal viruses.
The human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43 are all spread worldwide and tend to be transmitted during the winter season in a moderate climate.
In general, the time of preservation of these viruses is less than a week, followed by a feeling of disease for two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected with the human corona-229E virus caused a slight swelling.
Only a few patients with immunodeficiency showed severe infection of the lower respiratory system.
SARS, also known as “lantic pneumonia”, is the first well-documented human coronavirus disease that has been caused by SARS-COV, the third human coronavirus that is discovered.
The first accident occurred in late 2002 in the Guangdong province of China.
The SARS epidemic has caused 8,096 confirmed injuries and 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the transmitter of the hyperinfection, one condition of the infection may lead to two secondary cases, with a 4- to 7-day preservation period and the peak of viral load appears on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-COV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, constipation, and hair loss, followed as late symptoms of difficulty breathing, cough and respiratory disorders.
Lymphic deficiency, liver dysfunction, and high creatine kinase are the common laboratory disorders of SARS.
In SARS patients there is also a widespread sinus injury, a multiplication of visual cells, and an increase in the number of pancreatic cells.
About 20-30% of patients then need concentrated care and artificial breathing.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in severe cases, many organs, including the digestive system, the liver and the kidneys, can also be affected and usually accompanied by a cytocin storm that may be fatal especially in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was isolated for the first time from an open pneumonia of a relatives of the first infection case who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, massive efforts have been devoted to conducting research on human coronavirus.
Human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially it was found common in young children, elderly, and immune disorders with respiratory diseases.
Cucumber, conjunctive inflammation, fever, and arthritis are common symptoms of human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described the virus itself being isolated from a sample of the nose of a 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is discovered in the Netherlands, it is widely spread worldwide.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its peak occurring in the early summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with angina throat inflammation, also known as cranberries.
The same year, human coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and arthritis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and epilepsy, human coronavirus-HKU1 has been to be associated with an exacerbation of severe asthma attacks.
Human coronavirus-HKU1 was found to be worldwide widespread, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to human coronavirus-NL63, human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43.
All these four human coronavirus acquired from society adapted well to humans and in general, the likelihood of causing diseases with a low spread rate, however, the accident occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the most vulnerable subtype of human coronavirus-NL63, which has recently been to cause a severe infection of the lower respiratory system in China.
In general, when corona viruses gain this ability to effectively move and keep themselves continuously within humans, they also become less dangerous or ill.
Mirs-Kov was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, it has been in many European countries and in Tunisia of cases from abroad and a rare secondary transition of interceptors to a close personal connection.
Another second explosion in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed injuries.
The clinical symptoms caused by Merce are similar to the symptoms caused by SARS, and are characterized by acute, aggravated pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS also suffered severe kidney failure, which MERS distinguishes from the other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients experience intestinal infectious symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were with a high 34.4% mortality rate, making MERS-COV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
During the period from mid-December to the end of 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia later known as a result of SARS KOV-2 virus were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the current epidemic of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS COV-2 as an emergency state for public health of international importance as called COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in the Hubei region in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS KOV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV, and appears in the form of fever, cough and breathing discomfort.
Diarrhea also occurs in some affected people.
Lung inflammation is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly evolve to acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar due to the high homogeneity in the 82% nucleotide sequence, they belong to different branches of the racial development tree.
SARS KOV-2 seems less severe but is more infectious than SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV.
People have been to have no symptoms despite having SARS COV-2 infection, which may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and contrast between SARS KOV-2 and the other six human corona viruses revealed significant similarities and differences.
First, human corona viruses are similar in childhood and the period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS KOV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six human corona viruses.
Second, the severe symptoms of Covid-19 infection fall between Sars-Kov and the four human corona viruses acquired from society (i.e. human corona viruses-229E, human corona viruses-OC43, human corona viruses-HKU1, and human corona viruses-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS COV-2 is more common in cases of human coronavirus acquired from the community, including the appearance of unidentified or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of Covid-19 can also be seen as in the case of Covid-Cov, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, Sars-Kov-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of both human corona viruses acquired from the community and Sars-Kov.
On the one hand, the transmissionability of SARS KOV-2 is at least higher than the transmissionability of human corona viruses acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains checking whether the transmissibility of SARS KOV-2 decreases after the transition to humans as in cases of SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV.
Finally, SARS KOV-2 can be detected in sputum samples as in other human corona viruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the transition of SARS COV-2 from the oral pathway plays an important role as in the case of SARS COV at least in some cases.
It is worth wondering whether SARS KOV-2 may show seasonal spread as in cases of human corona viruses acquired from the community.
However, SARS COV-2 characteristics, including the possibility of transition, the mechanism of disease and sustainable dispersion after transition to humans will have an impact on the final destiny of the current COVID-19 explosion.
All of the four human corona viruses acquired from the community and causing mild symptoms adapted well to humans.
There is another perspective, which may also be true, that humans have adapted well to these four human corona viruses.
In other words, they may be both the survivors of the ancient human coronavirus.
Human corona viruses that infect people with severe diseases as well as people with severe corona viruses have been eliminated.
In order to do this, human corona viruses must be copied in humans to a sufficient extent that allows the accumulation of adaptative mutations that are faced with host-restricted factors.
Based on this logic, the longer the SARS KOV-2 explosion lasts and the more people are affected, the greater the chance it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it is well adapted, it is difficult to stop its transition between humans through health stone or other anti-infection measures.
The four corona viruses acquired from the community have spread among human collections over many years, causing malaria in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal warehouse.
On the contrary, SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the cause of severe disorder, did not adapt well to humans, and we couldn’t continue to move between humans.
They need to stay and reproduce in their animal warehouses and then look for the right opportunity to move to the most exposed human goals, through one or more medium and large hosts.
SARS KOV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS KOV/MERS KOV and the human corona viruses acquired from the community.
It is very infectious as human corona viruses acquired from society, at least right now.
However, it causes more infection than human corona viruses acquired from society and less than Sars-Kov or Mers-Kov.
It is not yet clear whether they will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or broker animal host or not.
Before discussing the animal assets of human corona viruses, it will be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, storage, mediation, and massive hosts of human corona viruses.
Animal plays the evolutionary host of human coronavirus if the virus has a closely related origin and is widely shared in the level of nucleotide sequence.
Usually the original virus is a well-adjusted adaptation and is not causing disruption to this host.
Similarly, the host store hosts human coronavirus continuously and long.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of human coronavirus or their father virus.
On the contrary, if the human corona virus enters the newly mediated host before or near it attacked humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes disorder.
This mediator can function as an animal source of human infection and it plays the role of an expanding host by allowing the virus to temporarily copy and thus transfer it to humans to expand the scope of infection among humans.
Human coronavirus infection may reach a blocked path if the virus fails to transmit it from the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human corona viruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they can settle it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediary host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS infection had a date of contact with the pet.
The follow-up surveys indicated that animal traders have a higher rate of anti-Sars-Kov IgG spread compared to ordinary people.
For the first time it was identified that Paguma larvata and racon dogs in the livestock markets carry SARS-KOV-like viruses that almost match SARS-KOV.
What indirectly supported this is the fact that no other cases of Sars injury were after killing all yogurt cats in the markets.
However, it has been that the results of the SARS-COV examination in wild or farming wild palm yoghurt without exposure to the markets of living animals were largely negative, indicating that the SARS-COV yoghurt may only be a massive intermediate host, but it is not the natural warehouse of SARS-COV.
It is noted that while 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small breasts also play the role of the massive broker host of the Sars-Kov is not excluded.
It seems that all of these are hosts that don’t move Sars-Kov.
The subsequent research of the natural animal host of Sars-Kov led to the detection of a closely linked coronavirus, which is called the Chinese horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse horse
The result of the SARS-KOV antibody examination in this puppy and the genome sequence of the Chinese puppy puppy virus associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and other coronavirus viruses share the sequence of nucleotides by 88-92% with Sars-Kov.
These studies have found the basis for the new concept that peanut butter adds to emerging human diseases.
Several coronavirus-like viruses (coronavirus-like viruses) were identified from the coronavirus, but none of them could not be isolated as a living virus except WIV1.
The human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (the angiotensin converter enzyme 2) is known as the future of Sars-Kov.
It has been shown that WIV1 extracted from the brush sample was using the angiotensin converter enzyme 2 in brush, yogurt, and humans as a future to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum recovered from the severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equate WIV1.
Until now, the WIV1 virus is the most linked source to SARS-COV in Kharkiv, with a share of 95% of the sequence of nucleotide.
Despite the high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct father of SARS-COV and that the worm is not the direct storage add-on of SARS-COV.
The analysis of the evolution of the Mers-Kov races combines the corona-HKU4 virus group in the Kharkiv and the corona-HKU5 virus in the Kharkiv itself.
Corona-HKU4 virus uses the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host, the same host.
The MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS-COV MERS.
It has not yet been discovered that Mers-Kov lives in the wild.
Merce-Kov and Corona-HKU25 viruses share in their closest cranberries in the sequence of Nucleotide by only 87% .
Therefore, the host spider may not be the direct warehouse of Merce-Kov.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only dark beauty is the positive serum of the Mers-Kov equivalent antibodies, as well as the beauty of the Middle East in many African countries.
The MERS-COV neighborhood, which corresponds to the virus in humans, was isolated from the nose scraps of the only dark beauty, indicating that beauty plays the role of the original host of MERS-COV.
It is also worth noting that slight symptoms appeared generally in Beauty were experimental with Mers-Kov, but a intense viral spread was observed.
The infected beauty widely spread the viruses not only by breathing but also through the oral oral pathway, which is the primary pathway to the virus spread from the scratch.
However, there are still questions because many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with beauty before the symptoms appear, and these cases are logically attributed to the transition from man to man or unknown means of transition including unrecognized species of animals.
SARS KOV-2 Corona Virus RaTG13 is part of the isolated coal coal coal coal coal coal coal coal coal coal coal coal.
The sequence difference between SARS KOV-2 and RATG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the case of SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV.
This means that the worm may not be the host (hosts) direct storage of SARS COV-2 unless the corona viruses of the worm are matched in the future.
SARS COV-2’s intermediate host animals are supposed to be one of the wildlife species sold and killed in the Wuhan Seafood Market, with many primary cases associated with COVID-19, indicating the possibility of transition from animal to human.
Many recent studies based on the metaphoric sequence have suggested that a group of extinction-threatening small mammals, known as Manis javanica, may also contain corona beta viruses associated with Sars Cov-2.
The new coronavirus genomas of these myrtles and SARS KOV-2 share the sequence of nucleotides by 85-92%.
However, they are closely linked to RaTG13 with approximately 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide followers.
The two subsidiaries of SARS KOV-2 viruses are gathered in the development tree of the races, one of them shares the field of future connections similar to SARS KOV-2, with a 97.4 percent amino acid sequence.
In a striking contrast, the receptor connectivity fields for Sars Kov-2 and RaTG13 differ significantly, although the genome sequence is completely similar to higher.
A previous study on eating a patient's arthritis myrtle also revealed the presence of viral living organisms from lung samples, and it turned out that they were equally related to Sars Cov-2.
This study adopted different assembly and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a full-length viral genome by 86.3%.
We can’t exclude the possibility that the myrtle eating is one of the median hosts of Sars Cov-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to argue that Mormons are the direct source of SARS KOV-2 due to the sequence differences between SARS KOV-2 and the corona beta viruses associated with SARS KOV-2 in Mormons Eating.
Additionally, the gap between SARS KOV-2 and RATG13 is less than the gap between SARS KOV-2 and the corona beta viruses associated with SARS KOV-2 in the Eating of Archaeological Mormons.
The evolutionary path of SARS KOV-2 remains in Kefavish, Eating Kefavish Mormons, and other pigs are being appointed.
While the highest sequential similarity was found in the receptor connectivity fields between SARS KOV-2 and Eating Mormons, the beta corona viruses associated with SARS KOV-2, SARS KOV-2 and RATG13 share the highest sequential similarity of the full genome sequence.
One of the predominant speculations is that the high degree of similarity between SARS COV-2 receptor connectivity fields in the Corona Beta and SARS COV-2 viruses belonging to the selectively-appropriate evolution.
There is an anti-proposal that is likely to re-install between SARS KOV-2 in the Corona Beta and RaTG13 viruses in the third wild animal species.
The re-installation is widespread among beta corona viruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS KOV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to human corona viruses, the animal origin of human corona viruses-229E, human corona viruses-OC43, human corona viruses-NL63, and human corona viruses-HKU1 was also studied.
The evolution evidence has indicated that both human corona viruses-NL63 and human corona viruses-229E may be derived from the corona viruses of the peasant, while the father viruses of human corona viruses-OC43 and human corona viruses-HKU1 were found in the peasant.
The coronavirus in the coronavirus, known as ARCoV.2 (coronavirus high flash), was discovered in the triangular coronavirus in North America and was closely linked to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, the human corona-229E virus was found to be genetically linked to another corona virus in the cranberries, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana and was also suspected of being hosted by the mediator.
For clarification, the current information on the animal assets of human coronavirus known in Figure 1 and Table 2 is summarized.
The analysis of the evolution of races presented evidence of cases of transition of human corona viruses between species throughout history.
When human coronavirus-OC43 species transmitted humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection epidemic was recorded.
The history of transmission of human coronavirus-229E among species is still less obvious.
Corona alpha viruses have been found to be related to human corona viruses-229E.
There is a coronavirus in Albatros.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from humans to humans.
First, humans and not albacas may have a connection with the scraper in a common environmental home.
While humans have a close connection with Albacca.
Secondly, human corona-229E viruses of corona alfa viruses are multiple and uncoverable to the disease in the corona, while corona alfa viruses in the albaca cause the epidemic of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, alpha corona virus associated with albacca was not discovered in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that Albacca has been infected with the human corona-229E virus that belongs to a thousand humans.
In fact, pineapple is a direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including the dog disease virus, Ebola virus, Nebaha virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that humans can transmit human corona-229E virus directly to humans.
While Corona alpha viruses in Kharkiv play the role of the human Corona-229E genetic collection, Albacca and the only dark beauty may act as hosts to transmit viruses to humans, just as it is in Mers-Kov.
Merce-Cow gives an excellent example of the transition between species, it moves from peaches to the only dark beauty and the only dark beauty to humans.
The evolutionary origins of Mers-Kov from Kefavish have been known since the beginning of their recognition and have also been enhanced by subsequent results.
Obviously, Kefavish provides a rich collection of viral species to exchange genetic pieces within one species and transmit them between species.
They have long life, live in crowded colonies, close social interaction, strong ability to fly, and all of them are favourable conditions to make them an ideal "virus distributor".
On the other hand, Mers-Kov has moved to the only sleeping beauty over the decades.
You can adapt to this beauty a good adjustment so that you’re converted from a broker’s host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
MERS-COV causes a very mild disease andins a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
His interrupted transition to humans remains a coincidence and man becomes an untransmitted host to Merce-Kov where his transition cannot continue.
Contrary to the role of beauty in the transfer of Mers-Kov, the role of the Mormon Eating, if found, in the transfer of Sars-Kov-2 is different.
In particular, the corona beta viruses associated with the eating of harshmorms have a severe illness.
They may be non-transmitter hosts of the SARS KOV-2 of the corona beta virus, like the yogurt cat in the SARS-KOV case.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities of SARS COV-2 transition between species from animals to humans either by proofing or excluding them.
First, it may be a storage add-on of the virus associated with SARS COV-2, which is mostly equivalent to SARS COV-2.
Humans and humans can share the environmental hometown through massacre or coal mining.
Secondly, myrtle myrtles can be one of the medium-sized hosts of the recently discovered SARS COV-2 virus.
People get infected with the virus by killing and consuming cattle meat.
Many breasts, including pets, are likely to be affected by Sars Kov-2.
There is something that justifies the study of the antibodies in pets and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, there may have been a re-installation and adjustment of the Cov-2 Sars in the third type that has a connection with the cravings and eats the cravings.
The search for the animal origin of SARS KOV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different species of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three major and important factors in facilitating coronavirus infection to cross the species barriers.
First, the mutation rates are relatively high in the duplication of the ribose DNA.
The estimated coronavirus mutations rates, compared to one-chain coronavirus viruses, can be considered “mediate” or “high” with an average conversion rate of ~ 10-4 variations each year for site 2, depending on the coronavirus adjustment stage with the new hosts.
Corona viruses include an external corrective enzyme, which leads to its removal to a very high conversibility and degeneration or incapacity to evolve.
Interestingly, the drug is known for its ability to catch the coronavirus by inhibiting the external ribonoclease enzyme and polymerase of the ribonic DNA based on the ribonic DNA.
Remedicifer is one of the anti-covering factors for SARS KOV-2 and is scheduled to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than the host rates.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the coronavirus does not adapt properly to the host.
The mutation rate of the Cov-2 is significantly low when compared to the Cov-Cov with a high conversion rate, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems that it can already adapt to another host close to man.
In addition to SARS KOV-2, this also applies to MERS-KOV, which is well adapted to the only dark beauty.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic deviation of vaccines and antiviral drugs will help resist SARS COV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the massive coronavirus DNA genome actively provides an additional moon in the modification of the genome of eruptions and re-installation, thus increasing the likelihood of common development between species, which is beneficial in the emergence of new coronavirus when the conditions become suitable for it.
This is supported by unique, abundant open reading patterns and encrypted protein functions near the end of the 3′ gene.
Thirdly, coronavirus alternates patterns randomly and repeatedly during the reproduction of the riboxic DNA through the unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixed bowl, a sequence change occurs frequently during the coronavirus DNA copies.
High-symbolic full-length and secondary genetic DNA acids can reinstall to generate new coronavirus.
A special guide to the development of races for natural re-installation in human corona viruses-HKU1 and human corona viruses-OC43, as well as animal corona viruses as in corona viruses similar to the severe severe respiratory syndrome viruses in Kharkivish and corona viruses-HKU9 in Kharkivish.
The virus interacts with the host associated with the move.
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, the viral interaction with the future host is another major factor affecting the transition between species.
In this regard, we consider Sars-Kov reinstallation as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during transitional incidents.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-COV in humans and yogurt, I think SARS-COV is rapidly adapted in different hosts, through mutations that occur in the field of future connections to protein S.
In general, the field of future connectivity of coronavirus protein S interacts with the cellular future and is intensely selected by the host body’s antibody response.
In Sars-Kov, the field of association of future amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in S1, which is linked to the enzyme converter of angiotensin 2 as well as the future aid to enter the virus.
The future connectivity field in Sars-Kov is able to identify the future of the angiotensin-transforming enzyme in different animals, including puppy, yogurt, mouse, and racon dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acids were observed that were different from the virus-isolated samples of humans and yogurt in the field of future connectivity, 4 of which were in the future-related pattern of interaction with the future of angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2.
The K479N and S487T mutants are in the field of future bonds of Sars-Kov in the yogurt cat, which can increase the probability of spike protein interaction in the future of the human angiotensin-2 enzyme converter.
In other words, these two types of amino acid alternatives may be important for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS KOV-2 is part of the same cell future in SARS-KOV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS KOV-2 and SARS-KOV in the S1 protein unit, which indicates implicitly that the probability of the S protein in the human enzyme converter for angiotensin 2 has changed.
In fact, a study with the ultra-cold microscope has shown that the probability of this link is about 10 to 20 times higher than that that occurs between the human angiotensin-transformer enzyme 2 and the S-protein in Sars-Kov.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other kind of future aid may be needed for the Sars Cov-2 transition.
It is also interesting that the human corona-NL63 virus is also linked to the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme but in a different part of the protein S.
There are many other human coronavirus futures, such as the human coronavirus-229E protein analyst, and the human coronavirus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after transition between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular future, the result of transition between species to human coronavirus is also subject to control of other reliability factors and host restrictions.
The spread of these host proteins among humans and hosts of natural coronavirus warehouses, such as cranberries, the only dark beauty, and cranberries, may be an obstacle to the transition between species.
Human corona viruses need to control the host’s dependence factors and weaken the restrictive factors to perform a successful transition between species.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important space for the interaction of the virus with the host remain detectable and identifiable properties.
The widespread and unprecedented examination of the genome can be used to explore the dependence factors and host limitations of the SARS COV-2 using advanced Crisper technology.
The Emergency of Human Corona Viruses: Return to the Beginning Point
The variety of corona viruses in humans offers plenty of opportunities for the development of new human corona viruses.
Based on this logic, corona viruses are a genetic complex of human corona viruses.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic restructuring also drive the human coronavirus development process, which are two important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of renewed protein encryption genes involves the ability to modify viral visual patterns significantly.
Among the organizational proteins of SARS-COV, I think ORF8 is important in adapting to humans, where SARS-COV virus-related is isolated in the worm but it is found to encrypt different ORF8 proteins.
It was found that the 29 properties of the Sars-Kov Neucleotide Removal were found in isolated races at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has led to the division of ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptation boom that enhances host switching.
In addition, Sars-Kov has a history of possible re-installation through the Alpha and Gama corona viruses, where a large number of small re-installation areas in the polymeres are identified by the ribose-based DNA polymeres.
Reinstalling sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the Mers-Kov epidemic has seen cases of reinstallation between different races, which occurred in the only dark beauty in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, reinstallations were also observed in other human corona viruses, where human corona viruses, along with other animal corona viruses, combined in their non-structured genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintentional changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result in the elimination of viruses from selectively performed pressures, such as what happens by the host’s immune system.
Full-length loss of ORF4 protein in the visual pattern of human corona-229E virus is due to the removal of two nucleotids an example of these effects.
Despite the possibility of proper observation of ORF4 in the beauty and scratch viruses associated with the human corona-229E virus, the corona alfa virus that infects the alpha shows one nucleotide injections, which leads to a swelling of the corona frame.
Last but not last, the development of the new corona viruses is also driven by selective pressure in their own stored hosts.
Non-symptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases have been detected only when the coronavirus is infected, which indicates the mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and the coronavirus.
It has shown that the cranberries adapted properly to coronavirus anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the weak activation of the infection-supporting response in the spider was reduced by the effectiveness of pathogens caused by coronavirus.
Furthermore, the natural killer cell activity in the cranberries was interrupted due to the increased rate of the future natural killer cell attached NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main compact tissue compound particles of category I.
In addition, the high levels of interactive oxygen compounds (types of interactive oxygen compounds) resulting from the high metabolic activity of the scratch can lead to both the coronavirus copying cap and the effect of correction by the external ribonoclease enzyme, thereby providing selective pressure for the development of viral races that are highly pathogens when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic races of the coronavirus may arise by reconstitution, which leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three human corona viruses have been revealed over the past two decades.
The coronavirus is not pathogenic or causes mild symptoms in stored hosts such as peanut butter and beauty.
They copy strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why they see viruses that don’t show symptoms and causes of severe cases of human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytocin storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lungs damage.
On the contrary, in the case of non-symptomatic diseases, the immune response is separated from the coronavirus reproduction.
Similar strategy for separation of immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-Cov-2 therapy.
The interferon reaction is specifically strong in the cranberries.
Consequently, the intake of type I interferon can be benefited at least at the first stage of the SARS COV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle cryopherine NLRP3 is weak.
In this mental logic, the inhibition of the inflammatory particle cryopharyn NLRP3 using the MCC950 inhibitor is useful in the treatment of Covid-19.
The emergence of SARS KOV-2 follows the general idea of SARS-KOV and MERS-KOV.
While it was discovered that Sars-Kov’s beta coronavirus in Kharkiv has a 95% share in the Nucleotide homogenity, there was also a coronavirus in Kharkiv that has a 96% share in the Nucleotide homogenity with Sars-Kov-2.
While it was discovered that yogurt cats and other animals on the market contain viruses similar to the SARS-KOV, they did not discover the direct intermediate hosts of the SARS-KOV-2.
Corona beta viruses have been discovered in myrtle eating which are highly homogeneous with SARS KOV-2, which indicates that myrtle eating animals may be one of the intermediate hosts or that corona beta viruses in myrtle eating have contributed to a genetic fragment, leading to the reach of the final version of SARS KOV-2.
Although the questions are still raised, there is no evidence that SARS KOV-2 was made by humans either by intention or by coincidence.
Corona viruses have returned to the focus of attention due to the beginning of the latest spread of Sars Kov-2.
The study of coronavirus in peasants and other animals has significantly changed our idea of the importance of the origins of animal disease and animal warehouses of human coronavirus in transition to humans.
Damag evidence has shown that SARS-KOV, MERS-KOV, and SARS-KOV-2 are all due to their origin to the puppy and transmitted to man through intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that the SARS-COV infection arose from the contact between humans and yogurt cats in the markets, the closure of the markets of fresh products and the killing of yogurt cats was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same mental logic, mushrooms should be removed from the markets of fresh products in order to prevent the transmission of animal disease, in the light of the discovery of multiple corona beta viruses in mushrooms that are very close to Sars Cove-2.
However, whether SARS COV-2 was transmitted to humans or not, as well as whatever way it was transmitted, through wild myrtle eating animals and other mammals, its transfer remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Mers-Kov was found in the only beautiful sleeping for a long time.
This beauty is an important means of communication as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the beauty of controlling Merce, just as officials of China’s wildlife markets did to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To stop repeated epidemic cases of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be followed to develop effective MERS-COV vaccines, as well as other anti-infection measures.
Because we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may develop and cause eruptions.
There are a variety of corona viruses associated with animal diseases originating in wildlife.
In particular, the corona viruses are extremely diverse in pearls that involve the possibility of causing animal disease.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and re-installation of coronavirus related to animal diseases, leading to the emergence of new coronavirus more portable and/or fatal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Under the difficulties that humanity has experienced due to Sars, Mers and Covid-19, an appropriate plan of caution and response should be prepared.
The fact suggests that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural warehouses until they get a chance to spread and multiply.
Although the puppy has many characteristics that predict the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with the puppy and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to get away from it.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary procedure for better understanding of the coronavirus environment and its natural hosts, which proves its usefulness in preventing its transition from animals to humans and preventing future occurrences.
Finally, the best way to prevent animal viral diseases is to remove humans from the environmental sites of natural warehouses of animal viral diseases.
The mystery of the animal origin of the SARS COV-2 remains surrounded by a number of questions that require answers.
First of all, if the spider transmits the origins of the SARS COV-2 virus to spider spiders, it is important to know the conditions that prepared for spiders and spider spiders to share the similar environmental place.
Secondly, if it plays a greater direct role in the transmission of the disease to man, then it should be determined how man communicates with it.
Thirdly, if the third type of mammals plays the role of the real intermediary host, then it should be explained how they interact with the different species, including humans, pearls, and the eating of pearls.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying the SARS COV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether the host is a puppy, a puppy or other pigs, it is expected to identify the SARS KOV-2 or the father viruses from which it branches, which almost match in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuing research in this field will reveal the evolutionary path of Cov-2 in animals, with what it includes important measures to prevent and combat Covid-19 in humans.
The need to update the standard "such state" and "confirm state" when diagnosed with Covid-19 disease
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of Corona 2019 (Corona 2019), and this guidelines have provided our experience and provide appropriate reference information for the worldwide fighting of the disease.
Although Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and awareness are gradually increasing based on the results of current research and clinical practice experiments; and then the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this speech, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and presented the latest diagnosis criteria, the "suchest condition" and the "confirmed condition", according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis of Covid-19 and its treatment (Seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, Corona Virus 2019 (Corona Virus 2019), which is now officially known as Corona Virus 2019 (Covid-19) and the virus is called Corona 2 associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described Covid-19 as a disease.
To fight SARS KOV-2 infection, our team has drawn up a quick guidance and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
I have been very interested since it was published.
Please note that although Covid-19 is a new disease, our awareness and awareness are gradually increasing based on the results of current research and clinical practice experiments; and then the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, from the Guidelines for Covid-19 Diagnosis and Treatment issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, a total of seven versions with some contexts changing substantially.
Now our guidelines were answered by a comment from Chu and others, who submitted a simple proposal to monitor scores based on clinical experiment.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidelines and have also become a valuable reference to this bullying around the world.
We support their great efforts and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest Covid-19 diagnosis guidelines and its treatment (the seventh experimental version) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of the suspected state requires the combination of any of the elements of the characteristics of the epidemic history and two of the elements of the clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or requires the verification of three elements of the clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemic history:
Epidemiological history: (1) date including travel to the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities with reports of Covid-19 infection, or residence, within the last 14 days before the symptoms begin; (2) date including contact with Covid-2 infection cases (with positive results of the DNA test); (3) date including contact with Covid or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan, surrounding areas or other communities with reports of Covid-19 infection during the last 14 days before the symptoms begin; (4) date including contact with Covid-2 infection cases (with positive results of the DNA test); (3) date including contact with Covid or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan, surrounding areas or other communities with reports of Covid-19 infection during the last 14 days before the symptoms begin;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or symptoms of the respiratory system; (2) with characteristics demonstrated by the visual examination of the Covid-19 infection; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells normal, low, or low of the number of lymphs in the early stages of the infection.
The confirmed state diagnosis of a suspicious state involving any of the elements of the evidence of the presence of pathogens or blood cell interactions should be based on the following: (1) positive results of the real-time PCR test for SARS COV-2; (2) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with the well-known characteristics of the coronavirus; (3) positive results of the IgM and IgG body test for SARS COV-2 in the seed; or negative to positive changes of the IgG body for SARS COV-2; or the high level of recovery is equal to 4 or more levels in the seed.
We see that the real-time polymerase sequential DNA reaction test in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second version (18 January 2020) and the third version (22 January 2020).
The detection of the pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then the blood cell interaction guide was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments have relyed on the continued work of researchers to reach the design of an ideal set of tools for DNA discovery for quick diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory tract including blood samples, which resulted in increased availability of different samples, and supporting the transfer of the positive result of the anti-quality body to the standard of confirmed cases.
In addition, there are increasing evidence that calls us to be cautious when treating patients with unusual symptoms and unaccompanied conditions.
Therefore, the content of the information flow scheme should be updated to Cho and others, where they classified the person without clinical symptoms as a "low-risk" degree.
The scale monitoring system also needs to verify its health in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to access more direct evidence as we invite readers to provide us with their comments.
In order to diagnose “the suspicious state” and “the confirmed state”, we call on to follow and comply with the latest guidelines issued by the country of home of the persons.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths due to Covid-19 disease, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to Covid-19 disease on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day due to the virus.

She also said two of the deaths were from DCA.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the 19th Covid disease on March 11.
A official at an Anatolian hospital, a local news agency, said one of the dead was Jalal Seif Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Authority, who was taking care at the Kuwait Metris Hospital.
Bangladesh's Ministry of Land Transport and Bridges, Abid al-Qadir, said in a video statement on Saturday that public transport will stop for a longer period than was initially planned, until next Saturday.
Public transport interruptions initially began on March 26 and the interruption was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
It is still permitted to transport basic goods, namely: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of Covid-19 disease were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people returning from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three have already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS KOV viruses has exceeded 2 million in the world.
The data released by the Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of coronavirus causing the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) exceeded a million worldwide.
Covid-19 virus caused at least 52,000 deaths.

Australian shops reduce the boundaries of purchasing toilet paper for each transaction
The two Australian Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale Wholesale
The Aldi Store has also announced that it will be on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in stores and their Facebook pages.
Reports have that buyers have been deposited because of concerns related to Covid-19 disease if people need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Wool and Heritage shops agreed to restrict the delivery of toilet paper to the houses to become one-off for each purchase request.
These changes came after the previous restrictions adopted by the Wall Rates Store on March 4 and the Coles Store on March 5 allowing the purchase of only four folds for each transaction.
In a press release released on March 8, the Cools Store that despite the implementation of the four-stop restrictions, “many stores still sell all of their possessions within an hour of receipt,” the request was described as “unprecedented,” as well as the Aldi stores described in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unpredictable.”
Sales increased “significantly” last week, according to a spokesman for the Wall Worth Store.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the amount permitted to buy is LIFTAN.
In order to alleviate the deficit, the Cols stores ordered suppliers for greater shifts and increased delivery rates, and the Walls stores ordered additional stocks, while the Aldi stores allowed their stocks for special offers scheduled for early Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on the time of delivery of trucks make it more difficult.
The high production costs are expected, where suppliers are trying to meet demand, with the lack of special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that due to early stock availability, some stores will not be able to provide a private Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortemers, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, in a report to News.com.au that stores fill the stores every night.
He pointed out that the toilet paper is a large product, which leads to a decrease in the amount of stocks in terms of numbers, and when fully packed, it leaves large empty spaces on the roofs, which enhances the feeling of lack.
Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News, said: “Colls and Wools and Wools stores have a view that if they have a lot of goods on the roofs, and if it is possible to buy and supply products such as toilets and sterilizers in large amounts, it may reduce the panic.”
The company Who Gives a Crap, which manufactures recycled toilet paper, last Wednesday that its stocks were exhausted.
According to News.com.au, Cambridge-Clark, which manufactures towels Clinique, and Solaris Piper, which manufactures towels Sorbent, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, noted that some real estate sellers offer a free toilet paper to the first tender in Melbourne, while fewer auctions occurred because buyers stopped working on the long weekend of the Workers' Day.
The Thursday edition of the newspaper NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight-page ads made so that they can be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The stores were initially hesitated about imposing restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3, where the stores they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a large demand for other products, including rubber, sterilizers, drying goods, handwashing and clothes.
In the same way, outside Australia, it was noticed on Sunday evening that a British online store named Okado determines the purchases of Andres' toilet paper with two packages from 12 to.
The World Health Organization says Covid-19 is hungry.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the continued spread of Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus associated with the severe respiratory syndrome known as Sars Cov-2 - has reached the level of the wound.
Although the word “sickness” indicates only the extent of the disease’s spread and not the severity of certain cases, the World Health Organization has noted the need to push governments to take the necessary measures:
“Every country can still change the path of this epidemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanum Gibrassos, said: “If countries are discovered and examined, people are treated, isolated, their cases are followed and they are gathered for confrontation.”
“We are all very concerned about the levels of spread and worrying danger, as well as the levels of disadvantage that are warning of danger.”
According to Dr. Tom Freden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this disease is “unprecedented.”
In a statement published by CNN in February, he said, “No other respiratory virus has been traced from the beginning of its appearance to its continued global spread, except for the flu.”
Gibraltar expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never had a coronavirus disease before.”
“We have never seen a hunger that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a hunger after the World Health Organization’s decision in January to declare that the disease is a public health emergency that raises international concern.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said about the spread of the disease: "In conclusion, things will get worse."
The Associated Press that there have been at least 126,000 cases of Covid-19 disease worldwide since Thursday, and more than 4,600 cases of death.
Coronavirus 2019-20 is an ongoing coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) disease caused by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2).
The epidemic in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019 and declared an international alarming public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and was recognized as hungry on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of Covid-19 have been in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The average death rate in China is 4%, while worldwide is between 13.04% in Algeria and 08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing difficulty.
Complications may include pneumonia and severe respiratory disorder syndrome.
The period between the exposure to the infection and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific anti-virus treatment.
Basic therapy is a supporting and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive procedures include handwashing, mouth covering when coughing, keeping trace between people, monitoring, and self-isolation of suspects.
Authorities around the world are responding to this danger by imposing travel restrictions, sanitary stones, traffic prohibitions, workplace risk controls, and closing facilities.
This bullying has led to a severe global social and economic disorder, the delay or cancellation of sports, religious, political, and cultural events, and the widespread supply shortage is worsening due to the purchasing shortage.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting around 99.4 percent of the number of students worldwide.
False information about the virus has spread on the internet, and there have been accidents of foreign terrorism and discrimination against Chinese, and other people of origin and appearance in East and Southeast Asia, and other areas where major cases of the virus have occurred.
As a result of the decrease in travel rates and closure of heavy industries, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (China's capital Hubei) a series of cases of pneumonia for an unknown reason on 31 December 2019 and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Wuhan market for wholesale, so the virus is believed to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the spread is known as SARS COV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the corona viruses in the pineapple, the corona viruses in the pineapple and SARS COV. The first person to show symptoms was discovered on 1 December 2019 and this person had no clear connection with the moist market group that was later discovered.
Among the early cases listed in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report published by the South China Morning Journal pointed out that the 55-year-old Hubei province was the first. on February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization that despite the decline of new cases in China, it has suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases within it for the first time.
There may be a significant deficiency in reporting cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively few cases were among young people, with adults aged 19 and under 2.4 percent of cases worldwide.British senior scientific consultant Patrick Valens estimated that 60% of British people had to get infected before an effective sheep immunity was taken.
The cases indicate the number of people who were subjected to the Covid-19 examination, and their infection was confirmed according to official protocols.
Since March 23, none of the countries has been tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies regarding not testing for those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that approximately 86% of Covid-19 infections were not discovered in China until January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 indicates that the number of injuries in Italy was much greater than the recorded cases.
The initial estimates of the Basic Reproduction Number (R0) of the Fed-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with Covid-19.
For those who do not recover, the period of deterioration of symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, Covid-19 caused about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 80% of deaths in China from February 5 were concentrated in people over the age of 60 and 75% suffered from preexisting diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths caused by Covid-19 generally indicate the deaths that were proven caused by Covid according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths caused by Covid-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without their test - for example; at home, or in the role of the care of the elderly, etc.
Part data in Italy revealed that the number of over-deaths during the shock exceeded the official number of deaths recorded by 4-5x factory.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. acknowledged "we know that [an announced mortality] reflects a lower estimate than the reality," a statement supported by narrative reports indicating the uncertainty in the U.S. This type of uncertainty occurs in cases of wounds; such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic was the first confirmed death case in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first case of death outside of main China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first case of death outside of Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than twelve deaths were recorded outside China’s main land in both Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and regions deaths, in all continents except the South Pole; many measures are commonly used to determine the rate of deaths.
These numbers vary according to the region and time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options and the time it takes since the start of the disease, and the population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
According to the statistics of the Johns Hopkins University, the world’s death toll to injuries is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) from 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the area.
In China, the rate of deaths from infection has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures indicate the rate of deaths (CFR) that reflects the percentage of deaths from the disease, and the percentage of deaths from infection (FR) that reflects the percentage of deaths from the disease.
These statistics do not have a timeline and track a specific population group from the infection to the fate of the situation.
A number of academics tried to count these numbers for certain population groups.
The evidence-based medical center at Oxford University estimates that the total mortality rate of infection is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test of the Covid-19 in Germany, and with a statistical study that analyzes the effect of the test on the estimates of the mortality rate.
The World Health Organization emphasizes the ability to control the illness.
The peak of explosion and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Masaj Boni, from the Pennsylvania State University, said: “The epidemic of infectious diseases that they leave uncontrolled usually reaches the peak and begins to decline after that when the disease does not find hosts available.
But it is almost impossible to reach any logical forecast now about the time."
Chong Nanjing, chief medical consultant of the Chinese government, said that it could end by June if it could encourage all countries to follow the WHO’s advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kutsharsky from the London School of Health Conservation and Heat Zone Medicine that SARS KOV-2 "will be spread for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial London College under the world’s supervision of Neil Ferguson, we’ll need to rely on physical distinction and other measures “until the vaccine becomes available (maybe after 18 months or more).”
William Shawner from the University of Vanderbelt said, “I think this coronavirus is unlikely to disappear completely—because it is easily transmitted,” and it has been “transformed into a seasonal disease—so it returns every year.”
Returns will depend on the collective immunity and the extent of transformation.
The symptoms of Covid-19 may be relatively unidentified and may not show any symptoms in the affected.
The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The least common symptoms include fatigue, discharge, loss of breathing, difficulty breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat inflammation, headache, scratch, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or scratch. The World Health Organization confirms that one in six people suffer from severe illness and have difficulty breathing.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has an emergency symptoms of difficulty in breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest, sudden disturbance, difficulty in awakening, face or lips clots. Immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms appear. The exacerbation of the development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory difficulty syndrome, intanus, intanus trauma, and death.
Symptoms may not appear in some patients, who do not have any clinical symptoms but the results of the tests confirm their infection, so specialists have given advice that people who are mixed with the cases that have been confirmed should be monitored and closely examined to exclude the infection.
China estimates that the percentage of cases without symptoms ranges between a few and 44%.
The usual childhood period (the period between the infection and the appearance of symptoms) ranges from one day to 14 days; often five days. As an example of a confusion, an estimate of the group of people with Covid-19 who lost the sense of smell in the beginning was 30% and then recently decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spreading are still being investigated.
It is believed that the disease is mainly spread during mixing, or by spreading when coughing, swallowing or speaking, when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that cough without covering the mouth can result in a spread that spreads for a distance from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (27 ft).
Some believe that the virus can also be transmitted through the spray hanging in the air for a long time, which can be produced while speaking. it can also produce the respiratory spray during the spinning process, including when speaking, although the virus is not transmitted by the air in general.
Spray may be placed on the mouth or nose of close persons or inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as infusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the release of respiratory emissions on the spray and then cause dispersion through the air.
It can also spread when a person touches a polluted surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, his nose, or his mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spread from the output to the mouth, it is believed that this risk is limited.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS COV-2 transition from the outbreak to the mouth. the virus is more infectious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during the subsequent stages of the disease.
People with the disease were shown up to three days before the symptoms appear, which indicates the possibility of transition before the symptoms are severe.
There are only a few reports of cases without laboratory confirmed symptoms, but the symptoms-free transition was identified by some countries during intermittent tracking surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some mystery about how easy the disease is to spread, one person can count from two to three other people in general.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, one day on solid paper, and up to four hours on baker.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature. pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with Covid-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend washing hands after contacting animals, as is when touching other surfaces that may be touched by one of the infected.
Corona 2 associated with severe respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of severe respiratory disease in Wuhan.
SARS KOV-2 viruses in all their properties share with corona viruses in nature. outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, where its preventive membrane is dissolved. SARS KOV-2 viruses are closely linked to the original SARS KOV virus.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the corona virus met genetically with the corona beta virus gender, and belongs to the subgender of the corona sarby virus (Race B) as well as two races of the corona origin.
96% on the entire genome level coincides with other coronavirus samples in Kharkiv (Bat Kov G 13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome series between viruses generated by humans and viruses generated by humans.
A total comparison of the gene has resulted in the discovery of a maximum of 92% of genetic material sharing between the coronavirus and the SARS COV-2 virus, which is insufficient to prove that the coronavirus is the median family of the virus.
The viral infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although confirmation is eventually made by the sequential reversal polymer reaction (RR-T-BCR) of the infected emissions or computed intermittent imaging.
A study in Wuhan compared sequential polymerosis interaction with computed polymerosis imaging found that computed polymerosis imaging is more sensitive than sequential polymerosis interaction, although it is less accurate, with many of its characteristics interfering with pneumonia and other satisfactory stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiation Photography recommends “Do not use computing screening to detect Covid-19 or consider it a preliminary examination to diagnose the disease.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published multiple DNA test protocols for SARS KOV-2 for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase series reversal (RRT-BCR) interaction in real time.
Testing can be done on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
This test is generally carried out by a nasal cluster, and it can also be used a throat cluster. a number of laboratories and companies are developing cluster tests that detect the antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, no of them has been sufficiently accurate to depend on its widespread use.
The Mussolini test, developed by Silix, received an accreditation to be used in U.S. emergency cases in accredited laboratories only.
Radiation and CT screening characteristics for people with the symptoms of the disease include an unlikely end-to-end, such as scratched glass darkness and confused crystal scratch.
The Italian Association of Radiation collects an international online database for the results of the photograph for confirmed cases of infection.
Radiation without a sequential polymerase reaction is a limited accuracy procedure in relation to the detection of Covid-19, due to its interference with other diseases such as gland virus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of calculated screening of the chest with the sequential polymerase reaction and showed that although the screening is less accurate in terms of proof of infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggested to be a test tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based telavial neuron networks have been developed to detect viral imaging properties in both radiation and computing section imaging.
Prevention strategies includeining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a cloth when coughing or swallowing and then removing it by throwing it directly into the waste basket.
People who are already infected are advised to wear a medical mask in public places.
Physical distraction procedures are also recommended to prevent the transmission of infection. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel from countries and areas affected by the disease's spread or advised not to travel.
However, the virus has reached a phase of spread throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread within communities, and some individuals don’t know where or how they have been infected. healthcare providers, who take care of a person who is likely to be infected, are advised to take appropriate measures, mixing precautions and eye protection.
The government’s use of mobile site identification data for the purpose of tracking has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for the restriction of this type of surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been designed or launched for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than twelve specialized groups have worked to find privacy-considering solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close the user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they get closer to a person who has been proven to be infected with Covid-19, which promotes misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and swallowing the mouth is not a useful solution.
There is no vaccine for Covid-19, although many organizations are working on the production of the vaccine.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease and Prevention recommends people to wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the swelling appears on the hands, before eating, after emptying the nose, cough or swelling.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside the body; where it destroys its preventive membrane.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also recommended the use of a hand sterilizer containing at least 60% alcohol when water and soap are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned using a number of cleansers (in one minute of the cleansing position on the stainless steel surface), including Ethanol 62–71% and Izopranol 50–100% and Nodium Chloride 0.1% and Hydroxide 0.5% and Iodopovidone 0.2–7.5%.
There are other purificators, such as benzalconium chloride and glucose chloride, with less efficiency.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected to be infected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and the ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations have recommended people to cover their mouths and nails when they are coughing or swallowing either by swallowing and putting it in front of their mouth and nose or using a paper pants and removing any towels immediately.
Those who are likely to be affected are recommended using medical masks, wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it cuts when it is caused by speech, swelling, and cough.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on the time and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the desire [persons] to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned."
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people do not wear masks only if they are exposed to a high risk of infection, such as those who take care of Covid-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States is recommended to wear an unmedical face mask made of clothes. China specifically recommended to healthy people to use removable medical masks, especially if people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less) are contacted directly.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transportation or staying in busy places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make clothes at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned entering public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has forced everyone entering a shop to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all the inhabitants to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has requested trains and cross-city bus passengers to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear a face mask when you go out, and it is also recommended to make face masks at home for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distinction (also known as physical distinction) includes anti-infection measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing the confusion between individuals to a minimum.
The roads include sanitary stone; imposing travel restrictions; and closing schools, workplaces, theatres, theatres, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply the ways of social distinction by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding busy areas, sharing greetings without touch, and physical distinction from others.
Many governments are currently imposing or recommending social deviation in areas affected by the disease.
The maximum assembly size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if the spread of Covid-19 is not detected in the region) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public assemblies for more than two people. Elderly and people with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, weak immune system risk, increased risk of developing diseases and serious complications. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised them to stay at home as much as possible in the areas of the disease epidemic among communities. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with the term "social distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce the risk of developing diseases and serious complications and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised them to stay at home as much as possible in the areas of the disease epidemic.
The use of the term "social distinction" led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, instead of encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means.
This includes recommendations not to have sex except with a person you live with who is not a carrier of the virus or suffers from its symptoms.
Self-isolation in the house is recommended for people with Covid-19 and those suspected of being affected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. several governments have imposed or recommended self-health stone to all the inhabitants living in affected areas.
The strongest self-health stone instructions were issued for those of the most dangerous categories.
Those who have treated a person with Covid-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region where the infection is widespreadly transmitted with self-healing stone for 14 days are advised from another possible time of exposure.
Strategies to control the epidemic of the disease are to contain or suppress and reduce the spread.
The containers are applied at the early stages of the disease, aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, as well as introducing other anti-infection measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When preventing the spread of the disease becomes impossible, efforts are then directed to the relief phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and relieve its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of retention and relief measures can be done at the same time.
Inhibition requires more rigorous measures to reverse the path of the wound by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.The part of the management of the epidemic is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of health care stress and saves more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address the disease spread include personal preventive measures, such as hand cleansing, wearing masks and self-healing stone; community actions aimed at physical disconnection such as closing schools and annulling major gathering events; community solidarity to encourage admission and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleansing. more stringent measures were taken to prevent the disease spread in China as soon as the severity of the disease becomes clear, such as the application of health stone on the whole city and the imposition of a strict travel prohibition.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced collective tests and local health stones, and has issued warnings about the movements of the injured.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who isolated themselves and imposed large fines on those who did not do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized the accumulation of medical supplies. simulations for the UK and the U.S. show that relieving (lowering the spread of the epidemic and not stopping it) and inhibiting (in contrast to the epidemic growth) are facing major challenges.
Optimum relief policies may reduce the peak of health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress in health systems.
The inhibition may be preferable, but it should be kept as long as the virus spreads to humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), since the transition, on the other hand, moves quickly when the measures are relieved.
The long-term intervention to suppress illness causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific anti-virus medications approved for Covid-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing existing medications.
Drinking medications to treat colds that are treated without a prescription, drinking fluids and relaxing may help relieve the symptoms.
Based on severity, oxygen treatment, vein fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may make the results worse.
Many pre-adopted compounds for treatment of other viral diseases are subject to examination for use in Covid-19.
The World Health Organization also that some “traditional and home treatments” could provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS COVID-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care centers to satisfy the needs of Covid-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the eruption.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the focus of laboratory services on the COVID-19 test, the cancellation of optional procedures as possible, the separation and isolation of COVID-19 patients, and the enhancement of the capacity of concentrated care through staff training and the increase in the number of artificial respiratory devices and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first condition originated (the so-called zero patient).
The date of the first known coronavirus infection may be from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Ubi, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Wuhan marine market for wholesale, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species of animals; or, in other words, it has an animal origin. A group of pneumonians for an unknown reason was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jishan at the Hubei County Hospital, which the Disease Control Center in Jianghan Bohan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of the “coronavirus like Sars”.

The Wuhan Municipality’s Health Committee later issued a public notice on December 31 and it to the World Health Organization.
A sufficient number of unknown cases of pneumonia were to the health authorities in Wuhan, which led them to begin the investigation in early January. during the early stages of the disease, the number of cases was doubling every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transmitted to other Chinese provinces, with the help of shifts during the Chinese New Year and Con Wuhan a transport center and a cruise point for the main railways.

On 23 January, in response to the Central Authority’s decision to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Guden Galia noted that while “it’s not a World Health Organization’s recommendation,” it was “a very important indicator of commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is highly focused,” and described it as “unprecedented in the history of public health.” on 30 January, after confirming the transition from one to another outside China, and increasing the number of cases in other countries, the World Health Organization announced the emergency as an emergency for public health of international interest (WHO), which is the sixth state of public health concerns since this year.
The World Health Organization (WHO) General Director said that considering the epidemic a public health emergency is of international interest due to the "risk of global spread, in low and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that “there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessarily contrary to international travel and trade” and that “World Health Organization does not recommend reducing trade and mobility.”

On the same day, Tedros that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has agreed to provide "the entire UN system's potential in response."
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team was prepared, which enabled the coordination of the United Nations response as a whole, and the World Health Organization will allow it to “focus on health response while the experience of other agencies can be used to know the wider social, economic, and developmental effects of the explosion.”
On February 14, a joint mission team led by the World Health Organization with China was prepared to provide international experts and experts from the World Health Organization on the ground in China to help the local administration and evaluate “the severity and portability of the disease” by hosting workshops and meetings with major national institutions, and conducting field visits to evaluate “the impact of response activities on the provinces and cities, including urban and rural areas.” on February 25, the World Health Organization announced that “the world must do more to prepare for the potential coronavirus list,” pointing that it was the first time that he described it as a reward, but it would be the first time that the “reaction activity” will be evaluated.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization’s Emergency Health Program, warned in a statement that “this is a real test for every government on earth: so we must be alert.
This virus may be on its way and you must be prepared for it,” he urged to take the right response measures that can help the world avoid “what’s worst.”
Ryan also pointed out that the current data does not justify the public health officials to declare the disease as a global list, saying such an announcement means "we essentially accept that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus."

On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts confirmed respect for the rights of each individual during the Covid-19 hunger.
The expert group that each person has the right to life-saving interventions and the government is responsible for this.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health insurance should not be justified for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts emphasize that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, elderly, domestic displaced, non-host, living in very bad conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups who need government support.
International government organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information about policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From the policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closure and travel restrictions, the digital axis includes a state policy tracking tool, aimed at helping countries learn from each other and facilitating coordinated global response to the corona virus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the U.S., the British Prime Minister Michael Goff, and Edward Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for how they dealt with the wound, which began in the Chinese Hubei province.
Several leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) have been dismissed at several sectors due to their deal with the health stone efforts in central China, pointing to disgrace over the political institution’s response to the explosion in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public discomfort over the corona virus.
Some Chinese officials, for example Chao Legian, refused previously to admit that the coronavirus has begun in Wuhan, in favor of the theories of conspiracy claimed by the U.S. or Italy regarding the Covid-19 virus.
The U.S. administration described the coronavirus as a “Chinese” or “Wohan” virus, saying China “ha imposed a blurry on the news that has led to the exacerbation of the virus that is now a global hunger,” which some critics have criticized for being racist “and [attention] is distracted from the failure of its administration to contain the disease.”
Daily Beast received a U.S. government telegraph reviewing the communication scheme with clear sources in the National Security Council, with a statement on a strategy that "all is about China.
We were asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. ”News sources such as Politico, Forin Police and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a promotional push for global influence.
EU Foreign Policy Officer Joseph Borell warned that there is "a geographical political component that involves conflict on influence through the practice of circumference and charity policies."
“China is strongly paying the message that it is, unlike the United States, a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while itly sends aid to the latter two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of transferring the aid they were directed to other countries to their country.
There were disputes related to the mask that were among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has taken over hundreds of artificial respiratory devices directed to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the corona virus.
Italian Ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Masari, said: “It is China that has only responded at the bilateral level.
This is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian army to send military helicopters, private cleaning wagons, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited a "high-level political source" not mentioned his name that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "inappropriate or unprofitable to Italy."
The source accused Russia of launching a "geographical and diplomatic" attack.
Lombardy President Atilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de Mayo denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo aircraft carrying medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “When he provides assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials activate again, they will also be able to react beautifully if necessary.”
NATO’s planned military exercises will take place in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War on a narrow scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the 2020 Defender Training, saying: “In the current public health crisis, the training is not only threatening the lives of the U.S. and many participating European countries but also the inhabitants of the countries in which it will take place.”
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public message to world leaders on March 14, 2020 in which he asks for help, saying his country is struggling to fight the epidemic because of the lack of access to the international markets as a result of the U.S. sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic raised calls to the U.S. to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including comprehensive health care, comprehensive child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predict that this may have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, the diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the shock.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “mysterious and negative health stone efforts” after Japan has announced that anyone coming from South Korea will be placed in health stone at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized towards President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed proposals either calling for the isolation of Moon because of their claims that the government has abused the handling of the explosion or praised its response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this may allow governments to strengthen their control over the power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to judge under an unlimited decree, suspend the parliament as well as elections and punish those who have disclosed false information about the virus and the government deals with the crisis.
He was accused of the corona virus, which led to numerous lack of supplies due to the increasing global use of equipment for the fight against explosions, panic-motivated purchases, and the interruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand of consumers and the stop of suppliers.
Many areas also saw panic-motivated purchases, resulting in the lack of chairs of essential food materials such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanum, the demand for personal protection tools may double by 100 times.
This demand caused prices to rise twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for between four and six months.
It also causes a lack of personal protection tools worldwide, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, it has given a new opportunity to the Diago shopers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to breast milk deficiency in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. despite the widespread spread of Covid-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived a severe food deficiency.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illegal trade of biological products have succeeded in avoiding severe food deficiency in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives’ expectations.
The food shelves were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pig stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, China's economy was seriously damaged in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales dropped by 20.5%.
Since China’s main law is a major economic and industrial center, it has been observed that the virus is a major threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agatha Demares of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that the markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the possible results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impacts of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those that occurred as a result of the SARS between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
Reports have that the OPEC saw a "interruption" after the sharp fall in oil prices due to the decline in demand from China.
The global stock markets dropped on February 24 due to a significant rise in the number of Covid-19 cases outside the main China coast.
On February 27, due to increasing concerns about the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indicators, including NASDAQ-100 and Standard & Exchange 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, its biggest decline in one day since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
The indicators ended the three weeks with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Skop Rathings GMBH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but it kept up to negative expectations.
The shares dropped again due to the fears of the corona virus, and the biggest decline was on March 16.
Many believe that economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed Arian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and states in time.
Central banks react faster than they had during the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel ban, public places closed, including tourist attractions, and warning governments of travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled their flights due to low demand, including British Airlines, Eastern China Airlines, and Watson, while British Regional Airlines, FLIP, collapsed.
The impact on the airline industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincides with the spring holiday season known as Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events involving large crowds, including New Year's celebrations, while private companies have also closed their stores independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many New Year’s Month events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gathering, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temples exhibitions.
In 24 provinces of 31 provinces, and in municipalities and districts in China, the authorities extended New Year's holidays to 10 February, and issued instructions to most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of response to infectious diseases to its highest level, announced a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled the New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail traders in North America and the Middle East saw a decrease between 50 and 60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43 percent decrease in passenger traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world impose additional measures, such as improving hygiene, installing thermal scans to check the temperatures of buyers, and canceling operations. According to estimates of the United Nations Economic Committee for Latin America, the recession caused by the wound could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than they would have suffered this situation without wound.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the around 300 million Chinese rural immigrant workers have been locked in their homes in the domestic provinces, or in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
Corona virus may cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate may reach 32%, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Closing in India has left tens of millions of Indian immigrant workers (who get wages through daily wages) unemployed. An investigation conducted by the Angus Red Institute found that 44% of Canadian families suffered some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they closed in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers submitted an application for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers submitted an application for a comprehensive credit plan.
France and Britain have adopted a short-term German work compensation plan.
The sector of theatrical arts and cultural heritage was deeply affected by the crisis, which affected the processes of organizations as well as individuals—workers and independent people—global.
The institutions of the art and culture sector have sought to support their mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, maintain the integrity of its employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, places of exhibition and other cultural institutions around the world will be closed unlimited, with their exhibitions, events, exhibitions cancelled or delayed.
In response, there were intense efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. among other recent accelerating effects of the disease, religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals, music concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows were cancelled.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Revelation season in the Great Post.
Many Bishops recommended the elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending the Mass on Sunday; some churches made the church services available via radio, live broadcast on the internet or TV while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Romanian Catholic Bishop’s closure of its churches and church mountains, and the evacuation of St. Peter’s Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and limited public assemblies in churches, mosques, Jewish church temples, temples, and Gordara.
The Ministry of Health of Iran has announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in areas affected by the explosion and the wounds have been closed, while Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims and their inhabitants from entering the holy places in Mecca and the city.
This disease caused the biggest disturbance in the World Sports Calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or delayed, including the Champions League 2019-20, the Champions League 2019-20, the European League 2020, the American Basketball Champions League 2019-20, and the National Hockey League 2019-20.
The explosion suspended the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was scheduled to start at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be scheduled again after 2020 but not later than in the summer of 2021".
This led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the new subscriptions rates; the entertainment industry was also affected by the suspension of different music groups or the cancellation of concert tours.
Many big theatres like those in Broadway suspended all the shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing the work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live shows or creating online “festivities” for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
The Internet has spread many internet memes about the coronavirus where many have turned into humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the Covid-19 eruption, extreme humiliation, hatred and racism of foreigners has been observed towards people of Chinese and Eastern Asian origin, and against people of hot foundation in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, doubt and hostility accidents have been observed in many countries, in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America, Asia and the Pacific.
The reports released in February (when most cases were still limited in China) recorded racist feelings expressed by various groups around the world towards Chinese that they deserve the virus or receive what is allegedly justified.
The anti-China feelings have also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei have discrimination due to their regional origin.
There was support for Chinese both online and outside, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the spread of the explosion in new hot centers, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COP19 explosion, may be suspicious and hated by foreigners. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a pressure proposal to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan #Twitter.
Chinese, as well as other Asian citizens in the UK and the U.S. have an increasing level of racist abuses, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus”, a term criticism considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who are evacuated from Wuhan to Novy Sanzari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares the border with China, who are studying in major Indian cities, face harassment due to the corona virus.
Bharatya Jantha, the leader of the party unity in West Bengal, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "this is why the Lord wins them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later denounced these statements, describing them as “fake.”In China, the shock led to increased hatred of foreigners and the practice of racism against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners were described as “foreign waste” and targeted “to get rid of them.”
Many newspapers have removed subscribed pages for some coverage for the corona virus or all of them.
Many scientific publishers have provided scientific papers related to explosion for open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

The practical test for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and the associated SARS-Cov-2 virus includes ways to detect the presence of the virus where the antibodies that produce a response to the infection are identified.
RT-BCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where the coronavirus’s DNA is detected.
This test is accurate and designed only for detection of SARS-COV-2 DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent cases of injury or active.
Anticorps detection is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Anticorps tests show the number of people who suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were so simple that they were unreported or who didn’t show any symptoms.
The exact death rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to the limitation of tests, no country in March 2020 had reliable data about the spread of the virus among its inhabitants.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant difference in the number of tests carried out by different countries.
This contrast is also likely to have a significant impact on the reports of death rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the momentary sequential polymerase reaction for reverse copies (RRT-BCR) can be examined for respiratory samples that are obtained in different ways, such as nasal bullying or bullying samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
It is not dependent on RT-BCR that is performed with the use of throat spray only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat then as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For the infected people who are undergoing the examination in the second week, instead, a sample of the deep respiratory pathways can be taken through a catheter or using a coughing substance (coughing).
One of the early BCR tests in Charite in Berlin was invented in January 2020 using the momentary sequential reversal polymerase reaction (RRT-BCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 tests distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech also invented a PowerChek Coronavirus team suitable for safe clinical use and relied on the PCR on 28 January 2020.
Looking for the gen "E" in which all the beta corona viruses and RdRp genes of SARS-COV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for the SARS-COV-2 detection team based on the PCR and in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the diagnosis panel of the new corona viruses 2019 (the new corona viruses 2019).
One of the three genetic tests in the old versions of the test crews resulted in irrespective results due to defective detectors, and one stage of the test was delayed compared to the other at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in the completion of a test of less than 100 samples a day in an average successfully throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not reliable until February 28, 2020, and until then government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under emergency use permission. U.S. commercial labs began to conduct tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, the Lab Corp announced the availability of the Covid-19 test throughout the country based on the RT-BCR.
Similarly, the Quest Diagnostica has been able to test Covid-19 throughout the country as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits have been announced; samples must be drawn and processed in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research invented and produced the Covid-19 test Victor.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Service for Health Monitoring registered the test. on 12 March 2020, May Clinicly developed a test to detect Covid-19. on 13 March 2020, Rosh Diagnostx received the approval of the Food and Drug Administration for a test that can be done within 3.5 hours on a large number, allowing one machine to perform 4128 tests over 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted the Emergency Use Authority (EEA) to the Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on the Abbott m2000 system; the Food and Drug Administration previously granted a similar authority to the Logic, the Abbott and the Thermomo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Shepherd received a similar emergency use permit from the Food and Drug Administration for an approximately 45-minute test.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test using the thermal-equal DNA amplification technology instead of the BCR.
Because this does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At the moment there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott is expected to increase manufacturing to carry out 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a single antibodies specifically linked to the new corona virus’s protein, hoping that it will be able to results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a quick flu test.
A review of the studies in March 2020 concluded that “the radiation of the chest with low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the CT results may be clear even before the symptoms appear.”
The usual characteristics that appear in the calculated scratch image on the two-sided scratch-covered glass spots include multi-sided scratches with a circular, non-equal and back distribution.
The spread under the spine develops and irregular spots appear and intensify with the development of the disease.
A study in Wuhan compared the PCR and computational screening in relation to the origin of the current injury found that computational screening is more sensitive than the PCR, although it is less accurate, with many of its visual characteristics interfering with pneumonia and other satisfactory stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiation Photography recommends “Do not use computer scan photography to detect Covid-19 or consider it a preliminary examination to diagnose the disease.” In March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for preliminary examination.
Part of the immune response to the infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect the infection of individuals within a period starting from 7 days or after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity capacity, and in the case of population monitoring.
High-performance mechanical systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but the extent of their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For central laboratories, one sample of the surrounding blood cells is usually used, although it is possible to use consecutive samples to track the immune response.
For clinical care point testing, one blood sample is usually taken through the skin hole.
On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration identified 29 entities who made a notification to the Agency according to the requirements and therefore these entities could distribute their own antibodies tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European credits for their test teams, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test achieves several hundred samples within hours and then it is much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of the virus-ribozy DNA.
The antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection.At the beginning of April, the UK discovered that the antibodies test teams they bought were not good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has developed a plan to allow suspicious patients to stay in their homes, "The emergency department gives a sample tube to patients," they stick in the tube and return it again to get the test result after a short period of time.The British National Health Service has announced that it is testing a plan to test suspicious cases in their homes, thus excluding the risk of infection from the suspicious when they arrive at the hospital or the need to sterilize the used ambulance.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors on 2 March stated that it was able to carry out about 12,000 tests per day for foreign patients and 10,700 people passed the test last week.
Health insurance will bear the costs if a doctor orders to perform the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of up to 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, the virus detection tests were made inside the car in many major cities.
On March 26, 2020 the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the results of the positive cases were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from the calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of the week 12/2020, with the results of 33,491 samples (6,9%) positively infected with SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers in TECHNOLOGY and RAMBAM HOSPITAL invented a method to examine samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and submitted that method to test, by collecting samples and not performing more tests only when the samples are positive.
With the supervision of BGI’s founder Wang Jian on the construction work and 5 days in it, the modeling processes showed that Hubei cases would have increased by 47% and the related health stone costs would double if the test capacity was not completed.
Wuhan Labs may follow the establishment of Huo-Yan Labs immediately in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and 12 cities in all over China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity reached 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1122 samples for a patient to detect Covid-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid processors.
In March, the lack of detectors and their insufficiency caused trouble when a large number of tests were carried out in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This led some experts to explore sampling protocols that included sampling at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release the DNA gene for further tests. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates was announced to be on the top of the world in terms of the percentage of the coronavirus test for its population, and it is on its way to raise the level of the test to the majority of the population.
This was through a combination of the vehicle’s testing capacity activation, and the acquisition of a population-suitable high-performance laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory was established within 14 days, with dozens of thousands of RT-BCR tests per day, and the world’s first laboratory of this size operating outside China.
Different methods of testing were invented targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic characteristics in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German plan for the crew industry that is sent to low-income countries that do not have resources to innovate their own crew.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. was not available until January 28, leading to a delay in available tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems related to the reliability of the test crews in the early explosion, and these two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient crews to meet the demand and follow the recommendations for testing by health experts.
In return, experts said the abundance of tests in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the new corona virus.
The South Korean government has significantly strengthened its test capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called on to intensify the test programs as the optimal solution to reduce the progression of Covid-19.The increased demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, as well as the supply of scanners and chemical detectors.
In March 2020, China that there were problems with the accuracy of its test crews.
In the United States, "defects" were found in the test crews invented by the CDC; then the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test in particular. and Spain bought the test crews from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Limited, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failing to collect samples or failing to use the crew properly.
The Spanish ministry has stated that it will withdraw from the purchase of crews that gave incorrect results, and will replace them with other test crews from Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test crews purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results.
The Prime Minister Matovich proposed to throw it into the Danube River.Turkish Ministry's Prof. Acha Karah that the test crews purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and "prohibited their use."The UK also bought 3.5 million test crews from China but at the beginning of April 2020 announced they were unable to use.
Tests, followed by a healthy stone for those who have been shown to be affected and followed by those who mixed with the SARS-COV-2, resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which saw the first case of death in Covid-19 in Italy, conducted tests on the entire population of approximately 3,400 people twice, taking about ten days each.
No symptoms were shown in half of people whose results were positive, and all the cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between cities, new injuries were completely eliminated.
The Corona 2020 in Singapore has seen a significant decrease in its spread rates compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities, through strict tracking of the interceptors and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, tests and health stones.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun to encourage the population to stay in their homes on March 28, but schools have been reopened on March 23 at the time after the holidays have ended.
Several other countries have also controlled this disease by strict tracking the interceptors and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, tests and health stones, but with less strict closing decisions, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that conducted more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, because these countries are more able to detect people with only mild symptoms or without any symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have the ability to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 COVID-accredited laboratories to confirm the test.
Among the 16 certified laboratories, there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "positive percentage of tests" column is affected by the policy of the state in conducting the test.
The country in which tests are carried out for persons transferred only to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive cases than the country in which tests are carried out for all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, considering the equivalent of other factors.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand cleansing, is a process of hand cleansing in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap continuously at certain “necessary times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral oral pathway.
People may also have respiratory diseases such as flu or scratch, for example, if they do not wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous membranes).
The five necessary moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important: before and after swallowing, after cleaning the back of the child or changing the pants, before feeding the child, before eating, before preparing, or treating meat, fish, or raw poultry and afterwards.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with gray.WHO recommends handwashing:
Before, before, before and after the meal.
Care for a sick person and afterwards.
After changing the babysitters or cleaning it after using it for the bathroom.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or swelling.
After touching animals, their feed, or their waste.
Medical hygiene of the hands refers to health hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for the general individual.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, prevention of diarrhotic infectious diseases, and reducing cases of respiratory infections.
Reduce the mortality rate of infants at birth at home.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing practices may lead to slight improvements in length growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child death rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by 50%.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhoea attacks by a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of decreased diarrhoea attacks can be associated with handwashing with soap. handwashing with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and severe respiratory infections (ARE) when automatic behavior is applied in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Lung inflammation, one of the main severe respiratory infections, is the first cause of death among children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause approximately 3.5 million deaths per year.
Conversion of hand washing with soap before meals and after the use of the toilet into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing the deaths caused by diarrhea by half, and the deaths caused by severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and sanitation programs (water, sanitation and sanitation).
The handwashing also protects from spotting that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
The simple harmful effect of washing the hands is that frequent washing the hands can cause damage to the skin due to its dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive handwashing can lead to a skin condition of scratch and swelling known as hand eczema or hand skin inflammation, which is common among health care professionals.
The washing of hands is also often considered more than should be one of the symptoms of compulsory obsession disorder (OCD).
There are five necessary moments during the day in which handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral pathway: after the use of the bath (urine, expression), after the cleaning of the baby’s back (changing the pants), before the baby’s feeding, before the meal, before/after the preparation of food, or the treatment of meat, fish or raw poultry.
The right handwashing method should be practiced in other cases to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after treatment of cuts, wounds or after, after swallowing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap decreases.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of families wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate and is estimated to be 97 per cent, the U.S. is approaching the center by 77 per cent, and in China with the lowest rate of 23 per cent. Now there are many behavioral change methods to increase the benefit of handwashing behavior with soap at times necessary.
The “Basic Health Care Program” implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of taking broad measures to promote children’s health and education.
The worm treatment takes place twice a year, as well as daily handwashing with soap, and daily tooth cleaning with fluoride, the core of this national program.
It is also successful in Indonesia.
Adding soap or cleaners to water enhances the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and cleaners is to reduce the disintegration obstacles, and increase the dissolvence.
Water alone is an ineffective detergent for the skin because fat and proteins, organic soil components, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the flow of adequate amount of water helps to clean up.
The steel soap, due to its re-use nature, may carry the bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed the bacterial transition from polluted soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because the bacteria are washed with dirt.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still stated that “the use of liquid soap is better than the use of untouched devices to pump soap.”
Antibacterial soap is highly recommended for health-interested consumers.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of recommended cleansers or sterilizers is selected to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial factors such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of species of living organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect anti-biotic resistant races, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
In addition to surface stress reducer and skin protection factor, advanced compounds may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid organizer, anti-microbatic and other skin moisturizers (sugar, vitamins, meltol, vegetable extracts).A comprehensive analysis conducted by the College of General Health of the University of Oregon pointed out that ordinary soap is as effective as anti-bacterial soap of the consumer class that contains triclosan in the prevention of diseases and removal of bacteria.
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at a body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, hot water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Unlike the common belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microbial pregnancy on the hands.
Hand detergent or hand sterilizer is a non-water-based material for hand cleaning.
In the late 1990s and early the 21st century, alcoholic hand cleansers that are not water-based and sterilized through the brick (also known as an installed hand wipes, or hand wipes or hand sterilizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of them are dependent on isopropyl or ethanol alcohol combined with a heating factor such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in liquid, or a dust for easy use and reducing the effect of drying caused by alcohol.
Adding reduced hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. hand sterilizers containing alcohol at least 60 to 95% are effectively bacterial antibodies.
Alcoholic sterilizers through the scratch eliminate bacteria, medication-resistant multi-bacteria (Golden Globe-resistant methylene and pancomycin-resistant intestinal bacteria), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell viruses, nasal viruses, tuberculosis, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% of alcohol through the scratch eliminate 99.97% (Logarithmic reduction of 3.5%, similar to Disable reduction of 35) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of their position and 99.99% to 99.999% (Logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of their position.
Alcoholic hand sterilizers are almost completely ineffective against neurovirus (or norwalk) viruses, which is the most common cause of stomach and intestinal inflammation caused by infection. sufficient manual cleanser or alcohol spray should be used to moist or cover both hands completely.
The front and rear parts of the hands and between all fingers and ends are washed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, dust, or gel are dry.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a hand sterilizer, especially when the hands are clearly tightened.
The increasing use of these cleansers is due to its ease of use and its rapid activity in the elimination of microbials; however, it should not be an alternative to the right handwashing unless water and soap are available.
Repeated use of alcoholic hand sterilizers can cause skin drying unless the moisturizers, skin moisturizers or both are added to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on the drying of the skin can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin or other fertilizers or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcoholic hand sterilizers containing flavors cause fewer irritation and drying of the skin than soap or antimicrobial cleansers.
Rarely allergic thyroid skin inflammation, thyroid malignity syndrome, hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives contained in alkaline handwashers occurs.
The decrease in susceptibility of inflammation has become an attractive factor compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite the effectiveness of non-water-based cleansers, they do not clean the hands from organic materials, but they simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sterilizers are not effective like soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, where the pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of the alcohol-free hand sterilizer is largely dependent on the ingredients and composition, and historically its effect was significantly lower than that of the alcohol-free hand sterilizer, which is dependent on the alcohol breakdown.
Recently, the compounds that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and continuous effect as an antimicrobial after use, unlike alcohol which has been shown to have a low effectiveness after repeated use, due to gradual reverse skin interactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
The pot or soil may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
The grain, like the soap, is a purifier because it forms an alkaline solution when it touches the water.
The World Health Organization has recommended the use of cave or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The right handwashing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold flowing water.
It is recommended to use flowing water because the existing pools may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Make a rubber on your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of water.
Smooth for at least 20 seconds.
It creates a compression, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, and removes the compression for longer periods of more bacteria.
Wash well under flowing water.
Washing the hands inside the basin may lead to reinfection.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
The wet and moist hands are easily exposed to contamination again. The most common parts that are ignored are the fingers, the fingers, the areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Industrial nails and broken nails paint may contain precise organisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizer to prevent the drying of the hands, the drying of the skin can cause damage, which may increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be provided to facilitate handwashing in developing countries, where no water or soap or both are available, such as throwing water from an attached bowl or sliding the appropriate holes and/or using the cave if necessary. in places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to racionalize water consumption, such as the "Tibet Moisture" and other low-cost options.
The TIPE is a simple technology that uses a wire-wrapped stick, a foot-working control arm to throw a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand cleaning process, but there are some controversies about the most effective form of drying in public water cycles.
An increasing number of research suggests that paper gloves are more healthy than electrical hand dryers found in many water cycles.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Seminar for the Paper Toilet Industry, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and the latest wind-air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to rise by an average of 194 percent on the bottom of the fingers and 254 percent on the rest of the hands.
Drying using a fluid air dryer resulted in an average total number of bacteria on the bottom of the fingers increased by 42% and the rest of the hand by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, the average total number of bacteria on the underfinger decreased by up to 76 per cent and the rest of the hand by 77 per cent, and scientists conducted tests to determine whether there is a possibility of infection to other water cycle users and the water cycle environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The fluid air dryer, which pushes the air out of the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 m/h), is able to swallow the microbials from the hands and the device, and the infection may be transmitted to other water cycle users and the water cycle environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air dryer displays microbials at a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper gloves did not show a large spread of microbials.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated the various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers are co-worked with paper towels.
Washing hands with hand sterilization towels is an alternative during travel due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sterilizers should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The medical handwashing has become mandatory for a long time after the Hungarian doctor Agnes Seymelvis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind the hospital staff of washing their hands if they forget.
One study found a low rate of infection by using it.
The medical hand washing should be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make a rubber and wash each part of the hand.
The hands should be wrapped together and the fingers connected.
If there are waste under the fingers, a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since the bacteria may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any output door if necessary).
This avoids hand contamination again from those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing at the health care site is to remove the pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transfer.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that nonwashing hands remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routine before touching patients, which transports microbials.
One study showed that handwashing properly and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catarral-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a newspaper that describes how to wash hands and wash them in the healthcare sectors.
The project of the Hand Cleaning Guidelines document presented by the Organization can also be found on its site available to the public to comment on it.
He and the others have done a related review.
Commercial equipment can measure and verify the cleanliness of the hands if it requires proof of compliance with the regulatory rules.
The World Health Organization has five “minutes” to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to the mission, and
After patient care, adding disinfected chemicals to the soap (“medical” or “antimicrobial”) adds a pesticide to the handwashing agent.
This eliminating element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widely spread. When someone's hands are "fried" for surgery, it is necessary to provide a spoon that can be operated and stopped without touching the hands, some chlorhexide or iodine washers, sterile handbags for drying the hands after washing, a sterile brush for fried, and another sterile tool for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of the hands and the helpers to the foam, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
The length of duration (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing, water should be prevented from returning from the assistants to the hands.
After the hand was washed, the hand was dried with a sterilized piece of clothes and clothed with a surgical dress.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash hands or use a hand detergent before taking care of a sick person and afterwards.
To control the bacterial infection in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and it gained a very small additional benefit when the repetition of hand cleansing increased to more than 35%.
Ordinary soap washes more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases that are transmitted to food than antibacterial soap washes.In comparison with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol washing reduces bacterial pollution by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than steel handwashing to reduce the type A H1N1 influenza virus and hard handwashing. Measures for improving hand cleansing in health care sites may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing the availability of steel handwashing, and written and oral reminders to employees.
There is a need for further research to find out which of these measures is the most effective in different health care locations.
In developing countries, there is a confession that handwashing with soap is a basic and affordable tool for achieving good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find handwashes near each private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashes.
However, low hands washing rates can be caused by indigenous habits instead of the lack of soap or water.
Promotion of handwashing with soap and calling for it can affect political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a long-term change in the behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that the community approach is effective in increasing handwashing in middle-income countries than the lowest branch, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" designed by UNESCO to encourage schools to take simple and non-cost steps to ensure students are washing their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one star to up to three stars in the end.
Building handswashes can be part of handswashing campaigns to reduce diseases and child deaths.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaigns that try to change behavior. due to the 2019-20 coronavirus, UNESCO has encouraged to adopt a handwashing expression code.
Few studies have looked at the effectiveness of the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries and their relationship with age-modified by disability.
However, one review shows that promoting handwashing with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of handwashing for human health was first recognized in the mid-19th century – especially for people who suffer from critical conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – by two pioneers of handwashing: the Hungarian doctor Agnes Siemelvis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the English Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
Most people at that time were still believing that the infection was caused by an unpleasant odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food and healthcare-related infections have led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand cleansing more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
Swine flu in 2009 and Covid-19 in 2020 have raised the awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, labels containing “the right ways to wash hands” were hanged next to the handwashes in public toilets and to the toilets of the office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands from" means an announcement of the unwillingness of a person to take responsibility for a thing or participate in communion with it.
It is derived from a paragraph in the Bible in the time when the Pentecostal Pilate washed his hands from the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of its much wider use in some English communities.
In the play of McCarthy for Shakespeare, Mrs. McCarthy begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to clean up a piece of fantasy that represents her feeling guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after referring to or thinking about unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more than others, and tend to appreciate handwashing tools more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “cleaning” compensation procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe handwashing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water without soap for handwashing, is part of handwashing rituals that have appeared in many religions, including the Bahá’u’lláh, the Hindu, the Philadelphia, the handwashing in Judaism, the washing in Christianity and the lighting in Islam. Religions also impose handwashing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam require handwashing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jewishism and Islam requires handwashing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls at Workplace
COVID-19 risk controls at work include the implementation of professional safety and health methodologies for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The correct controls for risk control at work are based on the workplace and the functional task, based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the seriousness of the disease in society, and the risk factors that threaten workers who may be exposed to COPD-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OHSHA), low-risk business involves a minimum of communication with the public and other employers, a situation in which it is recommended to apply basic preventive measures, including washing hands and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account the custody of cough and sweat, andining the usual practices of cleaning and cleaning the work environment.
Intermediate exposure risks include those that require frequent or close communication with unknown persons who are infected or suspected of COPD, but may be infected due to the continued transmission of the infection in the community or international travel.
This includes employees who have communicated with the public as in schools, work environments with high labour density, and some large-scale retail stations.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, fracturalization barriers, and the use of personal prevention equipment available in case of dealing with a person infected with COVID-19.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health shall consider health care workers and the portfolio of the bodies of the dead who are exposed to a known person or suspects of a COVID-19 exposure to a high level of risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to a very high level if the workers are engaged in the implementation of aerodynamic procedures, or collect or handling samples of a known person or suspects of a COVID-19 exposure.
Suitable controls for the risk control of these employees include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal prevention equipment suitable for the functional task.
Covid-19 eruptions may have multiple effects on the workplace.
Workers may disappear due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods required and the way to get them (such as shopping in non-top hours or through delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipping of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19.The prevention and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and functional tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors that arise from home and community places, and risk factors for individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
It also defines the controls necessary to address these risks, and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the disease's spread.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may be subject to national and non-national recommendations.
The response to the disease spread targets include the reduction of the transmission of infection among staff, the protection of people most likely to be at risk of negative health complications, the maintenance of business processes, and the reduction of the negative effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which business is affected affects the responses taken.
The hierarchical sequence of risk controls is a work framework widely used in the field of occupational safety and health to classify risk controls according to effectiveness.
Since the COVID-19 risks are unable to be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protection equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on workers’ behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policy or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal Protection Equipment (PBI) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposure sites.
All types of personal preventive equipment must be selected based on the risk that the worker is exposed, the correct suitability as necessary (such as respiratory devices), the constant and correct wear, the regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, the removal, cleaning, storage, or the correct removal to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OHSHA), jobs that include less risk involve a minimum of communication with the public and other employers.
Basic measures for the prevention of the recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and complete handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account the morals of coughing and swallowing, including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and swallowing, providing paper towels and rubber containers, preparing to work on a distance or organizing work attacks successively if necessary, while workers do not use other tools and equipment, andining the routine cleaning and cleaning of the work environment.
Immediate identification of persons who are likely to be infected and isolated is a crucial step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory diseases remain at home until fever, fever signs and any other symptoms disappear for at least 24 hours without the use of fever remedies or other symptoms enhancing medications, that the policy of ill-residence is flexible, that employees are allowed to stay at home to take care of one of the sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to the Management of Occupational Safety and Health, jobs with an average exposure risk include those that require repeated or close communication within a six-foot distance (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected individuals with Covid-19, but may have Covid-2 due to the continuous transmission of the infection in the community surrounding the workplace, or due to the person's recent international journey to a site where Covid-19 is spread.
This includes workers who interfere with the public as in schools, high-density working environments, and some large-scale retail stations. engineering controls and high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of material barriers such as transparent plastic shock protectors, the installation of windows for the service of customers who shop without leaving the car. Administrative controls and high-risk groups include encouraging workers to stay at home, the replacement of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-efficiency air filters, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups, the establishment of high-risk groups,
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory devices.
If the person becomes sick and is on the plane, appropriate preventive controls to protect workers and other passengers include removing the sick passenger from others at a distance of 6 feet, commissioning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his mouth and his nose with paper towels when cough or swallow.
The crew must wear medical gloves that can be removed when dealing with a sick passenger, touching the body fluids or polluted surfaces, and may use additional personal protection equipment if the sick passenger has fever, constant cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other objects that can be removed in the bio-risk prevention bag must be removed, and the polluted surfaces must be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. for commercial ships, including tourist ships and other passenger ships, risk control regulations include travel delay when ill, self-isolation and inform the medical center on the plane immediately if one person has fever or other symptoms while on the plane.
For schools and child care facilities, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends short-term closure for cleaning or cleaning if the infected person is in the school building regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is a limit to the transmission of infection in society ranging from limited to medium, social distinction strategies can be implemented such as the cancellation of field trips, meetings, and other large meetings such as physical education lessons, music bands lessons or eating in the bomb, increasing the distances between offices, organizing consecutive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with symptoms similar to the symptoms of influenza.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the local community, in addition to social distinction strategies, the extension of school departure dates can be taken into account. For law enforcement staff who do routine daily activities, the direct health risks are considered low by the disease control center.
The law enforcement officials who have to contact persons who have been confirmed or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines that are followed by medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protection equipment.
In case of direct contact during detention, workers should clean and clean the bands and work tools before re-use using a spray or home cleaning spray, follow the standard work procedures to cope with pollution, remove the personal preventive equipment used, collect and wash clothes.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health considers that some health care workers and the body portfolio are among the categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients known or suspected of having COPD-19.
These levels of risk become extremely high if the staff performs aerospace production procedures, as well as samples from patients who are confirmed or suspected of having or treating COVID-19.
Procedures of atmospheric pollution include pollution, cough-stimulating procedures, neuropathy, and some procedures and tests related to dentistry, or the collection of invasive samples.
High-risk mortal bodies portfolio functions include workers who participate in the preparation of the bodies of two persons who are confirmed or suspected of having Covid-19 at the time of their death; those with a very high level of risk becomes if they have performed a body diagnosis. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected of having Covid-19, including when carrying out aerospace production procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some places of health care and the preservation of the dead bodies.
The samples must be treated following the biological safety precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the isolation of patients coming in separate waiting areas on the basis of whether they are suspected of having Covid-19 or not. In addition to other personal prevention equipment, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of respiratory devices for those who work 6 feet away from known or suspected patients with Covid-2 and those who are carrying out aerodynamics procedures.
In the United States, facial masks with a N95 type candidate, approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, should be used in the context of the comprehensive written respiratory system protection program, which includes the installation, suitability, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide greater protection and improve the level of comfort of the workers. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of antagonists, because Covid-19 is a respiratory disease instead of being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the examination staff at the entrance point.
For those who collect, take care of, or carry respiratory samples from Covid-19 patients without any measures to generate air pollution, the World Health Organization recommends use of surgical masks, protective glasses, or face protectors, and gloves and gloves.
If an atmospheric fluid generation is performed, the face mask is replaced with the N95 or FFP2 breathing mask.
Given the global supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends reducing the need for personal prevention equipment through remote therapy, and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those participants in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using the personal prevention equipment only necessary for the specified task, and continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it while taking care of many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal prevention equipment, and avoiding the use of non-symptomatic patients.

We found ourselves in the middle of exceptional circumstances this month.
The Covid 19 epidemic has become a clear demonstration of the global humanitarian interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never experienced similar challenges at all, but we know with certainty that the best response depends on a kind of global sympathy, cooperation and community building, which are the elements founded in the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, calls and conversations is an amazing practical proof of the amazing human emotions surrounding, fortunately, our way of business.
I am deeply grateful and proud to be your true friends.
Last week, someone sent me a letter to express appreciation for our work.
It reminded me of the great importance of the world’s ability to move towards Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism of the remaining of this important resource available online and a kiss available to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it is by continuing the work of the sites, getting our colleagues on wages, or providing security for our communities.
The world needs more information available on Wikipedia than ever.
It is a moment when the positive impact in the world is not limited to the efforts we do, but also the way we do it.
Due to the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make significant changes in how we work together starting next week.
Modification of working methods and timetables
As Robin previously mentioned, the C team met yesterday to discuss our way and our timetable for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we saw could be an appropriate response to what we face, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the organization’s business during this period.
We were very enthusiastic to get rid of nervous stress and stress, and to support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce the burden and tasks, it’s okay.
All employees, contractors and contractors:
The expected daily work period is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until another notification.
We are not about to announce a vacation, so if you are able to work longer than usual working hours, you may add your efforts to the task.
However, the situation in the world has become unpredictable today, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get goods from the store or go to a doctor, your safety is our most important priority.
We do not follow your time.
If you’re sick, don’t work.
It should be understood to allow this without expressing it, but we confirm it.
You don’t need to get satisfactory holidays or paid holidays, you just need to inform your manager and help your team review calendar and timetables to make sure the main business areas are covered.
(If your doctor has a positive diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, please tell Brian in the Training and Certificate Management so that the Training and Certificate Assistant Management can provide support and make sure your condition is given adequate care from the Management).
Workers who work an hour receive their full wages.
We have already mentioned that, and we renew this commitment to our commitments to our contractors with us and our colleagues of the hourworkers.
Each employee will receive his salary based on the usual working hours during the usual circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many individuals use work to overcome the spread pressure in the world around us.
What we can do will be fruitful in an amazing way, especially during such difficult times.
Again, it’s about taking care of the person for himself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that he can know what to expect and modify the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things we need to keep on.
The site reliability engineering teams, human resources processes, trust, confidentiality and donation collection (and others) are doing an extremely important job, which may require more support.
We will start a process in collaboration with all departments to evaluate current goals and turn our focus on supporting the elements necessary to our mission.
There is a lot of work that we all have to do, and we will focus only on the most important projects.
Going slowly now will not hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double work time to manage what’s lost” after the break ends.
We are not expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and timetables when it becomes appropriate.
What Happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and daily working hours forecasts, we intend to modify the delivery schedule for our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budgeting to allow employees to arrange the priority of the important work, self-care and care of loved ones with the condition of those who need to work within a reduced or desired working hours schedule, within the next few weeks.
This extension on the schedule relieves the current planning work burden and pressure across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and will inform the representatives and teams of the updates regarding the following steps as soon as confirmation is obtained.
We thank the Annual Planning Team for the leading role in this matter.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been infected with the Covid-19 virus.
However, starting with caution and massive blockade, we employed an antivirus cleaning team to clean all surfaces at the San Francisco office.
The team may use a virus resistant solution of the degree used in hospitals to clean all surfaces, as well as corridor and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building applied its care duty protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable because the office has become conveniently ready until we decide to return to work.
Our office in Washington D.C. is located in a building of the W.W.R.C., which has shared us with its COVID-19 protocol and with all members of the team at our headquarters in Washington D.C.
Starting last week, our office in Washington DC moved to a completely remote place according to the joint guidelines with our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues know at our headquarters in New York, we have been discussing a place rental in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for a while.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working on a distance for a long time know that it may be an amendment and have wanted to give you some advice:
The time of meetings should be determined to extend for a maximum of one hour or gradually increasing to two hours.
If it requires to hold longer sessions, you should consider how to divide them into several days.
The meeting should be clearly determined, the agenda should be prepared, and the materials dedicated to reading should be sent in advance.
Video should be a default solution, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
The initiative should facilitate each meeting, and the person to monitor the conversation to find questions and track the list of speakers, and the other person to help record notes (or carry out the process of recording collaborative notes).
A e-mail should be sent to technical support when it is necessary for comfortable headphones.
The health and safety compensation program can be used to get the cost of light foods.
You can join the #remoties channel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The Human Resource Processing Team is looking for guidelines for user-friendly elements based on online meetings, to support the increase in the business distributed through our organization.
During the last week, we asked all community granters to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Editathon website editors, until the World Health Organization announced the end of the disease.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make completion of agreed grant activities impossible, and that no penalty will be imposed on anyone for the need to delay or modify these targets.
Next week we will issue additional follow-up guidelines on Wikipedia and other regional community conferences with specific topics.
The general feelings that dominate the global community are intertwined between sadness due to disorder, satisfaction for clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the light of the progress in these actions, the Crisis Response Team is developing a page on the Meta Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and track all communications with it.
Stay informed about the topics related to Covid-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, at 14:00 GMT, 07:00 GMT Pacific Zone for the staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating with us.
We do this experience together and are always ready to provide help as much as possible.
Within that time, we may continue to obtain information from this e-mail and all other necessary information related to Covid-19 available in Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep providing these pages with updates and keep all information in one place.
We also work to keep regular contacts with workers residing in the highly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need to help about it, please do not hesitate to inform us and collaborate with the crisis response team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication if necessary.
If you have any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an email to Brian Gordon, Director of International Human Resources Operations.
Any modification of these changes may not be considered a dismissal of the work or obligations that are on us.
Instead, it is conscious at this moment, our work and commitments are likely to need to adapt to the situation in a way that we have not promised in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so we can continue to work, provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they rely on.
The work we have planned to accomplish will be waiting for us when it is time to accomplish it.
Now, it’s time for each person to help each other and to create a space for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We all need you to this, so we all need you to take care of yourself and your families to be in your best condition when your efforts are needed.
Please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Catherine, Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Renate M, Tony S), and the other members of the Crisis Response Team (Grandt A, Heather W, Jimmy V, Jean Y, Lisa S, Ruben A, Rani M, and Toni N).
The angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is linked to the external surface (cellular membranes) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, column, as well as the intestines.
The Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 counteracts the work of the Angiotensin Converter Enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of Angiotensin 2 and increasing Angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is known as a metal enzyme containing a zinc element and is located on the surface of cells and other cells.
Protein enzyme converter to angiotensin 2 contains peptidase M2 range has an amino end, and a cholectrin carboxyl end carrier to kidney amino acids.
Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 is a type 1 single-transmitter membrane protein, which has active enzyme receptors present on the surface of lungs and other tissues.
The outer part of the cell range of the angiotensin converter enzyme 2 is separated from the membrane range by an enzyme called shidaz, resulting in the release of a soluble protein in the bloodstream and then out through the urine.
The angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is linked to the cell membrane of type 2 genetic cells in the lungs, in the intestinal cells of the microcream, in the bacterial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The angiotensin-transforming enzyme transmitter of the ribose DNA is found in the cortex of the brain, the placebo, the submarine area, and the brain.
The basic function of Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 is to work as an equilibrium of Angiotensin Converter Enzyme.
The angiotensin converter enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 that holds the blood vessels.
In contrast, the Enzyme Converter of Angiotensin 2 part carboxyl containing Amino Acid Vennel Alanin is separated from Angiotensin 2 (Aspartite-Arginine-Valine-Tyrosine-Isolosine-Hestedine-Proline-Vennel Alanin) and is analyzed by a converter to Angiotensin (1-7) (Hestedine-Aspartite-Arginine-Valine-Tyrosine-Isolosine-Hestedine-Proline-Vennel Alanin).
The Enzyme Converter of Angiotensin 2 is divided into a number of other peptides [Dis-Arginine9] -Bradricine, Apline, Neurotensin, Deanorphine, and Glenn.
The angiotensin-transforming enzyme also regulates the mucous pathway of the SLC6A19-balanced amino acid-neutral carrier, and also plays a role in Hartenb disease.
The enzyme converter to angiotensin 2, as a mucous protein, is the main entrance to the cells of some coronary viruses, including human corona virus NL63, SARS COV (the virus that causes the SARS), and SARS COV-2 (the virus that causes the COVID-19).
Specifically, the spike S1 protein of SARS COV and SARS COV-2 connects with the enzyme range of angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 on the surface of the cells to cellular mutation and the transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This process of introduction requires the preparation of protein S by a protease enzyme through the membrane, the host's serin2, which is still inhibited as a potential therapy. This makes some assume that the reduction of the levels of the enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 in the cells may help to resist the infection.
In any case, many specialized associations and self-regulating bodies recommend continuing the use of conventional angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blocks as a treatment.
A systematic study and follow-up analysis published on July 11, 2012 revealed that “the use of angiotensin-transforming enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group.”
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia was reduced among those who received angiotensin-transforming enzyme inhibitors, who were more likely to develop pneumonia, especially those who suffer from stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-transforming enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in mortality due to pneumonia, although the results were less powerful than the general risk of pneumonia.”
It is believed that the humane angiotensin 2 converter enzyme (rhACE2) will be a new remedy for severe lungs injuries, it has been found to improve the lung blood distribution process as well as the oxygen saturation in pigs with severe respiratory difficulty syndrome triggered by many fatty sugar.
The half-life of the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while its work begins after 30 minutes, as well as its effectiveness continues (time period) up to 24 hours.
There are a lot of evidence that the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme may be a promising treatment for those with the intolerance of the traditional angiotensin rhinosystems inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and diseases accompanied by an increase in angiotensin 2 in the blood. There are clinical trials being evaluated, on the effect of the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme pumping in the treatment of the acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software app specially designed to help track people who are infected as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus, which means the process of identifying people ("infected people") who may have been infected by a person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdiction areas.
Several work frameworks have been set up to design applications for tracking interceptors.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on the geographical location tracking of applications users.
The less confidential alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to register close to the user from other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they could integrate a function that supports these Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has published an app that allows citizens to check whether they’ve mixed people with Covid-19 or not.
It is an application used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. in Singapore, individuals use an application called TraceTogether.
The local information technology association has taken over the design of the app and released it as an open source app and is scheduled to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched the app "!StopKorona", a app based on the use of Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially affected individuals and provide quick response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology has taken over the design of the application in cooperation with the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and App Store from Apple.
On April 12, the government that the mixer tracking app was in advanced development and could become available for distribution within weeks.Irland and France are planning to launch a similar app, which is ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are thinking about designing applications based on the TraceTogether app launched by Singapore, as well as the Blue Trace Protocol.Russia plans to launch an application that uses the virtual geographical ocean for patients who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 from Moscow residents, which is designed to make sure they don’t leave the home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding app-based systems, including false positive cases and potential failure if the use of applications is limited to a small sector of the population.
To deal with the concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious Corona viruses, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that may add corona-related applications to its own app store, shortening it only to “official” or other well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates may have expressed concerns about the consequences of the collective monitoring resulting from the use of corona viruses applications, in particular whether the monitoring infrastructure designed to deal with corona viruses will disappear as soon as the threat expires.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
The monitoring should be "legal, necessary and appropriate";
Extensions to monitoring and monitoring should include clauses relating to the determination of the time of their termination;
The use of data should be limited to purposes related to COVID-19.
The data security and the identity of its owners should be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital monitoring should avoid increased discrimination and marginalization.
Any data sharing with third parties should be determined in the law;
Factors of protection against abuse and protection of citizens' rights should be provided to combat abuse processes;
"Efficient participation" is required from all "interested stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Without Borders (RSF) have also issued review lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating systems as soon as it is needed.
Some countries have used web-based web tracking instead of using apps, eliminating each of the need to download the app and allowing the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials applied network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to the initial data of the site involve potential major privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need access to personal site data; a number of privacy preservation systems have been created that only use centralized servers for internal communications (see the following section below).
In South Korea, officials used an unapplication-based system to track interceptors.
Instead of using a custom app, the system collects tracking information from different sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and these data include to send notifications through text messages to individuals with potential infection.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential interceptors, the government has also made the site information publicly available, which it has allowed due to extensive changes to the information privacy laws after the corona virus that causes the Middle East respiratory syndrome in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.States, including Germany, have reviewed the use of both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
On April 6, 2020, the details of this issue have not yet been published.
The Privacy Defenders Track is an applied, successful and supported by a strong research work that dates back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts have accessed privacy-compatible solutions, such as Bluetooth Low-Energy (PLE) to record the user close to other mobile phones.
However, the IPB-BT was a coordinating effort that contained both the centralized and decentralized approaches, not a individual protocol. The decentralized protocols include the privacy-reserved decentralized approach tracking (DPB/DPT-3T), the temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as the events numbers, CEN), the privacy sensitive protocols, and the mobile tracking mechanisms (IPT) and so on.
In these protocols, personal IDs do not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
The MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group was working on the development of SafePaths, a platform for using privacy technologies when collecting or crossing tracks and using them to track the spread of Covid-19.
Based on the research resulting from the March 2020 report “The Evil Face of Applications: Keeping Personal Privacy Under Epidemic” and the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy-related technology developer that was also originally established at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share site and sensitive health data with users and other officials without damaging data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Communicator Numbers Tracking Coalition was established by groups focused on what was basically similar approach and significantly interconnected protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and enabling global exchange between tracking and warning applications, which is a key feature of widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has made the Blue Trace Protocol, which is used by the official government application, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track interruptors, claiming that they will maintain privacy by combining low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-reserved encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to bring the system into three stages:
Developing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-reserved applications for corona virus tracking
Integrate this function directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve problems of use and continuous monitoring by distributing systems first through operating system updates and then by removing them in the same way as the threat is over.
The re-use of the drug (also known as re-use, re-adjustment, change of purpose or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is the re-use of a certified drug for the treatment of a different disease or a different medical condition than it was originally designed for its treatment.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for Covid-19.
Other research trends include the development of the Covid-19 vaccine and plasma transmission.Sars Cov-2 contains 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which contains multiple sites linked to the connectors.
The analysis of these sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective anti-virus drug that eliminates Covid-19 proteins.
Among the targeted proteins of SARS KOV-2 very important are PAPIN-like proteins, RIBOSY DNA polymerates based on RIBOSY DNA, Helicazes, Protein S, and RIBOSY FOSFATAS for DINUSIN BIO FOSFATES.
Hussein A.A. and others have studied many candidate compounds that have subsequently been improved and analyzed for their structure similarity with highest similarity accredited drugs with the aim of accelerating the development of a powerful anti-SARS COV-2 drug in his pre-clinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Chlorokin is a drug for malaria that doctors also use to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chlorokine and hydroxy chlorokine associated could be among the four under-study drugs as part of the clinical solidarity experiment.
New York Governor Andrew Komo has announced that New York State tests on Chlorokine and Hydroxy Chlorokine may start on 24 March.On 28 March, the Food and Drug Administration has announced using Hydroxy Chlorokine Sulfate and Chlorokine Phosphate under Emergency Use License (EUA).
The treatment was not approved by the clinical trials of the Food and Drug Administration and was licensed under the license for use only in emergency cases as a experimental therapy for emergency use for the treatment of patients who have entered the hospital but cannot be treated in the clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it was not yet determined "the use of hydroxy chlorokin to prevent SARS KOV-2 infection, its treatment, doses or period."
Doctors said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently doing a small study on the use of chlorine as well as zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at the Duke University and Oxford University.
The Langon Medical School of the University of New York is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxy chlorokin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Fabifer was “clearly effective.”
Of 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative in an average of 4 days, while the period of the disease reached 11 days in 45 patients not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given Vefiberafer and the other half were given Omefenovafer.
The Italian Medicine Agency has people that the substance supported evidence is deficient and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will buy the drug from Japan to add it to its reserves, and the army will use it to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat Covid-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Newspaper, Shinzo Abe has conducted preliminary talks with the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study that used Lupinavir/Ritonavir (Calitra), an antiviral compound of Lupinavir and Ritonavir, that the results “no observed any benefit.”
The drugs were designed to suppress the HIV virus to prevent copying it from linking to the protein.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to reach a compound associated with SARS COV-2 and the scientific community is witnessing a state of criticism about directing resources to re-identifying the purposes of the drugs specially designed for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has added Lupinaver/Ritonaver to the International Solidarity Experience.
Gilead Sciences has developed Remedicifer as a remedy for Ebola and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has then discovered that Remedicifer has an antivirus activity in the laboratory against many linear viruses, mucous viruses and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious and transmitted diseases.
Some early pre-clinical studies indicate that Remedicifer may have a high genetic obstacle to resistance.There are many current clinical trials, including two trials carried out by Cleveland University Hospitals; one is around the middle and the other is intended for the most severe patients.
There are three clinical trials on antiviral vitamin C on patients who have been hospitalized and have a severe disease caused by Covid-19, as well as two controlled trials using the false drug (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).
The State of New York has started experiments on the anti-biotic effect of Azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Japanese Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCM) plans to conduct a clinical experiment on the use of Teijin’s Alvesco (Cyclisonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat patients with the new coronavirus before the symptoms appear.
Currently, a second phase experiment is being conducted using a form of angiotensin converter enzyme 2 on 200 patients required to join the experiment of severe cases that entered the hospital in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of Colchisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of Covid-19.
The study, called Colcorona, included 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with Covid-19 and suffered from mild symptoms without having to go to the hospital.
Pregnant women, who have normal breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of prevention of pregnancy are not eligible for this.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Currently, low-molecular weight hybarin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which requires the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency to publish instructions on its use.
A multi-centric study in Italy on 300 patients was announced to discuss the use of inoksaparin sodium in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS COV-2 virus, a major scientific interest focused on re-use of certified antiviral drugs designed to deal with previous epidemic cases such as Mars, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Experts recommend using Ribavirin to treat Covid-19 according to the 7th version of Chinese Guidelines
Omefenovir: Experts recommended use of Omefenovir for Covid-19 treatment according to the 7th version of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified the possibility of re-use as treatments for Covid-19 include:
Tosilezumab (Future Anti-Interlocking 6): Accredited from China.
Experiments in Italy and China as well. see Tosilezumab #Kovid-19.
The Covid-19 vaccine is a presumed vaccine against the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19)
Although no vaccines for clinical trials have been completed, there are many attempts to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to be available against the SARS-COV-2 virus in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first stage of safety studies in April.
Covid-19 was announced in December 2019.
A major eruption spread worldwide in 2020, leading to large investments and research activities for the development of the vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomas to develop potential vaccines against SARS-KOV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition Initiative on Preventive Impacts to Combat Epidemias for the Development of Vaccines, which was announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread dissemination and global access.
In April, coalition scientists on Epidemial Precautionary Infections that 10 different technological platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against Covid-19.
The main platform objectives that advanced to the first stage of safety studies include:
DNA (Ribosic DNA reduced oxygen and Ribosic DNA) (Developers of the First Stage and Vaccination Candidate: Moderna, and mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer of the first stage and vaccine candidate: Modern, and genetic virus carrier of type 5)
According to the Coalition Scientists on Epidemial Precautionary Infections in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milkine Institute), and 37 other projects announced, but with little public information available (those are supposed to be in the planning stage or are being designed).
The first and second phase tests are a primary safety and safety test, usually random, and are controlled with negligence, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Third-stage experiments usually include a greater number of participants, including the reference group, and a test of the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-developed vaccines (confirmed from the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (they are still under "pre-clinical" research).
Approximately on January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the possibility of a molecular retina vaccine that would modify viral proteins genetically to stimulate immune reaction.
Approximately 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccination Center (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University announced the start of the work on a vaccine, which aims to start human testing in 2021.

BNT162 is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it will get pre-clinical tests results in April 2020 and the final candidate vaccine may start having tests on humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition of Epidemial Prevention Initiatives (CBI) announced a $4.9 million investment in the Coalition of Research for the Covid-19 vaccine, which includes the Institute of Pasteur, the Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, which pushed the total investment of the Coalition of Epidemial Prevention Initiatives in the development of the Covid-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Coalition partners involved in preventive measures to combat epidemics for the development of the Covid-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started testing on animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College in London on March 20, 2020 announced that they are developing a self-pumped Rebozy Nucleic Acid Vaccine for Covid-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of 275 million Canadian dollars for 96 research projects on anti-Kovid-19 medical measures, including numerous candidate vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago Initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
Almost at the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the development of the Covid-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national vaccine bank of several new vaccines that can be used in case of another coronavirus explosion.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine tests for PittCoVacc, the potential vaccine for Covid-19 in mice, where they that “Sars-Kov-2 subunit vaccines given with microwave triggered strong reactions to specific antibodies [in mice] which were obvious from 2 weeks after vaccination.”
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on the Ribosic DNA oxidized as a potential nasal spray.
Using an acetate, recycled ribosic DNA will design oxygen for reproduction within human bacteria to produce non-salary particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce anti-Sars-Kov-2 bodies.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access IBM’s giant computers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, and are also called unidentified effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease you are fighting.
Another random experiment in Australia seeks to register 4,170 health care workers.
Current vaccines are unlikely to be safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific animal models for Covid-19, such as genetically modified angiotensin 2-enzyme mice, and other laboratory animals, and non-human chefs, suggests the need for biological safety retention measures of Level 3 to deal with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Anti-Sars and Middle East respiratory syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal patterns.
As of 2020, no treatment or vaccination for SARS has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When Mars spread, it was believed that existing research on SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against the Mars-Kov infection.
Starting March 2020, there was one vaccine for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (based on the Robotic Oxide DNA) completed the first stage of clinical trials in humans, three other vaccines are being developed, all of them were viral-directed vaccines, two viral-directed vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-directed vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have triggered a conspiracy theory that claims that the caused virus was known and the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media posts indicate existing patents for genetic sequence and vaccines for other races of corona viruses such as the corona virus that causes the SARS.
The corona virus 2019 (Kovid-19) is caused by the corona 2 virus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS KOV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing difficulty.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat inflammation, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between the exposure to the infection and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop to viral pneumonia and multiorgan failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people were in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people recover. the virus is mainly spread among people during mixing, often by spread spread when coughing, swallowing, or speaking.
When the spray is swallowed during the scratch process, it usually falls on the ground or on the surface instead of being infected through distances.
People can also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, their nose, or their mouths.
The virus can remain alive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more infectious in the first three days of the symptoms, although it may spread before the symptoms appear and in the late stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the sequential polymerase reaction of instant reversal (RR-T-BCR) by using a nasal bulimia scan.
It is recommended to use the masks for those suspected of infection with the virus and those who take care of them.
Recommendations for people to use the mask are different, some authorities recommend not to use it, some consider it differently, and others have to use it.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or anti-virus treatment for Covid-19.
The transmission of the disease has been at the local level in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not show any symptoms or have symptoms similar to flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing discomfort.
Immediate medical care is recommended if emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty awakening, or scratch in the face or lips.
In less common cases, symptoms related to the upper respiratory system may be observed such as swelling, nasal swelling, or throat inflammation.
Symptoms related to the digestive system such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different proportions.
In the beginning, some cases in China suffered only from breasts and swelling.
In some, the disease may evolve to pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death.
This is called childbirth.
In general, the infancy period of Koveed-19 is from 5 to 6 days but may be between 2 and 14 days.
97.5% of those with symptoms will get this within 11.5 days of the infection.The reports indicate that the symptoms may not appear on all those affected.
The role of the disease holders has not yet been fully recognized without symptoms appearing on them in the transmission of the infection; however, initial evidence indicates the possibility of their contribution to the spread of the disease.
The percentage of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDC) that 20% of the total confirmed cases did not show any symptoms while they were in the hospital.
The National Health Committee of China began to include cases with no symptoms in the daily ratio on 1 April; of the 166 cases on that day, there were 130 (78%) of those cases with no symptoms at the test.
Butterfly and games may bear a large proportion of the virus.
Speaking in a loud voice produces more spray than speaking in a normal way.
A study in Singapore revealed that cough without covering the mouth could lead to a spray that spreads up to a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by the air, the National Academy of Sciences pointed out that it can be transmitted by the biopharmacy, and the samples of air collectors in the corridor outside the rooms of individuals have resulted in positive results for the virus-ribozy DNA.
Some medical procedures such as infusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the release of respiratory emissions into the spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through ejaculation, it is believed that this risk is limited.The virus is more infectious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before the symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some mystery about how easy the disease is to spread, one person can spread from two to three other people in general.
Specifically, it was found that the virus remained on a day on solid paper, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AIS 304) and up to four hours on 99 percent of bakery.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and cleansers are also effective provided they are properly used; soap dissolves the viral fatty membrane and stops its work, as well as releases the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chloride (chirurgical purifier), are available with less efficiency.In a Hong Kong study, slice samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral pregnancy, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient showed the highest viral pregnancy.
Corona 2 associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) is a new corona virus associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia within the group of severe respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
The renewed SARS KOV-2 virus shares its properties with coronavirus related in nature.
Outside of the body, home soap destroys the virus, where it destroys its preventive membrane. SARS COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS COV.
Both lungs are the most affected organs with Covid-19 because the virus enters the cells hosted by the enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the second-type cell found in the lungs.
The virus uses a special superficial sugar protein called Spike (Folphic Division) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of those infected who entered the hospital in Wuhan, China, suffered severe heart attacks, and were more common in critical cases.
The rates of symptoms associated with the heart and blood vessels are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease, but severe heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and participate in performing its functions.
The rate of convulsions (31%) and vascular convulsions (25%) in patients in the concentrated care unit with Covid-19 may be linked to a weak prediction of what the condition will lead to.When the body of individuals who died from Covid-19 was diagnosed, a spread and inflammatory convulsion contained lymphic cells inside the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is directed towards the ACE2 spinal cells in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hypertension.
In particular, it was revealed that the thyrotic cells that trigger MG-SSF are linked to bringing the only cells that trigger inflammatory and pulmonary intralucinate in Covid-19 patients.
It was also that there was a lymphoma during the body's diagnosis.
The World Health Organization has published several test protocols for the disease.
The sequential polymerase reaction for instant reverse versions (RRT-BCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasal bulking; however, a nasal bulking or bulking sample can also be used.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires taking two blood samples within two weeks and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a coronavirus breed and spread the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase sequence (BCR) tests to detect the viral infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past or not) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is between 60 and 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Chongnan Hospital at Wuhan University proposed ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemic risks.
The binary and multi-sided scratched glass spots with an environmental, uneven and background spread of the common characteristics at the beginning of the infection.
The subside spread and the form of a stone scratch may appear (the thickness of the scratch with an unlevel scratch fill) and integration with the development of the disease.
There are few data available about the microbial and pathological physiology of Covid-19.
The main pathological conclusions of the diagnosis of the bodies:
Microbial examination: gingivitis, thamoritis, pneumonia and pneumonia
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pneumonia, overweight tissue of lung cells, large non-typical cells, malignant pneumonia with lymphoma and forming multi-core giant cells
Acute pneumonia: spread sinus damage (DD) with spread sinus emissions.
The spread sinus damage causes severe respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and severe blood oxidation deficiency.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of emissions in the sinus cavities and vaginal pneumonia
Blood: dispersed inside the vessels (DIC); white blood cells react
Preventive measures include to reduce the chances of staying at home, avoiding busy places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, exercise good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC is recommended to cover the mouth and nose with a pants when cough or swallow, and it is recommended to use the inner part of the attachment if the pants are not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands well after any cough or sweat.
The CDC recommended the use of clothes in public places, partly aimed at reducing the transmission of infection to those with no symptoms.Social distinction strategies aimed at reducing the interference of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and abolishing large public meetings.
Distance guidelines also include that people should be distant from each other at a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no drug known for its effectiveness in the prevention of Covid-19, and since the vaccine is not expected to be invented until 2021 as soon as possible, the main part of control of Covid-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as the "cover plate".
CDC also recommends people to wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are clearly scratched, before eating, after cleaning the nose, cough or swelling.
It is also recommended to use a hand sterilizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, where not only soap and water are available.For areas where hand cleansers are not easily available, the World Health Organization offers two compounds for domestic production.
Antimicrobial activity occurs in these two compounds of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial bacteria in alcohol; it is “not an effective substance to clean the hands.”
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People get supported care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and assistance to other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends people who are suspected of having the virus to wear a simple face mask.
External membrane oxides (ECMO) are used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but their benefits are still being studied.
It is recommended for personal hygiene and depend on a lifestyle and a healthy diet to improve immunity.
Supporting treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms in the early stages of the infection.The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Committee have published recommendations to care for those who have been transferred to the hospital due to Covid-19.
Concentrate Care and Lung Disease Experts in the United States gather treatment recommendations from a variety of bodies in a free supplier, a critical case care book available online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for Covid-19 was available.
For symptoms, some specialized doctors recommend using paracetamol (acetaminofin) instead of iboprofine as the first treatment.
The necessary precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of the virus's transmission, especially in health care locations when the procedures that may result in spray, such as scratching or manual breathing, are carried out.
For health care professionals who take care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an air-transmitted infection (AIR) isolation room, as well as using standard reserves, mixing reserves and air-transmitted disease reserves.
Recommended tools: Personal preventive equipment, respiratory or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. it is preferable to use respiratory devices (instead of face mask) if available.
The N95 respiratory devices were adopted for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration declared using the masks under the Emergency Use License (IEA).
They are designed to protect against air-powered molecules such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological factor is uncertain if used for other unidentified purposes.
When the masks are not available, the CDC Center recommends the use of face protectors or home-made masks as the last solution.
Most Covid-19 cases are not deteriorated to the extent that it requires industrial breathing or alternatives, but some cases need it.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for hospitals is actively undergoing the study, with some evidence of the possibility of avoiding respiration using the high-flow nasal technique or the two-level positive pressure of the airflow.
It is not known whether either of these options is the same benefit for those with a critical condition of satisfaction or not.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas-industrial breathing as long as it is available because this technology restricts the spread of empty particles compared to high-flowing nasal tissue.Critical cases are more common among elderly people (over 60 years old, especially those over 80 years old).
Many developed countries don’t have enough hospital beds for the population, limiting the health system’s ability to deal with the sudden rise in the number of dangerous COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 percent of cases were entered into concentration care units, 2.3 percent needed industrial respiratory support, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, 30% of those who have been transferred to hospitals due to Covid-19 are eventually entering concentrated care units.
Industrial breathing becomes more complex with the development of severe respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) in people with Covid-19 and the supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
The respiratory system must have high-positive pressure control and high-positive end pressure to maximize the supply of oxygen while reducing the risk of pneumonia associated with the respiratory system and breast relaxation to a minimum.
The high-positive end-of-zferic pressure may not be available in the old respiratory system.
Search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs in the stage of clinical trials.
Remediosphere seems to be the most messaging.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to evolve, many testing drugs have already been approved for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization has recommended volunteers to participate in experiments on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use recovery plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is dangerous or directly threatened.
It did not undergo the necessary clinical studies to prove it was safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease.
Users are required to enter their name and ID.
The app is able to detect 'interferents' using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential hazards are detected, the app not only recommends self-healing stone, but also warns local health officials.Massive data analysis uses mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence to track the injured and those mixed in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security agencies to track the mobile data of those allegedly infected with the corona virus.
The measures were taken to impose a health stone and to protect those likely to interfere with the injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone sites data gathered with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, for the purposes of research and preventing the spread of the virus.
Russia has used the face recognition technology to detect sanitary stone disorders.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galera said mobile companies told him that “40% of people are still moving everywhere.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon on a weekend in which more than 42,000 people participated.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kersti Calliolaid, also presented a global invitation to present innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel anxious due to health stones, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injuries themselves.
The BBC published a statement to Rory O'Connor: "Augmented social isolation, unity, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a tremendous storm that damages people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may take a mild cycle involving mild symptoms or be symptomatic, as it is similar to other common diseases of the upper respiratory system, such as swelling.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more susceptible to severe Covid-19 infection based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of Covid-19 data that can affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
Covid-19 in the worst affected people can quickly develop to severe respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS), which leads to respiratory failure, intramuscular trauma or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with Covid-19 include intan, an abnormal blood clot, heart, kidney, and liver damage.
6% of people with Covid-19 who were hospitalized diagnosed with anemia of blood clot, specifically an increase in the time of prothrombin, while 4% of them were diagnosed with kidney dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with Covid-19 showed an elevated level of liver enzymes (amin carriers).
According to the same report, the average period between the occurrence of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five were in the hospital.
However, the average period for those who were transferred to the center was seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average period from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, and overall cases were from six days to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Committee (NHC) in China, the average male death rate was 2.8%, while the average female death rate was 1.7%.
Pathological and tissue-analysis tests of lung samples after death show a widespread spinal damage with the presence of cellular fibromoxide emissions in both lungs.
Changes in viral cellular disorder were observed in sinus cells.
The image of the lungs shows the syndrome of severe respiratory disorder (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high troponin levels or heart attack was observed in 11.8% of deaths by the National Health Committee in China.
According to data released by the U.S. in March, 89% of those hospitalized were suffering from previous medical conditions, as well as the availability of medical resources and the social and economic situation of the region could affect deaths.
The estimates of deaths resulting from the situation vary as a result of these differences between regions, even due to systematic difficulties.
Reduced limitation of simple cases may lead to an increase in the percentage of deaths than the truth.
However, the fact that causes previous deaths may indicate that the current death rate is lower than the fact.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer from severe symptoms of Covid-19 and 2.4 times more likely to suffer from intense care than non-smokers.
The authority of the Hong Kong Hospital revealed a reduction in lungs capacity by 20% to 30% in some recovered from the disease, and lungs tests indicated that there was a damage.
This may also cause post-centric care syndrome after healing.
Starting in March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infection gained effective and long-term immunity.
The acquisition of immunity is considered possible, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but it was announced that there were cases of recovery from Covid-19 and later injured again.
These cases are believed to get worse if the infection continues more than when it repeats.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely a result of its transition from human to human.
A study on the first 41 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that 1 December 2019 is the first date of symptoms.
World Health Organization (WHO) reports that December 8, 2019 is the first date for symptoms.
Many measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time taken since the start of the disease, and the population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
In the end of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 10th review of the International Emergency Classification of Diseases (ICC) assigned U7.1 to confirmed SARS-COV-2 deaths and U7.2 to confirmed COVID-19 deaths clinically or epidemically without confirmation of the SARS-COV-2 deaths.
According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, the world’s death rate of injuries is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by area.Other measurements include the death rate of cases (CFR), which represents the percentage of people who have been diagnosed and died from a disease, the percentage of infectious deaths (IFR), which represents the percentage of people who have been diagnosed and who have not been diagnosed) and those who have died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a timeline, as well as they track a specific population group from the infection to the fate of the situation.
Although the antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all the affected, their presence may provide information about the number of affected.
At the heart of the disease in Italy, Castilloni de Ada, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, has already killed 80 people (1.7%)
In Ganglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and transmitted to youth, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all Covid-19 deaths were officially classified as a result of it.
In addition, the German health system was not broken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to an estimate of blood donors.
The deaths of 69 (0.004 percent of the population) were confirmed due to Kovid-19.
The effect of the wound and the resulting death rate vary between men and women.
Death rates are higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the average death rate was 2.8 percent in men and 1.7 percent in women.
The exact causes of these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Immunity differences based on gender, non-smoking among women and men with simultaneous diseases such as high blood pressure in younger than women may have contributed to higher death rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of the affected were men and 72% of those who died due to Covid-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government will not track gender-classed data for Covid-19 injuries.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to get infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "Kovid-19".
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, TEDROS ADHANUM GEBRISUS, explained that Co is an abbreviation of the word corona, an abbreviation of the WD virus and 19 indicates the year of the first detection of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
The name is selected to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international reference recommendations aimed at preventing spotting.The Covid-19 virus is called the Corona 2 virus associated with the severe severe respiratory syndrome (Sars Cov-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the terms “Covid-19” and “Covid-19 responsible virus” in public data.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the first epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "Corona Virus" and "Corona Wuhan Virus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of the new coronavirus 2019 and acute respiratory disease associated with the new coronavirus 2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease according to the 2015 guidelines that prevent the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names of Koveed-19 and Kove-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export health care materials such as nose brushes and respiratory parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respiratory valve and the supplier was unable to deliver in time, a local startup turned its engineering and issued the 100 required valves in one night.
After the first spread of the Covid-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misconduct about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease appeared and rapidly spread online.
It seems that humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus's reproduction in pigs, butter, and chicken.
There are no medications or certified vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “Solidarity Experiment” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that have the best and promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but different bodies are actively working on the development of candidate vaccines.
It is used by previous studies of SARS COV because it is similar to SARS COV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccine strategies are undergoing the study.
First, the researchers aim to invent a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection with Covid-19.
The second strategy, partial units vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some partial units of the virus.
In the case of SARS COV-2, this research focuses on the SPEIC S protein that helps the virus to infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA vaccines or RIBOZIC DNA, a new technology for the innovation of the vaccine).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical vaccination experiment was launched on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an unharmful genetic code of the virus that causes the disease.I am referring to the antibody-based vibration as a potential challenge facing the invention of the SARS COV-2 vaccine, but this is contradictory.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials ongoing from April 2020.
Seven tests have already been validated for malaria, including four studies related to hydroxy chlorokin or chlorokin.
The proposed reuse of antiviral drugs in the treatment of the new disease is the majority of Chinese research, through nine phase-third experiments on Remedicifer across several countries and their results are scheduled to be by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of the vaccines and potential Covid-19 properties has been carried out as of April 2020.A number of existing antiviral properties for Covid-19 treatment are being evaluated, including Remedicifer, Chlorokin, Hydroxy Chlorokin, Lupinavir/Ritonavir, Lupinavir/Tonavir integrated with Interferon Beta.
There are preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of Remedicifer, starting March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients who have been treated with Remedicifer for merciful use.
Third-stage clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chlorokin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are invitations to conduct a review of the research counterparts.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research points out that despite the recommended dose of one gram, the weakness of this dose is extremely dangerous and can cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued a license for emergency use of hydroxy chlorokine and chlorokine according to the doctor’s assessment for people with Covid-19.The 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines also includes Interferon, Ribavirin or Omefenovir for use for Covid-19.
Initial data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to suppress SARS KOV-2 in the laboratory.
It is recommended to conduct further study of the effects of nitazoxanide on living organisms after it has been demonstrated to undermine the low concentration of SARS COV-2.Studies have shown that the preliminary preparation of spike protein through the trans-gluten serin protease 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary to enter SARS COV-2 through interaction with the future of ACE2.
