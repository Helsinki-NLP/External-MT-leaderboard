The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and two young children (Mary Theresa and Louis Charles, 11), the king's sister, Elizabeth, were sent to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a group of market women.
They got in a carriage and drove back to Paris in a mob of angry men who were screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their car.
On one occasion, a member of the mob bowed the head of a royal officer who had been killed at Versailles to the Terrible Queen.
The American colonial burden of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.



The time of these events is generally considered to be the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries of the High Middle Ages of European history (1000-1300 BC).

The technical criterion is a term that encompasses a practically broad range of ideas, from the technical drive or technological necessity to the underlying logic bound to scientific laws and the expression of them by technology to the intense sense that human destiny is directed.

Dependent agriculture is a simple, often organic method of using seeds native to an ecosystem in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple harvesting techniques.

Subculture brings together like-minded people who are ignored by social norms and allows them to build an identity.
Subcultures may be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.


One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on children who have been victims of a few unfortunate events, such as being not properly socialized, neglected, misbehaved or intentionally abused by adults as they grow up.
Some violent children have been cornered by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, severe intellectual or physical disability may lead to a child being rejected by these parents.

Some were allegedly bred by animals; others were said to live alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, unruly children (within physical limits) exhibit the same fear or difference as humans do to their protected identity.
Project-based learning should make learning easy and fun, and go beyond the scaffold.
Support is not a form of learning, but rather a support to those who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to question, interrogate, and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle on his or her own.


We see the dedicated care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our local assistance system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
"Dedicated care" means providing all the necessities that they didn't have in their previous home.

Oliver Sacks, in his book The Presidents Speech, explains how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
He suggests that such abilities might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs in interpreting human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variant, and the selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
The variation in the decomposition and recombinant excretions varies back and forth between the two reservoirs with each generation.

And failure to do so has severe consequences: growth stress, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available sources were the raw proteins found in leaves and radish seeds, which are difficult for primates like us to digest.
The food of the animals (ants, ants, eggs) is a high-protein, non-digestible raw food containing all the essential amino acids.
Totalizing, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way as today's chimpanzees in the savannah.

The most efficient way to transport people and goods across the oceans in large quantities is by ship.
Traditionally, the role of the marines is to enable the movement of people and goods from your country and, in the meantime, to prevent the movement of people and goods from your enemy.
One notable recent example of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and vessels across the Atlantic to support Britain.
, the German marines, with the help of U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.

Most paleontologists today believe that there was one group of dinosaurs that survived and are alive today. We'll call them birds.
Because they have wings and they can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.

They have legs with spines and nails, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and this binary number is called a digit - or bit in computer programming.

The existence of interstitial cycles and their production via biological clocks often determine the rhythms of physiology and behavior.
The cyclic rhythm, which is not just a response to external cues, has been documented in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, branches, and animals.
Bioclocks are self-sustaining oscillators and will continue in a freely running cycle, albeit without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important proposals for DNA as genetic material.
Hirsey and Chase used a plant or virus to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two tests, either radioactive phosphorus for DNA marking in bacterial feeder or radioactive sulfur for protein marking in bacterial feeder.
The mutations can give different results depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a stem cell.
The only mutations that are passed on to children are those that are in the genitourinary tract, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the surface is about 70 km thick and the far side is 100 km thick.
On the moon, it is thin under the plains and thick under the high ground.
The surface is thinner, so there are more tidal waves nearby, and the lava is easier to get to the surface.
satisfaction theory is about finding out what people like or what attracts them.

In the general discourse, two behaviors can emerge when managers lead their former colleagues. One extreme in that spectrum tries to be one of the "colleagues".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
The other end of the spectrum is where someone becomes an unidentified person who feels like changing everything the group has been doing and making it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
