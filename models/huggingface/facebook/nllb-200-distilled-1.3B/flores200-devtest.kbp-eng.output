It does not prove that dinosaurs actually had wings, as is commonly claimed, but it does prove other things that nature cannot reveal, such as color and three-dimensional vision.
Scientists say that the creature had long, broad eyes that were covered with a thick layer of skin.
This has led to a new understanding of how birds' wings have changed over time.
