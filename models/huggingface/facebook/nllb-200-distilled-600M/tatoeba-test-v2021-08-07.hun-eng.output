I turned red like a tomato.
I turned down the offer.
I'm sorry I visited Australia.
I'm going to rest.
I remember you both.
I remember that, too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I reminded him of his duty.
I respect Tom.
I'm retiring in four years.
I risked my ass for you.
First, iron these shirts out.
I'm running faster than you.
I run eight miles a day.
I'm running.
I've been rearing the horses, sir.
I said that, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wasn't gonna be good.
I said no.
I said thank you.
I was sitting there looking.
I sat next to him.
I sat down and thought.

I was just in danger.
I sent you flowers.
I served with Tom in the Special Forces.
I've divided the table into six people.
I've got six of them.

I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.

I've been looking at a picture.
I broke into the house.
I broke into the house.
I was smoking.
You okay with that?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't that a stomachache?
I sold it this afternoon.
I'm sad sometimes.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.

I still can't tell you why.
I remember clearly, it was seven or eight years ago.

I came by your house today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I study for about two hours a day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mary.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I must have heard that sound somewhere.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about that.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're through.
I'll take your place.
I take the train to work every day.
I spoke to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
She's better off with your sister.
It's accompanied by the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
That's two euros.
You might have a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
He's obviously freaked out.
It didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow hasn't stopped.
The snow hasn't stopped.
He'll let you in cold.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they spilled it on me.
I soon realized I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened early last week.
This is what happened on our wedding day, honey.
There must be a reason for this.
It happened all of a sudden.
That was when he was out.
It's happened to me a few times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It's not good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should be on a diet.
I think everyone is hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think I dropped some movie tickets.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I would be able to kill.
I don't think I can kill him.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better this way.
I think it's right.
There's very little chance, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do it yourself.
I think he's going to.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it is.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mary.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I like spiders.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm going to drink.
I think, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's going to be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was there.
I think Tom is a bit of a nuisance.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom may be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Thomas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Thomas is winning.
I think we're gonna get through this.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're going in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all crazy now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know her.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Thomas' girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you've got it all wrong.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a very good job.
I think you smell good.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking of Tom.
I thought if we went out to dinner, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was exploding.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't turn out to be.
I thought Tom still lived in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were her.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
It hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under the influence.
It had a huge impact on me.
This is dangerous!
This is a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what you're talking about.
It's hard to please everybody.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have my doubts about whether it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone now.
It's half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every way possible.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's the afternoon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector cannot be turned off.
That's not the best solution.
That's not the right answer.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying to me.
It's not right to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, the weather is really bad today.
It's ridiculously expensive.
It's about 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
This is useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after you change your baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's going to be dangerous.
It's going to be dark before we get home.
It'll be ready when it's needed.
It'll be ready when it's needed.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
It'll be all right soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
It looks bigger as a result.
It looks good.
Looks like you don't need me here.
You'd need a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
It could be a trap.
It could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
I need to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
It was stolen, I'm sure.
It needs to be fixed.
He never existed.
It never should have happened.
I lied to her about not wanting to.
I told him I'd do my best.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tom.
I'd like to ask you a question.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I've got it.
I went to 58th Street.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the veterinary hospital yesterday.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It's probably cheaper elsewhere.
It rained yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train for two hours a day.
I've been all over Russia.
I've been to the United States cross country.
It actually works.
This is really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd put my life in his hands.
I'm trying to keep up with the news.
I'm trying to get my mind together.
That's a nice flag.
It's a big-ass cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, on paper at least.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a guard dog.
It's half an hour until lunch.
It's a hot day.
This is a kitchen.
It's completely dark outside.
This is all mine.
It's all right now.
It's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already in progress.
It's already ten o'clock.
One of my dreams was always to live by a stream.
It's always the same note.
It's an environmental disaster.
This is a lousy business, Watson, a lousy, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame.
I'm sorry I was late.
It's a shame that Tom is leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
This is a terrible story.
It's cold.
It's as much art as science.
It's the past.
He's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport where a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
This is awful.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's a tiring day.
It's been a rough day.
This has happened before.
It wasn't any week.
It's been two years since she left.
This is better.
It's better to garden at night.
It's a fire.
It's on fire.
It's cheaper to take a bus.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed every Sunday.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in the house.
It's cold, I'm a little skinny.
It's cold outside.
It's cold, why don't you put on a sweater?
It's been known that a bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
This is perfectly normal.
It's all right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's really good.
It's ready!
It's easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from afar.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mary.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It's like it was yesterday we went to school together.
It seems nothing has changed.
It looks really weird.
It seems.
It seems he's lying.
Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
Like you don't want me to get this together.
You seem honest to me.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's fair to get the same pay for the same job.
It's not perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is yours.
You know, this is funny.
It's starting to get cold.
It's getting serious.
We're going to be tough.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be hot.
It's good for learning.
It's great you could come.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and sunny all along.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
She's just so beautiful.
He's got a disproportionately large head.
It's high.
Kids have their place in bed.
Stop playing with the money.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important to me.
It is important that parents stand by when it comes to raising their children.
It's important to help those in trouble.
It's impossible for me.
We're gonna have to drown him in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
You never know what tomorrow will bring.
It's incredible, you know?
It's inevitable.
That is inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
It's just a little further.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's a little hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
There's a wash today.
It's like an undersea field, and the turtles and the sharks and the turtles are flying creatures.
This is locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
This is me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
It's my turn now.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
You have nothing to do with it.
It's not a bad idea.
This is not a bank.
Not as guarding as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This is not gonna happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth mourning.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't say that to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest unless you repent.
There's no point in being bitter about the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think he's a farmer.
It's okay to be gay.
 Three months have passed, and Tom says he speaks French fluently.  Well, he's at his stupidest peak.  What peak?  Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, right?
It's all over.
It's personal.
It's like a coughing up of a dog.
He spread his wings.
It's pretty amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is to disparage the working class, to free imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it instigates, and to undermine the idea that the causes of endless wars are man's innate aggressive tendencies.
It's really urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, right?
That's a really big number.
I got it.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit! Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing in here.
It's snowing in Boston right now.
It's so good to be home.
He's still moving.
This is suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
That's something we still have to answer.
It's time to get our tent.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
It's time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time we did something about it.
Tom has a birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mary's.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
It's too hot for this right now.
It's a bit late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn.
It's a crap thing to have a cold.
It's ugly, it's creamy yellow and it's not in harmony with anything, but at least they don't get gasped in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
It's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's really fun.
It's expensive to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
It takes about 10,000 hours to learn a language thoroughly.
You have to be brave to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me about three years to build my house.
It came as a surprise to everyone.
It took me an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but I finally found it.
I've turned into a little alley.
I was just...
I'm going to turn left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really good food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully weird.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely a lot of fun.
We had a good time last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the weather was humid.
It was just a little outing.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
