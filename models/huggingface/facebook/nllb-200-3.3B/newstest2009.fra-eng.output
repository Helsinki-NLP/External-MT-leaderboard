After the stock exchange closed, the Prague Stock Exchange went down.
After the crash on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered its losses.
The transactions with ČEZ shares amounted to almost half of the usual daily transactions.
On Tuesday, as the market began to open, the Prague stock market continued its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in Wall Street stocks.
The market reaction to the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan for the stabilisation of the US financial sector, is thus also perceptible in our country.
Shares fall in Asia
Asian stock markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the indices managed to erase some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost four percent during trading, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index tracking the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange was losing more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
Its index showed the Taiwan stock market down 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation over the US bailout will affect financial markets around the world", observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said US lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to shore up the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected.
The bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, which would have required spending up to $700 billion.
The lawmakers thus denied President George Bush's call for support for the bill.
Bush said the project would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath Monday, and major stock indexes suffered their biggest decline in 20 years.
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, the last time it fell so far in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress caved in: the US government can inject $ 700 billion into the banks
Leaders in the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broader form of financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in the talks to adopt a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial system.
Success is not guaranteed.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the bill and put it to a vote, Congressmen must finish a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be considered in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Sources say the plan is expected to be put to a vote in the Senate on Wednesday at the earliest.
Economists say that the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market support can be effective, a 'disillusionment' will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form the package of measures for market stabilisation should take", Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislature met with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson to give the government's budget a final shape.
The latter should buy back from financial companies the unsellable real estate assets which cause considerable losses to financial companies and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The plan to re-establish the markets still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there", says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are working to get Congress to reach a final agreement by Sunday.
They are hoping to calm investors before trading begins on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect trading on Monday.
It is impossible at the moment to say with certainty when the two houses of the US Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations will be blocked at the last moment by some problem or another.
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount of aid for the scheme must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be made available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its purpose, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
While the president can veto the decision, Congress has the option to veto the decision.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funds to buy back bad real estate, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed with the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Mr Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on accountability for the financial program, protection of contributors from losses, settlement of impairments, the timing of the plan.
The new law also provides for a limit on the use of the golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides for assistance for property owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new installments for mortgages it is going to buy, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because the mechanism and price of the repurchase of the problem assets are unknown.
This will be a key point in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is, according to Marek, not so important.
"It is much more important that the members of Congress agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will pass it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is the most important thing at the moment", Marek stressed.
A battle that went to the extreme: MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We'll advise you how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
There are, however, good reasons for acquiring a standalone reader.
The choice of the material depends entirely on the future owner's requirements and the way it is used.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end gramophone for the house to play the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
If you have a stack of vinyl records in your home, with art rock, jazz, or blues music on them, you are probably at least dreaming of such a phonograph.
The same applies to music on the move, compressed music, to put it simply, MP3 music.
Here, too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty withholding headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
There's a lot to choose from.
Battery life is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobile phones.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to basic functions, such as telephone calls and text messages, it can play music and movies, record them, has a camera of varying quality and can even be used for navigation.
And if you factor in smartphones and communicators, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take pictures, we are witnessing a miracle.
The universal nature of the mobile, however, is not without its drawbacks.
The greater the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two recharging times.
And playing music is one of the most important energy-consuming activities.
Few mobile phones are capable of playing music for ten to twelve hours, and in most cases, this figure is much lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the more rudimentary ones) are clearly more efficient.
In the case of cheap cell phones, expect them to play music for only a few hours.
If you also call from time to time, get a second charger for work - even for more expensive devices.
This will not be a problem for MP3 players, which can be charged for at least 9 hours of continuous operation, including the least powerful ones.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto the memory card, but few card readers are able to do this without reduction, given the tiny size of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for the readers, you don't need any software, except for (iPod).
All you have to do is fill the USB connector with the music device from the computer.
Most mobile devices and players will create their own media library sorted by artist name, album title, style, or user judgment.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, similar to Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, you should be interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of the sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is essentially background noise for you and you're only going to listen to it for a limited time during the day, for example, when you take the tram, you can use any mobile device that plays MP3s.
Virtually every mobile phone today is capable of this.
You don't even have to worry too much about what music formats your mobile or player can read.
Everyone can play MP3s, and the vast majority of the music that you're going to get is going to be in that format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding mobile phone operator's (or other provider's) web pages and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is very limited and in most cases limited to fast-moving radiotubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, Internet, or even wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their motive around with them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just take your phone out of your pocket, while you left your MP3 player at home.
It is also important whether you always carry headphones or a handsfree device with a connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which are available in almost all mobile phones, but at least MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music devices is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three grand.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, you can have a Walkman that is already very suitable.
But in most cases, you'll be limited by the lack of a standard headphone output.
The best phones and the best equipped ones, with a regular headphone jack, cost no more than fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of easy operation.
Anyone can order the most basic readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest ones (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the control with that of a cassette recorder, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet accidentally connected, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (such as the M2, microSD, and so on).
Even if you take into account the additional cost of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even manage to get by with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, get a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 SEK.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose instead specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series of mobile phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the furthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price range, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
The first virtual operator will enter the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe you can .
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their counterparts in Western Europe.
However, we are still lacking something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower their prices.
He may not be gone for long.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) has reported that the price of SMS is higher in the Czech Republic than in the rest of the EU, and it has confirmed this.
The latest steps by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges are likely to create a paradox - SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we have three mobile networks and a penetration rate well in excess of 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, is making a deal with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network apparently has not much luck (in fact, now it would be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market which led to a considerable fall in prices, which was subsequently also borne by conventional operators.
Yet even before the emergence of such troublemakers as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those we hear today were being heard in Britain.
It has become apparent that there is still room for such operators and that they can be very successful.
We don't have to look far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
The Mobilking is also backed by the Penta financial group, which owns, among others, the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators are promoted as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which are often counterbalanced by a limited range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least twice the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, targeting an unusual target group can also be a good advertising strategy.
This operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work in our country as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický is doubtful: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the mobile operators
It seems almost certain, however, that if there is to be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Czechia the negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area", said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were in any case not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not been hiding its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator for quite some time.
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to make progress in the negotiations", says the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be bright.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps welcome the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific in comparison with other markets.
At the moment, no one with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us", Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonika O2 said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered for the moment viable and bilaterally advantageous projects that could serve as a basis".
She added: "It is virtually unlikely that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should have a concrete agreement now".
Vodafone is instead focusing on fulfilling the requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet".
The responsible authorities: in step with the operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
So what's the point in facilitating the arrival of such a competitor?
The operators are able to work together like thieves in a fair, as is also shown by the chicanes that accompanied the creation of the U:fon.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, when the U:fon was created, was the one exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon is ready to be used as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: 'Competition in the mobile market has also been recently increased by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would place high demands on it, and especially on its services".
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The latter is the exclusive property of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
The latter took the typical position on this problem.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, because the offer of potential interested parties was not sufficiently interesting for traditional operators", said Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS external relations department in response to our question.
A statement made in this way would not be surprising on the part of representatives of operators.
But such a statement from an office whose duty is to represent the interests of consumers and also to ensure that no one takes advantage of his position on the market is beyond confusing.
This is all the more true when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside the EU, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decline in the prices of mobile telephone services".
However, pressing for fair market functioning and lower prices does not seem to be in the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which arises from their reactions.
The question naturally arises whether this is really a coincidence.
Similarly, the fact that the price of petrol is exactly the same at all petrol stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
'The Office has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore no corresponding increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even in the telecommunications regulator", Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many points of disagreement.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators holds a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts suggest that the creation of a virtual operator requires the consent of the network operator on a case-by-case basis.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
It is therefore necessarily playing a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
Even without accepting this argument, it should at least be of concern to ÚOHS that three mobile operators are apparently acting in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in their negotiations with all operators.
The blame shifting to the ČTÚ is a fairly common communications ploy, by which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already seen this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not succeed in extending the ČTÚ's powers in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must be well aware of this, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo-operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, this refers to firms that deal with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are usually only available to selected persons.
The magic trick is that the company presents itself to the operator as a conventional business customer, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you are saying happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would look into and that could lead to a breakdown of the collaboration with the company in question", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that the heads of mobile operators have not been informed of such activity.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
The activities of these firms bring them substantial profits and, at the same time, unlike the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
Furthermore, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have full access to it, as ordinary customers of mobile operators do".
And this is precisely what should seem strange about ČTÚ.
In addition, there is another question at ÚOHS.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the operators' explanations, they say they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we're not the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a considerable reduction in the price of services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, the traditional operators made some or all efforts to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries intervened, not in the interests of the mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Both by formal measures and informal pressure, they eventually succeeded in creating a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory agencies treat this issue like a hot potato that you throw away by passing it on to a nearby target.
We cannot, from our experience, get rid of the impression that confusing their skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw the handle after the hammer.
If the behind-the-scenes news is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our country, the Czech mobile market may be back on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, ÚOHS can hardly remain unmoved in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On the occasion of Czech National Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on Sunday solemnly released the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with male or female solo singing, a choral interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The anthem was arranged by Jeremáš Otakar and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had already entrusted to the Czech public radio, he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to ensure that both singers and the choir had a good diction, so that the words were understood and they sang simultaneously", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first heard in 1834 on the stages of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of the Savers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" hymn sounds like
The public transport (MHD) in Prague will introduce the chip in their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will go down in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, with an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it is available to approximately one hundred thousand Opencard holders.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency) located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
As of yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons online on the Dopravní podnik website: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the morning service.
Those who start using the online store can forget about the ticket counters in the subway stations, where they have to wait impatiently in long queues for paper tickets.
They will buy their voucher online and it will be saved on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these contact points, there is a ticket office with trained staff, who will help the customers with the online purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card", says the project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of the ticket composting machines, and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
A machine will check the coupon instead of the driver
The automata that will be operational from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
The main routes are the suburban trains and buses 300 to 499, which are used mainly by the inhabitants of the central Bohemian municipalities to reach the capital.
"In the trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (Prague integrated transport), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons", explained ticket controller Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which designs the timetables of Prague public transport.
The suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's cash register.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the indicated place on the side of the ticket office.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the expiry date of their voucher, can rejoin the vending machines, originally used to save the coupons on the card.
This is where the information on the validity of the document will be displayed on the screen of the device.
The Sudetenlanders were calling for a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the Sudetenland demanded in 1945 that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This is stated in a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (South Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945 groups of Sudeten Germans were allegedly addressing the President of the USA with such a desire.
This is partly due to a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The letter from the Germans of Český Krumlov asks the US President not to allow the "šumavská župa" (forest region in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops are coming to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of the Šumava", reads.
Since the alleged promise of a Czech-Czechoslovak alliance - and the Czech national character - is only brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urge the American president to take the protectorate of Šumava into his own hands once and for all.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state that is foreign to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has done nothing to contribute to the Allied victory without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants", the letter reads.
The alleged reason the authors cannot sign the letter is fear of the vengeful desire of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US, or live under the patronage of the US.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of postwar history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it does illustrate the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans must have at least foreseen the question of their expulsion from the republic, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would secure some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others thought they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, enlisted in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein region's prison camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They thought that once they returned home, Czech would be useful", Chalupa says.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, as a result of the Beneš Decrees, they would be expelled from the republic.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
A campaign of emotions will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transportation intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This 150 million campaign will be shown on television, radio, film, on the Internet, and in leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving too fast and drinking.
But also remind them to put on their seat belts before they start.
It is intended above all to affect the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the ads?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
The campaign's "bloody" slogan is also a testimony to this:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay".
It's a symbol that one can pay for one moment of inattention with one's life.
The ads will haunt viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has drawn inspiration from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures of the victims of accidents are commonly seen.
He believes that this will lead to a reduction in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they turn on a red light.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risks", says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
The psychologist believes that this is why we need information campaigns in the press, and particularly negative publicity.
He said that the warning signs for drivers are already less effective.
"When a static sign is installed that warns of danger, it will probably blend into the environment quickly and drivers will not notice it", says Kořán.
Olmert would give back in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, spoke in favor of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published by the Yedioth Ahronoth daily on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without this, there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want to have his feet crushed by tractors and bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert remarked in reference to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work", he said later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
The European Council also stressed the importance of the European Union's role in the peace process.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan", he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their continued support for the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network), as well as the jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions arising after the accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is forbidden
In the wake of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move around inside the bus during the journey.
"If the law is to be strictly and formally observed, the activity of a flight attendant is contrary to the law on road traffic", said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old flight attendant was killed, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat in the vehicle, although she had two other seats available to her.
The bus may crash or even brake abruptly, even when the steward is serving coffee or distributing newspapers.
The important thing is whether the coach is equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing-up equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance buses run by Student Agency do not have standing seats, which was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue we have dealt with with the Ministry and, at first, it forbids any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat", he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescriptions deal with this role.
Nor does any legal requirement prevent the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law only defines the term 'recipient of a vehicle' and does not define his rights and duties", adds spokesman Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has in its homologation the permission to offer standing places.
It's all in there", he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standing seats with the highest allowed maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like in the airplane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, a BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) transport safety expert, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In normal traffic there is no danger, and the situation can be compared to that of the airline.
There, too, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the flight attendant may hit her head".
"If the bus had brake abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously apply.
The same way you would in a city bus or a streetcar.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal prescriptions", he said, adding that the problem was not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus operator to offer steward services.
He's hired 200 of them.
Even after that accident, the manager doesn't consider their job to be a risky job.
"But as soon as I feel it is a risky job, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on boarding.
It would also reduce costs", he said.
The reason given by the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine for the absence of stewards in his vehicles is concern for safety, which provides, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A great tragedy has come
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop lane without using a flashing light and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he brushed him on his right side.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked".
The company is planning to file a complaint against the truck driver.
As for compensation for the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's decision, but as for financial compensation, it also relies on the perpetrator.
A change in the law?
Out of sight
An amendment to the law, which has been under development for over a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide more details about the travel of stewards on board the coach.
"Now, it has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not very interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers", concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the safety control of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of Düsseldorfs are often placed in Frankfurt.
The letter from the WestLB board of directors to the employees of the company was full of big words.
The letter published on Monday said that the merger of the Düsseldorf financial institution with Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group".
WestLB would provide a 'competence block' with a durable productivity in such a case.
In sum, such a relationship could be the decisive trigger for further concentrations in the Länder's banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a board of directors wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is still under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time - also from Frankfurt - of some form of relationship between Deka Bank, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and WestLB.
It is true that the head of Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, stated at the time of the presentation of the figures for the half-year at the end of August that he saw no point in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse bank with a Land bank, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka, each of which is supported half by the Länder banks and savings bank groups, has instructed the management committee to conduct talks with WestLB with a view to joint business activities.
This could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
The talks are only just beginning, however, the financial centre says.
It is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, has been involved in the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was for a while believed that Deta-Bank might merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate Land Bank and Halbab.
But nothing has come out of this triune bouquet.
The plans had just been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse had spoken out against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses also did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was instead attached to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there were always new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hellaba, had spoken out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Landtag of Bavaria has taken place, a union of BayernLB with the Landbank of Baden-Württemberg could be realized first and foremost.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure to force new mergers were to increase, potential partners would gradually escape him.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it had so far withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfer bank group, which holds 85% of Helaba's capital, however, closed down the merger with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would be the best option.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, reflect only one aspect.
Another aspect is how the different business models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future capacity of the Länder banks had not yet been resolved by the German savings and credit union group.
In the long run, a cutting of the WestLB could take place, a cutting which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what the letter from the existing management committee is about: in any case, it would be a 'global solution' for the establishment.
How all this will be put together with the merger of some entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena is with him as his girlfriend, so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter keg of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows the 200 or so visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then she kisses him.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta Nueva, four buses will leave tonight at 23.45, destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arriving at 6.30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, and one bus is reserved for Brazilians.
In one corner of the car park, the South Americans are singing in gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And as noisy as they are, explains Marco Guarda, they are not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with false fur and wide silver-rimmed glasses.
They've been going to the beer festival for five years, three times this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10:30.
"Staying overnight would be an unnecessary expense", Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome jar with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a manager of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are driving in the night on the Autostrada towards 'Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, the bus is quiet, and the passengers are asleep.
It's better this way, they'll still need their strength.
There will be stops in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian number plates will once again stop shortly before Munich on Highway 8.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Place Thérèse at half past six in the early morning, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, to wear the little yellow cap.
The text on the left is written Festa della Birra', in Gothic, and next to it is the web address of Marco's travel agency conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Secondly: ∀When the doors of the beer hall open, we run', shouts Marco in the early morning.
Run and reserve seats at the back of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we'll block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, they have to be distributed in the room!'
The chope, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And remember the motto!
Show the security officers that we're behaving ourselves!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Thirdly: 'Tonight, be back here at half past ten!' Understood?
And there it is, off to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find their way, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian people's party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'Italian' weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set off across the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 per cent of the visitors were purposely from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place ahead of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Sleepless nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that he was able to slip that the German banking sector would not be spared by the movements of the crisis.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the DAX, obtains a loan of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to the amount of 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the portion of the loan it would be entitled to.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, the subsidiary Depfa is bearing the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself on a very short-term basis for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2,37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 percent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were zero points below the same period in the previous year, while profits from the allocation of debt securities and from the cancellation of provisions in credit operations were down by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
It was only thanks to the substantial profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the interest reimbursement according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the Konzern companies that the profit deficit of around 16 per cent proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had at first speculated poorly on industrial real estate loans, which were then subsidiaries of Aareal Bank.
Because conventional public financing was not sufficiently profitable, Depfa then became more intensely involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
The value of the subsidiary is subject to depreciation by Hypo Real Estate, which should have a material effect on the calculation of the group's profits and losses, which is still quite vague.
The point is, the dividends have been cut.
By 2007, they had already been cut to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has, since the purchase of Depfa, been a highly important investor in the State and in infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions that rely on refinancing on the interbank market, as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has again increased considerably, as banks have accumulated liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing facility annually for a portion - approximately EUR 50 billion - of all Depfa loans.
According to a Hypo Real Estate press release, the group's financing needs are covered by medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets which are largely out of order at the moment.
Other sources say the refinancing will be secured by the funds until the end of 2009.
However, HRE's Chairman of the Board Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to the financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope.
However, given the dynamics and the unpredictability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that the full range of financing should be used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still on the verge of insolvency late Sunday evening, this at least temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price plunged 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While the main debt has barely moved, the price of the secondary loans has been falling.
The investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and those with a lifespan of more than 2009 are the most affected.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate Bank, which previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, now have to be regarded as depending on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of Depfa Bank.
As long as the issuers, governments and less affected commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the leakage will be absorbed over time.
Or what no one dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But with renewed talk of partial nationalisation, the probability that security was approaching has now become a mere hope.
This should save sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular over the decision whether to part with their liabilities.
Short-term investors can still use what they have written off to carry forward losses for the next few years on the next capital gains tax automatically levied.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to present herself for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was afraid to go to school.
I live in the suburbs of Tokyo, and I'm on the train 40 minutes from Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The start of the lessons does not seem to be as strictly fixed as in our Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine to twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have the school uniform, I put on an old school skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue high heels, and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I went to the podium, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did low-key, laughing and signing, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew him from my manga.
It's part of the vocabulary essential for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cute".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next to me gave me a big, wry smile, thinking it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to the best of them, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all came out with their Bento.
My foster mom also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had some rice with herbs, some sausages, a salad of cucumbers and seaweeds, some fruit, and some kind of meat surrounded by tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the plums and the salt and pepper, brrrr!
Bentos are not just a lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl will give a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and then it is prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I wonder if I might observe it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year in school in Tokyo.
I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
After all, reading manga has been my favorite for years.
And to better understand the manga and the culture that is found there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
It was very clear to me that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a soft spot for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never feel lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen".
Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have sensations too.
But how can we be sure that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of articles that answer the question "What do you think is true without having any proof?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it until now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and we approach the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into terrain that is difficult to do because the hardware does not match.
When faced with danger, a rat does what many other animals do: it either feigns death, runs away or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists infer a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in it.
Two aspects of the brain's structure make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in executive and executive functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other creatures.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and to make decisions, it's reasonable to assume that human beings are even different from other primates.
Another significant feature could be the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In that case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness were not to be dependent on language, it would surely be influenced by it, so that animal consciousness, however it is produced, would probably be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what the conscience of other animals may be like.
If this internal and subjective cannot be measured or, because of this particular hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then we have big problems observing it.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
You could look at the processes of consciousness in animals without looking at the content, and that's exactly what happened in studies of short-term memory in primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the focus is more on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in making the visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the body's reactions) takes over the vivid memory.
As we observe, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our fickle nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute to others than to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the cortical cortex and brainstem regions of body sensation, just as Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network hasn't changed much in the course of human evolution, it could very well be involved in cross-sensitivity of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot dispute this, but I believe it to be unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and in rats is probably also felt as fear in both cases: how could we verify whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if it feels fear?
I don't think that similar behavior is enough to prove that we're both from the same place.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensation?
And even if we could prove this in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being made on the nervous level in that the same measurements are being made in rats and in man.
Since I don't study language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think that's short-term, but I'd rather move forward than constantly be bumping into walls.
I am indeed an emotionally pragmatic.
Platini, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships", Wasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries".
In the timetable of building or destroying stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are running behind the time.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed", said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us".
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The commission was convened at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act within the rules", said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured the UEFA President in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not be affected".
Several members of the Premier League were, already in the previous season, convicted for manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid is outraged by the counterattack.
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulterous Dennis Quaid.
He foams and counterattacks.
A late-night war of roses for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a disgraceful battle - in full view of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American magazine InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She would have only become aware of the extent of the deception after the divorce.
The motif of this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her calling him an unfaithful husband was clear: "It would be monstrous", he told the New York Daily News, at the age of 54, that "Meg would rewrite the story of our relationship and manipulate it".
It would be "unfortunate" if "the pain and upsets of divorce for each child were once again reenacted in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack".
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon be the father of twins.
He replied with a claw: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel blessed to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airfare and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, airfares and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, theft could be reduced by as much as 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights have become cheap again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, hotel nights have already been cut in many places.
From January to March, prices were rising in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent more compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly marked in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this, American Express says, lie in the low dollar, which has led to a "decreased desire to travel by American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices held steady with a 26.3 percent rise, the highest in Europe.
The trend in airfares was also upward in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which are very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, but the price fluctuations in business and first class were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
The study even found that domestic flights in Germany were even halved.
The company explains that the reason for this fall in prices is, on the one hand, a weakening of economic growth.
Demand would lose ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The tense situation is reflected in the fact that airlines are cutting non-profitable routes, and the large number of airlines that reportedly filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach by one point .
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes the leader of the ranking.
In the Borussia, Luhukay still has not managed to find a functional eleven.
A crash landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player was late in the game and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precise, his lips were persuasive.
He just knew he was right.
"We need that second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the hall of the Hamburg Arena locker room.
There wasn't much going on in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over and most of the players were settled in their seats.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and what a jump with that second goal!
The practical application has failed.
"Everything was not very pretty today", Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard reportedly "also wished he could be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime) was due to a successful headstroke by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a bad victory", said Marin Jol.
The SV Hamburg will be celebrating its 121st birthday this Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the provisional ranking boards on the giant screen indicating their club as first in class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a step back", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-comers - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the debauched Jansen of FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles", Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
Wall Street is a place of fear.
Early news of the bailout's failure temporarily sent the Dow Jones down 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in the history of the game.
Later, the Dow Jones did a little catch up.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was at 10,579 points, down a whopping five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points, down more than seven points.
The biggest losers in the Dow Jones were American Express, which was down almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which was down about 12 percent.
No more titles could be profitable.
Goldman Sachs' stock fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds must be mobilised to purchase so-called bad mortgage papers.
The amount, however, should not be paid in one lump sum but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company which can be exchanged in line with the price evolution in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices in the US and Europe
Billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not assuage the fears of investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the government's bailout of the financial market.
The dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate investor's shares have lost three quarters of their value at a time despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank has accused a decline of more than 20 percent.
The DAX slipped sharply below the important psychological bar of 6000 points and was at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
Worldwide, the stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street was opening with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's hefty $700 billion bailout plan might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of trading 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on the bailout, with the Senate vote set to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also followed a similar trend: the FTSE 100 index in London fell by 3.2%, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after starting up 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index fell by 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company also said that the shares would not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter is influencing spacecraft flight
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what are called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
With fuel lines soon frozen, cryogenic death is the threat.
For years a mysterious phenomenon has been causing consternation among researchers - the gravitational slide anomaly.
Gravitational propulsion is a maneuver by space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has puzzled researchers for years: flying objects don't always behave 100 percent the way we expect them to according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear in the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They named it the gravitational propulsion anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton firmly believes that Einstein was right and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational pull by using what astronomers have identified in the universe as dark matter.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, matter that is also found near the Earth", he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about dark matter for about ten years.
Apparently, it emits a force of gravity that has an effect on other celestial bodies.
But it is completely invisible - it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
Scientists have calculated that dark matter would still make up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt are expected to be released as the Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the gunfight leading up to the release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The negotiations for the ransom would have already begun.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is the most important case.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported jointly by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic Al-Arabija TV channel and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after Italian television channel Sky TG 24 reported: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are doing well and are safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were freed remain unclear: the kidnappers were close to ending the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security official, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without a word.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", said the agent.
All that was left was to collect the hostages", when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers could find a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse by a father-in-law" that led to suicide"
A court has heard that years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman's suicide.
Trerise, 57, Michael, from Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro County Court of Common Pleas has held that he was in regular contact with his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from the age of five to seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court has been informed that Ms Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged her up before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law has gone to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Mrs Randle, a dedicated volunteer with the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, that she had since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead", and "lost all hope of life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by choking on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father-in-law, who had written a confession that ended with the words, "I tied her up and bandaged her regularly".
"I did not sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're so weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more amazing is that if she had not done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court".
He added: "I would particularly like to emphasize, as described by her father and mother, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stéphanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today".
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office minister who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC reports.
The Ministry of Defence man was on a journey when he left two highly classified documents on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents passed through the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
That is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this matter would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee who cannot be named is charged with violating Section 8.1 of the act, which is the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the guardianship of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Associated Secret Service Committee.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building societies against the B&B bill.
British building companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that collect the money from the savers, including 59 construction companies.
The Managing Director of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it was "irritating" to know that companies and their members would have to pay for the damage...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will rise at the same time will be charged, every year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17.
It is claimed that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
That means the companies will have to find £81 million to pay off the interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the building companies' commercial committee, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It is irritating to see that institutions which behaved prudently during the recovery of the housing market now have to pay for institutions which are much less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, when the first records were made.
"We need to look at all aspects of this over the next few weeks, to evaluate options to avoid the construction companies and their members paying this hefty bill", Mr Cole said.
The interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, you'll have to pay the interest for the whole year, which could double.
Since building societies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill either through higher charges, or through lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk rises to five pence a litre
The people of Jersey must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by five pence a litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase, following a two-penny increase in February, and follows research by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide whether they will in turn raise the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last been changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request for former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is at risk of arrest on her return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's interim military government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents have pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's application saying that she does not need bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return home to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17th, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia both deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed a recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The UN last week carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says she has not been able to reach children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB is losing the ITV legal battle .
BSkyB lost its case following a ruling by the Competition Commission, which would have forced it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares had cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, thereby prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the case.
Virgin's boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, excessive, especially since BSkyB had just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. attorneys' case.
The US attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the question of the firing of nine US attorneys in 2006.
The case was prompted by the report of the Justice Department's inspector general, who criticized the actions of certain department officials.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the lawyers' argument that their dismissal was due to political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate to find out if the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said the prosecutors were fired because of poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired prosecutors were no more criticized than their colleagues, which led some observers to attribute political connotations to the firings.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Republicans in Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate the fraudulent voting allegations against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but not for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of ministerial officials from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "primarily responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "abdicted from his leadership role", remarkably managing not to be involved in this case.
Other Cabinet officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive the recognition.
The song, nine minutes and fifty seconds long, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The awards night is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection limited to four categories.
Q magazine editor Paul Rees said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly part of that.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, peaking at number fifteen.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell spent nine years in the UK charts, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, as he was known - has suffered from poor health in recent years, even undergoing surgery to repair his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then they found a cyst in his vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be on Sale.
New York City has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other parallel roads, some famous, others merely functional.
And even some veteran taxi drivers as well as long-time local residents can't give directions to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alleyway than an active artery.
There are no street signs.
It's virtually impossible to find on a standard atlas.
This street has its admirers, though.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the developer of the recent luxury apartment buildings on First Street.
He wants to redecorate Extra Place, and create a smoother path to the stores and shops that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by the shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the city's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighborhood owners' committees, representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few city-owned spaces left, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place", she said.
"They might offer to rehabilitate and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repaint the street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder will concede the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Avalon Bay spokesperson Michele de Milly said that while the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to re-look this abandoned alley, and make it public", she said, noting that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Housing Conservancy, confirmed that the city was interested in selling the street, further emphasizing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colourful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been called that since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has remained abandoned since.
The rear entrance of CBGB, a punk rock landmark closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly most famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful", said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about the East Village's evolution into luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place a true rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be damned in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and shutters, full of newspapers from the past week that fly along the gutters".
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs briskly down the alley near a doorway that once led to the CBGB, now the headquarters of a high-end clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, lying next to newspapers that had just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested that it be highlighted.
Mr Field, for his part, said he thought some underestimated the appeal of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were spent in dark, wet, and disgusting places".
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the California Studies and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think. Why Middle Class People Should Have the Right to Choose Their School".
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education proposals are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign emphasizes that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students". This is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program specifically advocates, among many other topics, "transitional bilingual education" for English language learners.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that advocates for the teaching of languages other than English in the classroom is beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom are new arrivals, are studying English.
Of the students in the first year, 100% passed the 2008 state examination in mathematics, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language-arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to a different ingredient than the one Mr. Obama had put forward.
Sixth Street is about analysis, practice, constant evaluation of ability and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, and if you went without his class, you would have no chance of identifying him".
"It works", she observes, "it worked for us".
Shouldn't Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools that are mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The school's excellent results speak for themselves; but the education policies within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his huge support for bilingual education cloud the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
While he is in favor of immigrants learning English, Mr. Obama recently dismissed the issue as trivial when he proclaimed that we all need to stop debating the wording of laws in the English language.
"Instead", he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the education models that work, rather than dismissing them as insignificant or irrelevant.
Oil Net Falling Following New Worries in the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people feared that the bailout of the financial markets would be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures trading, down 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange, at the close of trading this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are once again worried despite the agreement on the largest bailout in history, reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was tempered by recent concerns that the crisis would be long-lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will acquire the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic weekend negotiations that culminated in the bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorated, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The outlook for overall equity, interest rates and exchange markets has become uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that the raw materials will not escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the US virus would spread globally and in particular, in China".
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls due to the slowdown in economic growth, and were therefore forced to lower oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20 per cent.
The Decisive Second Season Party for the Team's Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons in the Jets' uniform longer than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, the defense thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into a blast.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second half started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played dirty under a dark cloud.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to pass to Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon in which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds into the half.
"I didn't go out of my zone", Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think".
While Favre and Coles were wrestling, the defense was beating Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a fumble and made it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens got the ball out of the park because of Warner.
In the latest twist, the loss of the Bowens ball might just be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scoring on a 20-yard run to take a 34-0 lead.
That was the best the Jets have scored in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, when asked to describe this madness, said, "Second or third?"
When told both - the Jets gave up 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time".
Gebrselassie rested, breaking his world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again proved himself worthy of his title of the best distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first man to run 26.2 miles in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of a comfortable race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat by 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26 held last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, maintaining an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds.
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted to distance runners, have contributed to the decrease of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered from calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed training for a week.
Obviously, the rest has kept it shiny, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started doing it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better.'"
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's eastern African rival - for orchestrating his races too much, by shunning the world's marathon stars, actually counting on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the meaning of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a long-distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, led by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04 at half-way.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
With just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis is third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year by finishing seventh in 2:19:19.
The world record is held by Paula Radcliffe of England, who has a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikkoitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to compete in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a nice lead, then overtaking them about 18 miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city of part, the pride and trials of black life
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where pride and the complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black town to be incorporated, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, that description she gave in 1935 is not so easy to do today". "The town of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no jail".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the town she describes - which has become a tourist destination thanks to its inclusion in the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project's Florida tourist guide - is still a place of its own.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he's missing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the topic of race, many here remain cautious of the foreigners' gaze.
"We are very careful about how we tell the story", said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and the town's oldest parishioner.
"it must be in accordance with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It represents both a historic model of black power and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a focal point but also an example of black Southern rural culture - sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through such heartfelt, dialect-filled books as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this town, located just off of Route 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten heart of Florida, culminating in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was later divided into several private parts.
"Across the road on the left", she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and those well-maintained playgrounds which Howard Miller has always cared for, although he can hardly read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that "Lee Glenn" sells all kinds of drinks and anything that passersby can use.
So, in just over a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't really a portrait that everybody liked.
Zora described the reality well", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the young Johnson girls whom Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston used to arrive in town unannounced, in a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we pride ourselves on traditional attire.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"people were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he added, rocking in his chair from the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was likely baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a common grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, there's no big commemorations, no plaque for the general public to see.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A turning point came in the 1980's.
Orange County public officials wanted to bring a five-lane highway into the city, to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among so many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over race mixing led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white kids would come in and throw oranges or things at people sitting on the side", said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady has even passed away".
They threw a watermelon from their car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's application for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened young people's confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember that well - we used to kiss our master in the morning, and in the evening too", said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of the Eatonville Community Safety Group, a nonprofit.
This continued, she said, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural dividing line here", Ms Nathiri said.
Civil rights, by the way, has helped to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as herself, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as, "How can they deny themselves the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's unmarked grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed best-selling biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway reintroduced her to the American canon.
The highway project came at just the right moment when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began to hold a Hurston Festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's opening two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
"The five-lane highway fiasco, extremely fast, a real civic pride", said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up by saying that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who's been attending our church since 1993, started coming in large numbers, and residents were starting to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic district since 1998.
A single-theme library (of course named Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful, renovated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Now we have 90 percent black people)
Foreigners who come to learn about Eatonville's history, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
Most interviews require permission, and some things -- like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields -- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher with a penchant for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hard-working, crazy and mixed as the other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is genuine civic affection in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police force, which needs additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, they seem to have learned the description of Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think 'oh, this town is nothing compared to others'", Alondra Kenon said after the Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take a moment to contemplate the history, it's a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
But nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstand and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that in the glass and beehive offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, are having the worst "day at the office" since the 1929 crash.
Delivery men continue to sneak around the sidewalks with their muffin carts and trays for the morning meetings.
The Latino still roams the apartment buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts suspended from a yoke on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from the street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until that afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I found that at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in line.
Not at the cashier's desk, not to take out cash or make a deposit, but at the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for directions to Macy's, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all standing in line for the same reason I was standing in line.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took their money out of savings accounts called thrifts, credit unions, and the kind of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and say they treat customers like family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 bank, has gone bankrupt, and as New Yorkers went home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 million in savings accounts, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, terrified of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank they feel is trustworthy, the one that does the most bailouts on Wall Street.
Some average New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I could hear a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its thin CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery.
She said to me after my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any more risks".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria sway to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques with red stripes.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, a week after far-right parties won the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, in an organized action.
The criminals painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves; however, detectives believe this may have been done to disguise the extremists' hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be somehow related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said it was "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred just as the holy month of Ramadan was coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign, some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties try to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, as evidenced by the majority of young voters who made a difference, because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have barred glam rock star Gary Glitter from child sex abuse and deportation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month banishment on Glitter after he told the authorities who had him under control that he intended to travel to Spain via France.
Kent Police granted this travel ban last Thursday after proving to the magistrates that Glitter was guilty of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in the Ashford limited court, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Court, Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time".
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not report his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss any specific cases or Glitter's potential movements in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as well as those of the foreigners.
"We think it's easier to monitor someone who is staying in the UK because we have devices that can deal with any potential risks much more efficiently.
"Protecting Kent residents is the highest intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimise potential risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to go to London.
Thai authorities blocked him at passport control, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry and he was forced to return to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officers insisted he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his solicitor, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge, West London, Magistrates' Court to register him on the list of those accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for possession of child abuse images.
A source at the Ministry of Interior said Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Interior was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes that would make you feel bad.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to achieve the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On one side is the artist.
The other, the person.
Separate but in the privacy of those moments unknown to the public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer combines in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the program of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which grows every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of the personality of these artists, you don't take pictures on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the flamenco stars' personality moments with my camera".
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer started in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, resemble classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about the dancing or the singing itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has developed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment longer or shorter.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the Rue de la Mata (a street parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he is writing is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in unknown places and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to push forward the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival in Segovia, that the novel that is currently occupying him "is a real daring" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it", he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people marching through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize by a majority vote of the participants, was a sell-out at the Juan Bravo Theater.
The Festival's host, Félix Romeo, found himself facing a fascinated audience that had not seen the hour passed during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "thirst for reading" and "living new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and reviewing part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced how his vocation and memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, a fleeting experience", Vargas Llosa said, adding that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike", as writers were asked "not to be frivolous" and to take up their calling.
Poor weather ruins the fair in Pozoblanco
The flag-raising party that concluded the bullfighting at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning after the bull riders checked that the bullring was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather was bad for the fair, as two of the three fairs were cancelled.
On Saturday, rain prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bullfight.
The poster showed José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the Castilblanco arena.
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
That afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded from two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight with the bull itself.
Worse for El Juli, who entered the arena of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bullfight, after a much better fight, he was booed by most of the audience.
Police check of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
It's ten to five in the morning.
Traffic control by the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two attempt to flee.
His cargo, over two tons of hash, enough to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information leaked by the Basque Government's Interior Department.
The individual arrested was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials from the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting a vehicle check on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the inspection began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers away on the sidewalk, where the two occupants got out to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying, which they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The vehicle was loaded with balls of hashish from the rear, and then they took it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "forged" because it did not coincide with the one written on the van's grey card, which is also why they charged the detainee with a misdemeanor of forging documents.
Erzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The prisoner, A. A. J., 28, has been remanded in custody to complete the various steps and will be tried in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her do some strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California State Patrol who spoke to People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was pushing the accelerator hard, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled over on her sunglasses".
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear pull up in the middle of the highway and step out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was concerned for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented", which is why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol testing center.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, though "based on the officers' initial observation, we believed Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked at approximately 7pm and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from the Arizona State Hospital where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation that will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making special treatment to his family members.
"In such cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take responsibility", Llamazares said of the political party's behaviour in the Seville city council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for investigations to be "transparent" for irregularities that Silva may have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases to have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also pointed out that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Blood of Mayo, the bold gamble of Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreated the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film, which is over two and a half hours long, Sangre de Mayo will be released in cinemas next Friday, and will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of over four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós' literature, assures that he has realized with this filming "a childhood dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundredth anniversary of the 2 May in Madrid, something that he always accepted when the narrative was in line with national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid municipality is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate sets and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been wrongly led to fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost his entire career.
The director of Volver a empezar influenced his usual way of working, the staging of actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shoot and whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, by Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French Billiard Tables" and finally the winner, "Los turnipillos ciegos", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this film, Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're working for prosperity, and now you're just making one more movie", says Garci after more than 30 years in the industry.
Isabelle Bayón is the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville will pay tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three she went to live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two world wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me".
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
For example, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" of some tangos.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my dancing was identical to hers", she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with her who was his student.
"Matilde is turning Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy that she has agreed to play a part in my work and this honors me".
The production was also made possible by the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this genre of artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think that these are the women who have had a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and appreciates her work", says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8: 30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre .
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" concludes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennae Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennate Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
Similarly, the Andalusian Ministry of Culture bought 800 copies of the "Diary of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America is less pleasant without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them".
That's from Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absent-Male", and it's a good illustration of the desperation of American cinema, and of America as a whole, at the stark idea that Newman is no longer with us.
He barely got an Oscar.
It hadn't been on the air since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes one's feelings are beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend", Robert Redford lamented, "my life and my country were better because of him".
No one was afraid of making a fool of themselves or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and of the nation died during a particularly dark time, when terrorists and the stock markets are feared, the esteem of Americans has fallen to a low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and there's no reason to live, all that's left for human beings is admiration, and you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was the embodiment of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was an enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, such as the Anti-Drug Foundation created in honor of his eldest son who died from an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had struggled to take a stand against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond had died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar high", said George Clooney, who may be the only person today who is trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious and objective private life.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful despite the many opportunities to be unfaithful.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house when I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly watches his daughters meet his fans on earth, something that's not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than of being a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and philanthropist", he says.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, it could be realized in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take yesterday's race as an example, we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination grade.
But let's take a closer look at everything from the beginning.
Mistakes start with the backswing pulling, which forces you to go in early.
It's not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for shopping).
Well , no , I 'm not .
They used to make you go there only to get the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small sized jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Except for the fact that you have to go in early to get the microchip, the line is 15 minutes long, and you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait was over 35 minutes, which is unfathomable considering that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line, the competition started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once we did, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebellions and raids of the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, won't even be in the rankings with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to name an example of a perfect race, it would be the one I would not have in mind.
So I think we can still dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference Microsoft was introduced to a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Using a camera and a face-recognition system, the "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - including remembering their positions - and listen and hear the key words in their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the introduction video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asked if she was here to visit someone and said she would answer in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
That's really impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, like the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about more than just a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it won't have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of the useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft has been adding features and "extras" to Windows version after version.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, their operating system is losing importance but so is their software.
When Google Chrome first came on the web, I was one of those who subscribed to the theory that Google Chrome was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, since it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It is the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
I did.
It will never go away but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the Internet browser.
You turn on the computer just to run Firefox, or Explorer, or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than they do looking at windows.
Who are half of the applications provided with the system?
The more the merrier.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much fewer than Vista.
Less heavy, less busy, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, and I'll give you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week, there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or maybe in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more like a computer.
But with the Android launch delayed and the iPhone already on the market, it's going to cost them.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it is part of the outfit of the Association of Gay Muscular Men.
And if we were to list all his appearances, we could also mention the big, bearded man who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a cotton, sleeveless, man-shaped sweater.
The English call it a tank, but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among the rest.
First, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since he is named, according to legend, after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small (hardly recognizable) Belgian flag on the neck of the most popular body suits.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand doesn't just make tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweatshirts, cotton pants, baby clothes, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her enormous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion business very seriously.
According to Monica, they're not just beautiful, famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is your new collection based on for Mango this fourth season?
We love the movies of the '50s and '60s and we draw a lot of inspiration from them for our collections.
I love to walk around town and observe women, see how they're dressed, how they match their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl I loved clothes, and I wanted to go to my grandmother's house and look in my aunt's closet and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
Dancers like to dress up for classes and tests, so they can look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
So everything is connected.
You've had 30 years lately: has that been hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than I ever have, and I'm looking forward to my 30 years.
I find that women are more mature, have more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was little and it's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you thinking about becoming a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body is asking me to be a mother, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies. You're waiting for the various movies you shot last year to come out.
I can't wait for them to get out.
I'm a woman from the theatre, I'm very anxious and anxious, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I can't wait for the release of the movies "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ".
See what you think.
A few days ago, you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don 't say that !
I didn't get on the catwalk to model.
So, just to be clear, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite a while, to invite me to go to London for a charity run for her charity to support women, and the clothes we were exhibiting - I was exhibiting two of our collections that we had created for Mango - were being auctioned off to raise money for Naomi's charity.
People like Naomi is a very sweet person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, so many things are not true.
And I'm fascinated by this beautiful side of Naomi.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the hair, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Repeat offenders of drunk driving will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Ministry of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a drunken state, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him courses in road rehabilitation.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation will be involved in this initiative.
Statistics show that between 30 and 75 percent of all drivers arrested for drunk driving more than once take their car back.
The Alcohol Lock would prevent this since it is a system plugged into the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe first; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the permitted one.
The cost is over 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 lives every year.
This measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done through ordinary channels, but reform through criminal channels requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, which is the body responsible for the implementation of the directive.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At exactly 5.40pm, the official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was about to set, but its rays still forced me to put my hand in a visor so I could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other officials were present.
A few hours before I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Ah, very well, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time of the...
- No, no sir, I'm Spanish but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military line of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, on the other hand, has her hair down, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before entering the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate for presenting a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no living cartoonist more extraordinary and well-lived than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
It is the second largest store in Europe, with a total area of 1,335 square metres.
The first shop is in London.
The events, together with the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us meet at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the Chagals family's extraordinary table next to it, Mango's presidential table looked even more spectacular.
With a heavy heart and against the odds, because of her brother's recent death, Nati put on a Mango dress and some breathtaking ELAH jewelry, and arm in arm out with her son Luis - a handsome man of almost two meters tall - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without their coats because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pair of pants and a T-shirt from her own collection - and who for dinner transformed herself into a sexy long black dress - was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and, remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Ines Sastre did not stay for the tour of the palace premises, but she showed us before on her cell phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez, another handsome man who travels on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry skies of Paris.
Oh, that's the life.
1001, the stress-relieving number
There are not only 1,000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they're all listed in a book that will bring relief to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock that rings at 7:00 a.m. almost makes us sad, but it is even more so when we consider the hectic pace of life that we are living today.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods for combating daily fatigue and the problems associated with the world of work.
But 1001, not one more, not one less.
In addition to yoga poses, traditional massage and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has compiled a 'menu' of methods adapted to the tastes and times of each person.
The stress-relieving book is entitled "1001 Ways to Relax" and will be shipped directly from Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to find peace of mind in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' contradicts such a belief.
In addition, this book offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline isn't coursing through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk in the night.
I'm not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk in their sleep.
It may surprise you the first time it happens, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking in the night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitation.
It's an understudied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet, small voice, with isolated words, whispers or with shouting, crying, long speeches...
If sleepwalking becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to see if there is a problem that is causing much anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a mild disorder, so there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So look for games that are not violent, and avoid TV programs that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will help the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepiness starts to appear, try to stay calm.
Remember, they are harmless to the child and the next day he will have no memory of what happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's no use, because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests so.
Remember, if he shows signs of severe anxiety repeatedly, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to find out what is causing the child so much anxiety.
If you understand what he is saying (which is unusual), do not be tempted to ask questions to get information.
You'll get nothing, because in sleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Also, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and draw conclusions from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to learn his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, this is not a bad thing, it's just an episode that lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern has finally found the path to victory on its own turf after a long period of famine.
Without a big game, the Yellow and Blacks created the most chances and managed to turn one of them into a game winner.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who was near the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern would take the slightly ascending and turn to Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn on top, Roman from the tip of the foot or Diebold would come to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and just left the agitating Riahi at the top of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two opportunities signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take a ball thrown back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd).
But the Illusians winner won't be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not know how to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Illhousian Eleven who just backed up a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game when, after a big mess, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy in the face of angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
The President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with practical proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with a general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to obtain measures to deal with the soaring price of diesel fuel, which has reached a record high of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the spokesman for the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them the solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of seamen".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not stopped.
A sealing dam was put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination by burning tires and paddles in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel sides, such as the Sands d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers were docked, and the Havre, where some 20 boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, have stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
The people of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for the meeting of Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
The "crisis committee" at Guilvinec must decide on Tuesday what action to take against the movement and whether to attend the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials from the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up anything" and "do not want to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the fisheries committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the threshold of profitability of a boat is only reached with a diesel fuel of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the wonderful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes all paid tribute to the film legend and the actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is on track to deliver 215 planes this year despite the threat of recession that is looming over the world economy.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its forecast for deliveries in 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of Embraer.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is hoping for a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG is considering divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been bailed out by the U.S. Treasury, plans to sell off more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it has been owed, reports the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to consider selling most of its business beyond its international life insurance and US pension business, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG is considering divesting include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly cash in to repay the $85 billion loan it received from the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders.
The first of these is the "Historical Analysis of the Paris Morning Meeting"
The New York Stock Exchange fell a historic low Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped 777.68 points to 10365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the technology-dominated index, fell 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the start of the session, Wall Street plunged after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to rescue the banks that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the representatives denied Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to pass a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan", she added, fearing that a project adopted in a few days would be "too late".
"If the plan is indeed moribund . . . then the relay will have quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And adding to the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms Piegza said.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking business to be bought out by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis", added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has gone up.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3,632 percent from 3,827 percent Friday night, and the 30-year yield fell to 4,161 percent from 4,357 percent the night before.
Obama, the winner of the first televised match by points
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another debate to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that was reportedly watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to reverse his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
Gallup, whose poll released Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49 percent versus 44 percent for McCain), said the Democrat had pulled the plug.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won with 39% of the votes, while 25% of them gave victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts", warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently touted his unquestionable foreign policy experience, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on the issues that were at the heart of that first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that"... he has accused repeatedly.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he added.
A sharp angle of attack that's been hammered into Republican TV commercials since yesterday.
President Obama said he represented the future.
Without being disassembled, he was concise and precise.
He has put his ability to make the right decisions and restore America's image in the world.
"McCain still hasn't figured it out, while Obama has", said a Democratic spot this weekend, blaming the Republican for not fully appreciating the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama denounced, yesterday, to 20,000 people gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "working class". The financial debacle clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the man most likely to save the economy from the edge of the abyss.
"The coming week could be a watershed moment", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that he would still be able to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street boost, the Illinois senator also said that achieving eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, has called for a 45-power nuclear power plant by 2030.
Both candidates have been cautious in avoiding questions about the $700 billion bailout package passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
Ask Min, "you noticed that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on the central square of Minsk on Sunday evening as the polling stations were closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the elections.
While no results had been announced yet, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admitted that they did not even vote: "No problem, they can do whatever they want with my vote", said one youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has been favoured by foreign observers in its attempt to regain contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections were deemed clean by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting", lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
'It is a cosmetic change,' says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, 'because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive.
If opposition members enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean TV space, regional meetings and bill proposals".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because 'the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis, and we don't reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that the turnout figures appear to be too high and that the widespread use of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all kinds of manipulation.
"You noticed that there was an election, did you?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones best suited to power".
The silence of the night falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulated the team on their success.
The interview - blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood donors in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the trust of the public who had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood supply operated by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service was contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In view of this tragedy and the public outcry, the Government of Canada in February 1994 instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Justice Krever was delayed in presenting his report, some provinces then formed a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Company to supply all the other provinces and the two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38 per cent of people had confidence in the blood system in Québec", recalls Dr Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we regained the public's trust", she said, before proudly stating that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
From its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, Europe was witnessing the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been prevalent since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
The main recommendation of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures should be introduced.
In April 1999, blood was thus refused to those who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But in recent years it has been proved beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This incident showed us that the precautionary principle was a good one".
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV test technique was introduced: the nucleic acid test (NAT), which detects the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of donors, rather than the antibody against the virus, which was the basis of the tests used until then.
The TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends from the time the person is infected to the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, she says.
We were able to reduce that to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors may be infected without being aware of it and thus not be detected.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one person in every 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before anyone can be infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before there is a case of HIV transmission from a blood product.
I believe that today people can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing blood transfusions to restore their health", says the CEO of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island. Like the West Nile virus, it is transmitted by blood from an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr Décary, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for an adequate supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be refilled in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which comprises on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation".
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria may still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they grow older and are no longer able to donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is even more difficult to stop them from donating blood and to encourage them to become regular donors.
"The rush of life today is such that we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and are planning to collect more than a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the USL First Division Semifinals via a 3-1 win over the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and midfielder Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
The Impact lost their first game of the home-and-home series on Friday, 2-1, at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, just outside Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder closed a 3-1 deficit in the second half to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still went on to the semifinals 5-4 on aggregate.
The Impact are scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's winning goal
The number one Canadian trio are ready to begin the season.
The unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led off the attack in a 3-2 home-and-away win for the Canadiens against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the tricolor in six preliminary matches.
Kovalev won the game by scoring the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another match to feel comfortable".
"He tried to do too much in the first half", said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a big ovation".
Charest to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
"Pushing back the limits of our last great northern frontier" was the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was a sort of image mill.
Loops of spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by Google Maps, maps, and so on were shown on three huge screens.
Big money, like in an election.
In a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call the elections this autumn, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour force agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - had never been presented before.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a timetable, investment amounts, or precise priorities for future projects.
At most, there are a few avenues of what could be developed further: hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's list.
This territory twice the size of France is our home, it's in Quebec.
It's not just in our house, it's in us", he insisted, as if to make clear that he was calling for a national founding myth.
He said that Quebec had built up a lot in its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"This is ours, this is our future", he added, after taking a theatrical pause to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the premier said at the press briefing.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government", he said.
The European Union is also working to ensure that the EU's fishing fleet is able to compete with the world's fishing fleet.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister feels that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people who live in the land, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP for Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has a prominent place, started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment where "we will give each other a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "consistent, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal Prime Ministers before him.
"Like the Liberals before us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power station the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has forged the future", said Jean Charest.
In a press conference he cited another, more conservative, reference to the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Mr Charest also spoke about the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, which was due to be commissioned in 2012.
"It's just between us, but I'm planning to be there", he told his supporters, prompting a standing ovation.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, including a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that went like a letter in the mail: the PLQ in particular demands the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to give them a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
The main lines of the Nord Plan were greeted with scepticism by the opposition.
The Leader of the Pequiste Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy which the Landry government had launched in 2001.
The Liberal government, she said, had given up on the law when it came to power in 2003.
The Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, said that the EU had to be more flexible in its approach to the problem of the environment.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is for it not to be just a show", said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A country dishonoured
Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironically) in the Harper cabinet, last summer said that Louise Arbour was a "shame" on Canada.
To cast such a reproach on a woman who has waged a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved which has not repatriated its own citizen locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the alleged acts.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and lets a child soldier languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be noted that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture, no matter how psychologically damaged a young adult may be, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the word Harper keeps using and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government leader who has so far been in the minority (so what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that stands for Truth, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free thought - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17 issue, The Debtor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million defamation suit against three authors and a small publishing house with no money in order to start a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in cases of libel prosecution, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely overlooked by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to take a position contrary to his own.
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to bankrupt the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was to the public that she should have presented her version of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, debates in Canada are normally held through the exchange of ideas and not by the use of clubs.
The mine had to open its books and files and start a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and has been rebuffing petitions and letters in support of Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate and disregard the opinions of that same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only refers to the highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that's a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even the detractors have a say.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who support Black Canada's authors and publishers do so primarily because they reject the brutal way the mine is run.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a lawsuit-bail (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a notice to the authors of Black Canada telling them to stop using this term ...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surrealist rhetoric, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic inquiry and the pursuit of truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in its entirety, the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that are unpleasant to the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under the threat of repeated prosecutions, who will do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long known how to handle debate and disagreement and resolve conflict.
Barrick Gold's out-of-bounds lawsuit makes it clear that, contrary to its claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to academia, as well as to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democrat, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to contain the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides for: better control by elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress toward a deal that will be effective in the markets", said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done in a way that shielded the real economy and ordinary Americans from the crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"This is the bottom line: if we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had been sped up in the last few hours over fears of the effect of a further failure on investor sentiment.
The deadline we agreed on was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidency, who were late to join the negotiations, were rather favourable to the agreement, but expressed their dissatisfaction that it had to come to this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has claimed credit for adding provisions to the agreement, including one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and one on the salaries of executives of businesses bailed out by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of irresponsibility, there is no room for complacency.
But these measures are necessary", he said on US television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The big lines I read [showed] that this is something that we're all going to have to digest and we're going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan is to use taxpayers' money to buy back the bad, unsafe and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the liquidation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who threw the first draft of the agreement last week.
We think we've gotten out of this deadlock since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of troubled companies should only be insured by the government, rather than bought.
To round off the corners for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stating that if the government were to take losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for a first instalment of 250 billion, with a further 100 billion to be paid if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be approved by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get shares in the bailed-out companies that will pay dividends if it makes a profit and that it can sell back when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings concerning housing attached to the mortgages covered by this plan, and to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to a vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be approved.
Yesterday, there were still voices against the bill, both Republican and Democratic.
"Obviously, Washington is not listening to you", said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is about taking advantage of taxpayers".
The leader of a small congressional group dubbed the "skeptics caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to say: we ask the Congress not to rush and to consider carefully the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up acquiring its bankrupt rival since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
'This is not money wasted,' said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get back a vote in the bank and influence.
This is something that savers and households are enjoying now that times are uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed to be on its way to nationalizing another bank that had been battered by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (US$ 75.5 billion) in mortgage loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an iconic and committed
Her blue-eyed beauty was her strong suit for a long time, some might say her weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the fountain will also have kept him away from the power register that breeds true sacred monsters.
But what a great distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last remaining icons of the golden age of American cinema.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on screen, more careful in his playing, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the brilliance of dramatic conventions.
Interbreeding often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No ego, the ultimate in quality.
Because in him was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, on television, soon in cinema.
This same civil rights activist was also the race car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, dubbed a sex symbol, though he was part of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadows of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic to the sparkles of show business, whose enigma has not been fully deciphered, also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has sent a shiver through movie audiences this weekend as his iconic roles collide on the silver screen of remembrance.
Over half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual flux is marching through it.
The cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) is brought back to mind, as the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Tennessee Williams' 1958 adaptation of The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
Closer to Us (1990), it is about his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all its promises.
So many Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, the delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable character in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he reprised the character on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages, that was him.
It's him again.
The ages are jostling through its course.
Young people know him best through the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of a less orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish mob in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the circle was closed.
Unlike many movie legends who left the business early enough, Newman would remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its whims and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to the underplaying judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been easy for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles have long been a no-brainer.
He played the young leaders less often than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drift and revolt.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true, unassuming sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He lost his son Scott to an overdose and dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the tributes that poured down on Newman yesterday, his good friend and former fellow soldier Robert Redford (they had acted together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sadly: "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the late actor.
Beyond his legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a critic of the Hollywood excesses, is also gone.
Many have seen the beetle sitting on sauces, sauces, biscuits, and other food, judging the process to be rather bad-tasting, though initially profitable.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters that included these words: "From the beginning to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it's been a privilege for us to have followed the journey of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen, in short.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company have made in their factory of invoices ?
The hearings on the ongoing criminal case against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and regularly, having caused particularly significant damage.
According to the prosecution, the money from the grants was being spent for personal use, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and the municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went to the cash registers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and to the pockets of certain individuals.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money for the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices for costs, behind which no real service was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large proportion of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books from the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
The names of companies that were to appear on the invoices were decided, among others, during the tours in the province of the North of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the witness's statement, he was supposed to be tracking down guesthouses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the basis of which they prepared the other invoices that they would submit, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
In a "scouting tour", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided food for a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy the place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which later became known as Egypt's Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors in form and substance.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj actually had only three rooms and could accommodate up to ten people, but the bill mentioned 130 guests.
The fact that the applicant had not been informed of the existence of the undertaking, and that the Commission had not been informed of the fact that the undertaking had been registered, does not mean that the Commission had not been informed of the existence of the undertaking.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew right away that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly placed on the stamp".
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people stayed there, also did not fit, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
And the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time".
The eager invoice-issuers also did not inquire about the Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but only arranged trips abroad, and so they naively indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, whereas services relating to travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel at the request of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services did not bear VAT of 25%, as stated, but VAT of 15%.
The investigation of the public prosecutor revealed that the 'issuers' also made mistakes in mentioning the transport of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it was also for formal defects, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued on behalf of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont were found to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó Sporting Stage, both of which deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued in their name.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home.
Invoices made intentionally
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, has drawn up an invoice to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért foundation, for the sum of HUF four million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was made to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, cooperated with the Zuschlags and in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but no services were actually provided.
There was no financial movement either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The next category of invoicing companies is those directly related to the defendants.
The administrative deputy of the general manager of the company Delta Trió Kft. dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he was not to be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and de Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their counter value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He nevertheless made use of these companies, since at the request of Mr Zsolt Szente, the co-accused and draftsman of the foundation acts of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, in the name of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave to the agencies a total of 15 invoices issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, with a value of HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices and the VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices which were used in the context of the grant application of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted an application for a grant to the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for the amount of two HUF 500 000 but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
In fact, these are the invoices that were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will describe the method of manufacturing the invoices, as they had already done before the prosecution.
What could be really interesting would be if the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decided to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether, possibly, the socialists would have reached an agreement that in return for the reimbursement of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would be the sole bearer of the burden.
Today, the latter is probably annoyed, since the requests for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a lighter detention conditions, are continuously falling on deaf ears.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic crimes, are walking around freely or at least waiting in their own homes for the end of the proceedings.
The psychology of over-bid: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overvalue the merchandise.
Neuroscientists and economists at the City University of New York have succeeded in uncovering the neurological and economic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings don't want to be left out of this kind of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that's why they're even willing to pay a price that's too high.
This research has attempted to construct a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while the researchers analyzed the active brain regions of the experimental subjects using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction, one key element of which is the overbid of a third, the whole underneath the brain stem, called the striatum, would be set in motion intensely when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Hence, the researchers believe that the reason for the price increase is the flight of the striatum's violent reaction.
In support of their theories, the economists in this group of researchers carried out analyses of financial surveillance.
In these, three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the real value of the product in question, and they carried out their bet.
Another group was promised that if they won the game, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
Whereas the third group got this $15 before the auction, but the members of the group also lost this money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the emphasis in the one was on winning, while in the other, on failing.
In proof of the neurologists' hypothesis, the "against failure" team members were willing to bet higher than the control and "for victory" teams.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Each of them explained the phenomena observed at auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the risk-taking.
It was only the techniques of neurological imaging that helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories and now lead to a third explanation". - Andrew Schotter, professor at the New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is listed as the leading cause of death.
An estimated 100,000 people in Hungary are infected with hepatitis, but only 7,000 are receiving treatment because they often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is a general name for infections of the liver caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms, such as inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the pathogens and the underlying diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, are spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, usually accompanied by a general bad state of health, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then, visible yellowing develops on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stools become lighter, and the urine becomes darker in color.
Around the world, a million people die every year from the most serious forms of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people with the disease do not know they have the virus because the pathogenic gene silently destroys the liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 to 30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as is regular screening.
The contamination rate is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
Currently, an estimated 200 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory testing, it is advisable to consult the treating physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating the risk of contagion and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral liver cirrhosis, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does believing in God make you feel less pain ?
According to the results of a recent study, religious belief is a kind of painkiller, which has already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph reported that researchers at Oxford University had conducted an interesting experiment to determine how belief in God could influence the human tolerance of pain.
In this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks as each of them looked at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the suffering.
It was also discovered that by using a technique of palpation of the human brain, Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments involving academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment is conducted in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and distributing the electric shocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to look at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a sort of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not unlike the first, was based on its calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four successive sessions, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that seeing the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", "cared for", and "calmed down, and peace came over them".
When they saw the religious painting, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was involved in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, among atheists, provided the appropriate image is found.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases does change our personality", Wright added.
After these excellent results, the only question left is what would be the effect on the regulation of the subjects' pain if we showed the faithful a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would a better quality Virgin Mary be more effective?
You are what you reveal about yourself
On its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found in the back of people's pockets as well as the sky above their heads - where they spent their holidays, what experts they consulted and what their interests are.
But that's not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
As for the skeptics drawing a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror, they are missing the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to collect even more information about its users, which is necessary for the founders of Google to meet their original goal which was: "Let's collect all the world's information in one system!".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global switching work, they are still just at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What job would be best for me?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, which is simple at first glance, once they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiated the search and the pages subsequently consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous declarations and our stored preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what I do? users ask, worried about Google's monopoly on information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can cause a backlash among Internet users.
It is a confirmed fact, however, that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most notable recent example is the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google passed information it had collected from the public page called Orkut to the Brazilian government, allowing for identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May when Google, in a showdown with the Electronic Legal Defense Fund, proved its right in court against the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will not be able to be obliged by any constitutional provision to disclose information on the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier, but ultimately failed to obtain the private user search lists, or the entire list of websites and keywords for the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is being reprimanded by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their privacy and private sphere is being affected when they start using Google services, and therefore they attack them in the spirit of revolt against multinational corporations that pride themselves on their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savages" of computer enthusiasts, activists and enthusiasts appearing in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "technology corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which is being labeled as the world invader because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification codes, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very clearly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is pulling behind it.
The Web 2.0 is really about collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind us, and using the communication channels that are available to us, and while the dimensions of these channels change one by one, the essence remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can have a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and they can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing their music habits. Then they can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa appear automatically.
While there are many examples, such as the girlfriend who can easily understand the morning photos taken by the circle of mutual friends with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one thing is certain: the term privacy is totally to reconsider these days.
Who lives an online life, is what he shows about himself, and that's how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
If you want to hide something, or at least try to circumvent Google's monopoly, you can (by starting with, for example, Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
Google's online services, from word processing to image processing to reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not tied to huge server parks and which do not bring together our best profile, which has existed to date.
The public is waiting, not really hiding from it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, now valued at $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the advertising agencies' revenues, while the services introduced at an increasing rate are causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft but for many other computer programmers.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of corporate motherboard and after the company deemed too expensive the daily multiple catering, taken at any time. All this seems ridiculous compared to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are not announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years they will shake the world in new ways. While some think that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble at its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous test results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database could provide a good raw material for the next generation of science fiction writers.The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written in Orwellian half-tones, depicts a future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google's data.
Two miners helped to cover up the double murder of Ózd
"The police have summoned two minors for questioning in the case of the double murder of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to cover up the traces of the crime". - said the spokesman of the police department of Borsod.
The young men have admitted the facts against them, and so far they have been charged with complicity.
The two miners, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are defending themselves free.
Conspiracy to murder carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a local 23-year-old, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with intent and self-interest.
During the investigation, it was discovered that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and that's why he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the man's little girl, aged 9 years.
According to the information from the MTI, the young man had premeditated his crime, as evidenced by the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene.

The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange's stock.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State which is seeking to divest itself of more than 60% of its shares within a few months of operation.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish bid represents the highest bid that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new owner the worst, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts at between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 per cent of the shares, followed by the bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis as seen by the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse by the day, the leading European newspapers are already talking about a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president", the Rome daily La Repubblica accused. "The president was not even able to unite with his own party behind a hastily improvised bill to relieve a desperate situation"...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as the billionaire Warren Buffett once said, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 9/11.
Some in the Madrid press also see Washington as a scapegoat.
According to the view of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing every day, and eventually the whole world will pay the price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, yet according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatened, one that Washington did not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the balance, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer", says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still provide a lifeline to their shaky financial institutions, and with their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the financial resources nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the EU states to disregard their national selfishness and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - as the Viennese daily Der Standard reported, adding that fears that European taxpayers, too, will have to put their hands in their pockets, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which is like a tsunami, crossing the old continent in parts.
The 'saviours' should not immediately start throwing around a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in what cases it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent car mimics the flight of the drone
What better way to develop technology that can avoid an obstacle than to imitate an obstacle detector already in existence in nature?
Like the one with the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, buzzing bees have provided the strategic starting point for Nissan engineers to inspire how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C self-driving robotic system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee creates its own space, oval in shape, which in reality is very similar to our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the brand's research and development and public relations technology department.
The bee's multifaceted eye plays a vital role, as it is able to see in all directions, up to an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, engineers have considered the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an evasive maneuver immediately.
The sensing of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second, and then the mini-autobot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system that exists today, this avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not, the mini robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where collision is considered inevitable for the time being.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must be done in a heartbeat.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the endless combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotational motion, acceleration and deceleration as manoeuvres available to the mini robot car.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, making them longer-lasting than the Lithium-ion version.
Andoh's view is that the most important thing is the intelligent, instinctive response, not the processing of data, much less the ability to store it.
This mechanism must only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It does not need to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, and in this way it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need gigabyte capacity or even megabyte capacity of memory.
This is the first step towards the design of an instantaneous avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be introduced in mass-produced cars within the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even named the baby after the priceless
The written version of the $700 billion bailout plan, designed to buy back the banks' bad loans, and to use them in multiple ways, is ready.
In the first round, half of that sum will be spent.
Reuters reports that in further debate that lasted until after midnight Saturday, East Coast time, congressional leaders agreed on the days-long controversy surrounding the $700 billion bailout.
"We have taken a serious step forward", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, who said the only thing left to do was to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born of the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, commenting on the outcome of the compromise, said the program would work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented.
The written version of the plan was released before the opening of Asian markets at 8pm local time in Washington on Sunday (i.e. 2am local time in Central Europe on Monday) but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that will become the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and then the Senate will decide its fate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme also differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent in one go, for the purchase of securities on dubious loans.
Now, the maximum amount that can be spent is half of the $700 billion, the first $250 billion of which will be released immediately after the bill is passed by Congress, probably on Monday, the first of which will go to the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the Federal Reserve Chairman will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new act of Congress.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able to buy, at the same time, bad debt securities, mortgage securities and bad mortgages, as well as other types of 'toxic' debt.
The Ministry's officials stated that the purchases can be made through an auction or directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance scheme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that caused the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the tools necessary to allocate $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the large-scale redemption of bad loans, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system collapse one or the other major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary measures to be ready to apply the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who are in a bad position and are waiting for government help can expect that their severance pay, simply called the golden parachute over the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
The ceiling on wages is mentioned only in very specific cases, and the limits depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the enterprise.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury secretariat buys at auction, they'll levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Right after the buyback of the bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the rulers is not overstated.
To complete the picture, it should be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified, the ceiling only applies to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
"This is the first time in US history that there will be legal limits on the appointment of CEOs", said the chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be winners in the matter as soon as the economy and with it the banks rescued fall back on their feet.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will determine how losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, starting with the financial sector.
On both sides, there were those who expressed doubts about this plan.
"This is not what the American people mandated us to do, this is not protecting taxpayer dollars", said Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican from California.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks that it's the same people who are pushing for action that are responsible for the Wall Street crash.

The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing of products and chemicals sector (1.6%).
This resulted in a deflation in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), in the manufacture of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent) and a slight increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices of paper production, printing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of manufacturing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a large proportion of national industrial output, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales in the processing sectors, the most significant price increases (32.4%) were in the oil processing sector.
In the manufacture of metal products, there was a price increase of 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices rose by 11 per cent.
Price decreases were recorded in the textile and textile products manufacturing sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the machinery and electrical equipment manufacturing sector (0.3 per cent).

In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while those of the sectors producing energy and materials for further processing were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest increase was observed in the energy and materials for further processing production sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, inflation was 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-generating sectors, it fell by 1.4 per cent.
Industrial export sales prices, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they decreased by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7% against the euro and by 7.1% against the dollar, and compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Will we still need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement will come into force on or around January 12, the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of local Hungarian community leaders.
It is now all about the time when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the new system is fully implemented.
The Hungarian foreign minister will be in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have a meeting with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank bailout.
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bailout plan.
After days and days of marathon negotiations, representatives in Congress and the Administration announced early Sunday that they had reached agreement in principle on a plan to save the banks.
This funding plan, aimed at de-escalating the Wall Street crisis and the crippled credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves as each more qualified than the other to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polling, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to gain a small lead, while McCain's lead, which he gained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a columnist just after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages which he also supported.
"It is now time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your jobs, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing it . . . but doing nothing is not an option".
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the creation of a Treasury Board of Control and capping the severance pay of top executives, and that he was personally very attached to those points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right wing is intact, it is only in the party's core that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel talks about the low score of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black.
The Spiegel (Spanish)
In the online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article titled "The Revolution in Bavaria is devouring its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of the whole of Christian democracy and, therefore, also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely to have happened just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was at 47.7%, and for the first time since the 1950s, it was below the 50% mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the much-talked-about Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "eating its parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
The social scientists have been saying this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace, and yet the secularization, the educational outcomes and the settlement of the northern and eastern Germans in the developing Bavaria region could not remain unimpaired on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right wing is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of ordinary citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the bachelors and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com) is the
In its article 'Who, with whom, are the party leaders on the sidelines in the face of coalition questions', the conservative Austrian daily deals with the confused domestic political situation that has settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to talk to the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiations.
The elections have taken place, and now the coalition is the main issue; in the debates on public television, party leaders barely show their cards.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ president, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any event, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be fruitless if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the coalition is a completely open question for the moment.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"In order to avoid a coalition of the red and the black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities", Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, began in Paris.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP for the European People's Party Fidesz, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children the most and is therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the Fidesz PP group press office, Járóka warned that apart from the discrimination in hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market, primarily because of their low qualifications.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youths do not have a high school diploma, and as a result of a poor basic education, only a tiny fraction have the opportunity to obtain a higher education qualification".
The Commission has also been asked to present a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the Evaluation of Competition (EAEACEC) and to propose to the Council that the Commission should be able to submit a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the Evaluation of Competition (EACEC).
Investing in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economies of the European Union member countries.
The Commission's proposal is to make the European Parliament responsible for the implementation of the directive.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he contributes to the state budget.
"Because of their EU citizenship, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and protected from poor quality and sectarian education", stressed Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament and to the European Parliament.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunities guaranteed by democracy so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe", Járóka said.
In the name of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' for all, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken for equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination at European level and at the level of the Member States.
The Commission has decided to grant a transitional period of grace for the
The decision on the fate of the fallen Huber-Beckstein duo will be made in October
Despite this pitiful electoral defeat, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent of the vote, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this much-criticized pair, at any rate, made it feel that they did not particularly care about their seat.
This was used to appease the angry members of the faction and the rank and file, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Christian-Social Union won 60.7 per cent, whereas today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole sovereign" of Bavaria, contributing 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong presence in this southern region, which is crucial to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal party reorganisation, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as a possible successor to Huber, was also given a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates fumbling discussions with the FDP liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
It was a strange twist of fate that the list of Free Electors was used to introduce legislation for Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber was used as a possible coup by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then to deal ruthlessly with the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the CSU leadership is putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein somehow.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role.The former head of the regional government and former chairman of the CSU, has designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they somehow re-establish, with a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
The CSU's loss of ground will not negatively influence the grand coalition in Berlin, Merkel said, making it difficult to hide her disappointment with the fiasco.
This is a relative thing, however, because it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats is still ongoing.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst result with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukashenko and his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to irregularities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature in this country of 10 million people has been doing without opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting under the name United Democratic Forces (UDF) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time in a dubious election, following the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" some opposition members of parliament this time.
In this way, the ODSZ has abandoned its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly dependent on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are denied entry visas because of the anti-democratic Belarusian political order, was one of the opposition's expectations.
The fact that the OSCE, in evaluating the campaign, emphasised positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the prohibition on running for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a previous appeasement.
However, the OSCE press release on Monday already disputed the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is still feeling a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as separate from Georgia, while Russia, with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month already.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU", Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "the government was afraid to bring even one opponent into this parliament, which has no weight".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results, but instead is trying to get the message of economic reforms across to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns in this area: we have to print our opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting a stick in our sails in terms of distribution, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly people" - said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the retired who support it officially really do not consider it appropriate anymore.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evocating the silence of a cemetery', is now only a matter of time", Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in deeds".
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of Chigi Palace have we had revolving doors for employees to enter and exit.
But as of today, this new measure against the smart guys is in effect, against those who show up and then go to the bar to drink coffee during working hours.
The new anti-laziness policy was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
 The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services", says the Minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It is reformism", Brunetta stresses.
The installation in all the offices of the Presidency of the Council is completed by the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees was recorded, the Secretary-General assured: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
"A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution", says Brunetta, smiling.
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
The Minister said that "in three months, sick leave for public employees has fallen by 50%, or 60 thousand workers in one year".
He added that it was essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
The Minister explained that the Italian economy is "a dynamic one, in which wage dynamics - in the last 8-10 years - have doubled in relation to the private sector, and this is in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the norms of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today is presenting data on the decline in absenteeism from the workplace due to illness", writes the consumer association, "the population of 'active slackers' continues to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of honest and productive public employees have come together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the exclusion of additional allowances in the case of sickness due to service, the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home stay, during which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister are contested in the TAR.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: 'Prevention is crucial'
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were about 1,200.
The figures show the seriousness of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, causing almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this tragic issue, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of the Victims of Work Accidents, which is now celebrated on the second Sunday of October, in all the Italian provinces.
"The worrying data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace", says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of the maimed and disabled of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continuing effort of the association to promote prevention at the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the raising of public awareness.
"Naturally outraged, everyone has joined in to put an end to such tragedies which, by their scale, arouse the outcry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep an eye on this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
The House's President Gianfranco Fini stressed that "the phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive", said later Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"we don't want this 'discounting' to translate into in fact, a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, not enough is being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that counteraction can be done through multiple actions".
 According to us, more controls and inspections are needed, as is more intervention in the training of workers, and this from school".
- He added - "a further effort is needed in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed in the face of a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
 Mercandelli then denounced the "progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "deviation of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker back the guarantee of insurance", he added, "so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneity or the expansion of the legislator".
They point to the MP3 player, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent damage to hearing.
This is the message from the European Commission, which in a communiqué issued in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Unanticipated and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"This scientific report", we read in the footnote, "shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at high volume using portable music devices for more than one hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss.
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data", the EU official continued, "this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies.'
The independent scientific committee was asked by Brussels to look into the problem, given the intensive use of portable music equipment and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise it generates.
'The scientists confirm that there is good cause for concern and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week exceed the current limits for the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods of time risk permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
The Commission has therefore decided to send the Commission to Rome for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will be drawing up the Rome guidelines.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the 'official stamp' of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it", he emphasised, "and it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by the political decision-makers, which is the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping of roles, but only the will to have a corner to work out a grand project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappeared, because this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as indeed in Rome, I am sure that its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is burdened with the management of daily life and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look ahead, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The Mayor of Rome also stressed that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic group: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a single euro to the citizens of Rome, and will serve to study and involve the best minds that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, "a strategic reference frame is needed, neither firm nor immobile, to enable our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future in a unified spirit".
A future which, says the Mayor of Rome, "will not be confined to the usual municipal boundaries, but will look beyond the horizon - not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
A prominent American politician who is eager to pass himself off as an independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had dealings (as he still does today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date draws near.
A woman in Miami wrote on a website that "this person is full of ambition".
Obama's got some serious balls, he thinks he's gonna win the highest office in a nation that's got two black governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that say little; they are obviously racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president?
In this case, it's still someone who speaks from the heart and not from the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
And now, an aspect of the American mind that was kept secret until the end is emerging.
"Say what you will, we'll see ourselves as putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the black candidate's success seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people, what were the mistakes that Bush made during his presidency? 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes over for George W will have a huge job to do.
In the United States, the economic collapse is felt even by journalists: in the press, it is the time of suppression, and many blame the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
Also, the editing done in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of the papers, is a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is to be kept from shrinking significantly.
There is a clear but complex pessimism permeating American journalism.
Six in ten senior executives and journalists at print newspapers are convinced that journalism nationwide is going down the wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are forging a path to the Internet, which many see as the newspaper's "killer".
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by 79%.
All 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between who runs the newsrooms -- the editors -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
Some people say it has to do with "work safety".
The number of managers who think they'll lose their jobs within three years is 47% nationally.
As for the journalists, we're going to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a country as vast as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
Directors almost always get a big salary, while the editor can make 10 thousand dollars a month, plus retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, after a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the weather.
The Court of First Instance has held that the Commission's decision to impose a fine on a third party is not a manifest error of assessment.
The president of the second criminal division of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
At his trial last week, he was granted house arrest, which was converted into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence against him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon was already manifest a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this, reporting that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, which has made itself felt in a despotic way with the vote I mentioned at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the great changes, which the current economic earthquake is foreshadowing or already causing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been suppressed for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualisation, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, involve the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be global economically but politically it is almost only national.
Political internationalisation seems to be out of the question, or at least has little to say: the clear proof is provided by the European Union which, divided as usual between the various interests and the various national strategies, is unable to decide on a common policy.
And so it is from the government of each State that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a love of credits: when we go through a difficult period, it is only the States that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them - two invaluable resources, which no market or international organisation can ever have in a comparable way.
This new emphasis on the crisis of the nation-state is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the still greater importance which more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future would, on the contrary, have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather non-material things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than who is not, that is, who has the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second innovation, which, however, involves a break.
Which means territory, state, government, inevitably means politics, and therefore leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting of existing leadership, economic specimens that have proven inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And then, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of alienation that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now in their apogee, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership is underground, fuelling a powerful and widespread movement of delegitimisation of the ruling classes and the traditional political orders, which is manifested in the improvised electoral 'revolts' or, in the changes of collective mood of recent times, from the rise of the conservatives in Bavaria, to the fall of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the US Congress against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the Right in Italy did not come by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, are having more and more difficulty, which is not new, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially agitates in an exorbitant way.
In view of all this, to speak of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But as they say, keep your eyes wide open, and for good reason.
Superglue for walking on walls.
Defying the laws of gravity with super glue and, in the future, walking on walls like Spiderman.
That is the goal of various American research centers, and today a team of four institutes is almost there.
With a glue measuring just one square inch [2.5 cm], researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of the ones we know of that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko's feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that provide the animal with a perfect grip.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, it is easily detachable from the wall", says Lim Daiing, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe it's for walking on walls like Spider-Man? Maybe it is, but the researchers are thinking about a much less fascinating use, such as connecting between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at this time.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, researchers in California presented a hairlike microfiber adhesive that cleans itself of dust when moved across a surface to ensure perfect and consistent adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juice.
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, warns of the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, when taken in conjunction with certain medicines. At the American Chemical Society's 236th National Meeting in Philadelphia, he is sounding a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, negating their beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has been heavily criticized for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-aging and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
The Italian Medicines Agency itself had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to be careful what they drink, if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit medication.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, head of the pharmacology department of the Public University of Milan: "these findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international agencies of medicines who will have to change the information notes of the medicines if necessary.
It is always advisable to read the instructions for the medicines you are taking and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but clearly contact the doctor or pharmacist", the expert stressed to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in economics is awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and the localisation of economic activity.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a well-known op-ed columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, in the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy, and which was blamed on economics for years, but which has now been proved correct.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public's attention", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "highly valued economist" but also a "very aggressive" publicist, particularly critical of the excesses of Bush administration liberalism.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today is the release of OpenOffice.org.3, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the more popular Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year's work by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office package is presented to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some specific functions for certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
It is also possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents which combine the typical graphic of the Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the elaboration of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of the features of OpenOffice to the web (on the cloud), and in the next few weeks, they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can be sent to the home or workplace on request.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite is trying the big challenge, already being able to count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
In addition, the realities that offer a training, consultancy and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to business prospects.
Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, the spreadsheet intended to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows working on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl is also positive, his fourth case of doping.
Another positive moment in the last Tour de France: Gerolsteiner's Austrian team mate Bernhard Kohl, who finished third and won the best climber jersey.
This is the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe which reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth cyclist to score a Cera, the third generation Epo, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli from Italy, and Stefan Schumacher from Germany, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's test tubes are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the results of the tests confirm the positive result in the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to face two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positive third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus winning the pole-to-pole jersey of the best climber.
Immigrants:New York Times asks whether Italy is a racist country
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a favourite destination for immigrants" who are received with reluctance.
The New York Times has dedicated a long article to the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times calls the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are both the ones with "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature, which the Lega wants to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The trend was highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, in his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to overcome racism".
Students who are victims of high rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families of origin have to bear", explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani. "In these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun for the residents.
In most cases, the lease offers also contain a series of infringements: open-ended, unregistered contracts without rent limit, sub-leases.
According to Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the taxation review are necessary to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, it costs 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370-500 for a single bed.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), the average price for a single bed is 600 euros, for a double bed 450 euros.
Slightly lower rates (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/400 euros, for a single one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
For a bed, you'll need 250/350 euros, or 350 for a single.
In smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by students from outside the Community, a further anomaly is noted: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that charged to Italian students.
Goodbye old Paradiso cinema, the cities are enlightening the historical theaters.
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore is a good illustration of what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial towns,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the emergence of large multiplexes on the periphery and the death of single-screen cinemas in the city centres, is one of the major events that seems to us to be unavoidable and unquestionable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of the road and so many emotions" observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that gives Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prize of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of experiencing cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, say it all: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and theatres in the main cities have paid the most for this: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romagna is at the top with 82 lost single-screen cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that the multiplex is the main reason for their disappearance is that the three Italian regions have registered the most new multiplex cinemas: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian cinema industry has grown irrationally", observes Paolo Protti, president of ANAC, "and it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a cinema hall closes in a city, not all of its patrons are necessarily willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of credit for the merchants: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector, it would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
The first Italian city to be concerned about these closures was Bologna, which decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between the City Council and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-screen cinemas in historic centres and on the outskirts.
Among the measures envisaged are tax concessions for the managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking lots and certain car parks.
"This is an initiative that I like", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example and implement other measures.
It is clear, however, that to counter the super power of multiplexes, traditional theatres must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audiences are more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso Cinema" which I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, I turn the other way so I don't see the dust-blackened signs.
Links between politics and the ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
 The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall in the interests of the Piromalli clan".
The Calabria anti-mafia department has brought charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for conspiracy to provide services to the mafia.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted for mafia-type criminal association, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all to common sense", the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Maître Piromalli.
"Thus the clan would have been granted", the judges wrote, "official entry into the town halls, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration".
The president of the regional committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, when police announced they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged links between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, UDC mayor at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the ballot in May 2006.
He caused a scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, of having manipulated the whole thing for a political issue, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM write, there emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are going.
This is a vast deposit that covers over 70 percent of the surface of the planet and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have set their eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of harnessing energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970's, with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are giving a great boost to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity demand could be met by systems that exploit ocean waves.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there'd be the tides and currents.
Colossians on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in the north of Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it was a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more of these companies, which have always been devoted to traditional energy, are turning to marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is exploring opportunities to cooperate with us".
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially when you consider that in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavation
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are pursuing the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate, observers say, a growing interest.
Technology to be worked out.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, as marine energy does not allay fears about its environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not appear to pose a major problem to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use technologies with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The wave-like pressure that moves the mud up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn, powers a generator.
The power is sent to shore through undersea cables.
At the moment, we have four systems of this type in the design phase, one pending federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, in contrast, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking garage using six undersea turbines from the East River in New York City.
The movement of water on the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that powers a generator.
Verdant announced that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to pump energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, is the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, and others, are looking to the coast, investing $7.5 million in 2008 and planning investments up to $35 million in 2009.
