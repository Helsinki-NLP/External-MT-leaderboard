Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president
U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to win the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of more than $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he takes a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committees who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama receives the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when the prize is awarded.
The president does not want to escape this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
He further strengthened the war efforts a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which no one of his critics forgets to highlight.
During the ceremony, Obama also received the golden medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided about a concrete charitable work.
The event program will then include a banquet with the president and his wife, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the prime minister and another 250 charged guests will be present.
Obama was very restraintful to the price from the beginning.
For example, he indicated that he feels that he does not deserve the price completely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for everyone who seeks the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he admitted that it was for him a “invitation to action”.
Conservatives are accused of eradication
The Leitmeritz Police accused the Chairman of the Citizens' Association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of persecution.
In several cases, he made appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors to his benefit, said Leader's police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
Chairman of the Leader Meritz-Nature Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and it threatens him to a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting powder containers in Brünn do not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packages, in the southern Moroccan villages you can find back on the step and get the sorting powder containers.
And in Brunei?
There you need to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable waste tones.
I don’t want to claim that the waste separation in Brünn would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors do not take care of this problem enough, even if we are the second-largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here in the sorting containers can always only dissolve paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the center, for example, to dissolve the PET bottles in a collection box?
It is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place that I have found by chance so far is the Mährenplatz in front of the Gans affected.
Mr. Onderka should not annoy us his colleagues, but that happens to me too little.
In addition to the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey slice in other parts.
All of my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
from Faulness.
It is too far from the waste.
I am not surprised.
Even after the celebration I offered to dissolve a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street I have not seen any color waste tones in view.
Fortunately I got to the right place on the railroad.
The waste was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics is likely to leave the Brunei socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city a ice hockey league that makes us shame throughout the Republic instead of buying a few tons of waste more and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner brune.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brünn is really the worst in the entire district of Southmähren.
The Paroubek budget has removed the money for pensions and medical funds
After the left party, despite the government’s opinion, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no money in the budget for pensions, medical funds and construction savings.
But not for state debt interests or for international disputes.
This will cause them even more problems that will be on the government in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists implemented the salary increase for some groups, they anticipated that the government would pay the money for the sensitive spending, retirement or medical funds in addition. "This is just a delay of the problems to the future, mining," says Janota.
From the loans, increasingly higher interest rates are paid, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from where to take, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To the pensions or the sick money, from whose account 1.8 billion are gone, people don’t have to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year, so in the state cash not only will lack 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster, along with the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT only slightly or cut the maternity money, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the money laundering in favour of some electoral groups, there will also be a lack of five billion in the next year for the expansion of the highways and railways.
These are mostly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be projected and possibly booked.
At least what is not free.
This means delay or suspension of thirty large buildings, Europe’s funding is also in danger, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the flow of money solomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from them the money will then be dispersed into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never secure and it is in no way an infinite source.
Last year, the CEZ amounted to $18 billion in budget.
Each year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the new level by 5.7 percent of GDP, according to EU rules.
But this does not end the Carnival of Revolutions.
Nearly three billion shed the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for spending for judicial disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state will deal without that money is not sure.
It is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money within the country or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar project “Statskass”, which is intended to enable on-line monitoring what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project should be stopped and in this case there will be sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single button between different operating systems.
The proposed plans look promising.
It’s enough to just press one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly the possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which is primarily focused on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on the mobile.
You can switch between these, you can divide them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware said in an interview with the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will come to the market in 2012.
Virtualizing the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which parallelly the mentioned systems operated both Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full course.
Now, VMware is working with European and American operators on the virtualization of smartphones and the devices are expected to come to customers within 2012.
Snow in the mountains torment hotel owners
Scneelose pistes are not only for the residents of the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stay in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year’s Christmas party will be on snow or “on matsch”, said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants the New Year's stay in the spider milk exactly according to his intentions, should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer savings and where the quality of the stay only comes to the second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they will endeavour to sell them for a long time, but then they will also have to give up and enter in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter terminals are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last minute, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Day in Riesengebirge can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free places here.
Good deal is also found in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold in average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for the snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pistes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
On the contrary, and a little better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about 5 percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also work well, said the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the New Year’s Eve stay, the Omnia Hotel is also occupied at the central parking area in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, for Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
This year, we were delightfully surprised by the January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will increase, said Omnia Hotel Director Erik Sporysch.
The hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow protection.
It should be cold on Thursday, and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then a warming will come again, Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove said.
United States: Repeat is Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost funny, with which student aspiration Barack Obama, the president, with his call of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he eventually scratched his desirably anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he scratched it over the copy paper from the Bush-Irak scenario for three years.
Not only does he use the speech "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own Declaration: "New Road forward" without losing.
Three years ago, he also criticized Bush’s idea – to send fresh military contingents to Iraq planned by the Civil War – as “unresponsible and in its consequences catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of the military, was the only possible and so successful that it was no longer spoken in the news about Iraq today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this because he objectively left a much more grateful outcome situation to his successor than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to increase the contingent of troops, he was again asked by the military, especially the Supreme Commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even, despite the subordination habits, hardly criticized the murdering defenders in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to make the situation better.
The president was delayed three months, but he did not come to a better idea and so he deceived the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself initially expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic in the whole Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan within 18 months, and to complete this process within three years.
Some doubt that the halved rise will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the Brother War in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The situation in Afghanistan is characterized by the counterindications – no one can rely on anyone and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if formally correctly established, will remain only brilliant buildings behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
Interest balance between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially due to the uncertainty of the relations that make the influences of Pakistan and Iran even more complicated.
Even the construction of a “actionable state,” which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy blocked by its volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry about the “Friday Return” can make a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul can not be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is going to be tended.
European politicians cannot and will not explain to their voters the way the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that could have a radical impact on the situation is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not affect the Iranians, it is a very serious question for the United States whether it is not to solve the problem with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which the United States goes to Obama to the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turning of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only trick for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and so there is enough time for him to take a different strategy if it would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the Goldman Sachs Bank no longer receive prize bonuses in cash
The chief executive of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive prize bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to connect the Wall Street premiums with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction it has to go, said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism after it had deposited $17 billion in prize bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total increase in the premiums over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion even despite the action presented today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hotest political topic in a number of countries with the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bonuses of the banks, which exceed £25,000, unilaterally with a 50% tax.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women won this year’s Nobel Prize in the fields and literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her husband Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The Prize for Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli woman Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the enlightenment of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her landman Oliver Williamson received for the analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This award has been awarded today by scientists Charles Kao for the research in the glass fiber area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the foundation of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these prize winners has received the Diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Money Prize.
It is worth 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price is divided between them.
Traditionally, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and beyond standing at the forefront of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
But in keeping with his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation.Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives Friday morning the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the execution of the state budget for the next year in the form it was released by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the public financial crisis.
The meeting was by the spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On Monday, Janota will negotiate his remaining office with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which is now signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the Parliament agreed on the left-wing proposals on money shifting and increasing the money for government officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and the direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it hidden to increase the budget deficit.
Therefore, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party on the other hand, and therefore the questioning of the further work of the Fishermen-Official Cabinet, on the design of which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by the Parliament, practically liquidates the package of savings implemented by the Fisherman government in the autumn, and that, according to their understanding, is intended to end the state debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the bill on the state budget, said today at the debate with entrepreneurs that the politicians have long neglected the "serious problem", which represents the "unbearable deficit" of public finances.
He believes there is no good solution anymore.
A improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
ODS Deputy Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as "strong statements" in the editorial.
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek's words that the state deficit was horrible that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Mandela played in Morgan Freeman's new film by Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Untold" shows the world a lot of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The untouchable fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the nineteenth-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said to him, “If I’m going to play you, I’ll have to meet you.
The twenty-six-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", has already represented the leader of the abolition movement, from which he has finally become a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan All-Powerful", but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African citizen was in jail for 27 years for his active activity in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became the president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The demand was how he spoke.
The film depicts a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to negotiate the country.
He believes that he can agree with his people through the sport, so he decides to agree with the rugby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team runs up until the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela’s story to the cinema.
He had no other objective than to play this role in such a way as to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela the hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transmitted, and I felt I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have overcome.
The actor said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I ringed the door clock that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the movie I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual patterns, he has received positive reviews under the leadership of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Untold" and one is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well performed film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians tested a missile
Over Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin to be observed.
The Russian Defense Ministry has not yet announced that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful and the missile called the type "Bulava", which originally should be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on the site at the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as about "a missile that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn’t fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
At the end of the flight there were technical damage to the missile.
Probably the engine exploded in the third-level missile.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was driving under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the deployment from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unlimited flying object over the northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Norwegians have no doubt since the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generality has kept itself against it this time and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not disappear and only the third stages were affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even though no test start was made without mistakes, the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense only consider six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The fifty-percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and so it is continued to be claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hyperscall nuclear blow heads with a total weight of max. 1,15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov is presenting himself again in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup owner will help his team CSKA Moscow in the emergency, and is likely to play in the Friday KHL duel against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently CSKA’s president.
After Denis Kuljas has been injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it’s not clear if the famous ice hockey player’s return will only affect a game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other co-player, co-player Nemcinov led up.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary Stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of one hundred and fifty, and was able to score 15 goals and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, and he also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup over his head twice in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai has dismissed the trade unions, all overheads are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to cancel all overheads.
Due to frequently scheduled overhours, the trade union announced the preparation for strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s automotive factory spokesman Petr Vanek.
The Board of Directors will negotiate with the trade unions on a Saturday meeting this week.
We should not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, volunteer overhours were proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on the Saturday layer.
The staff will also receive it in the subsequent week for Saturday 28th November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Or they will be allowed to pay the extra hour fee or they will be able to take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer will be paid the ticket and lunch.
Given that the overhours were the most urgent and burning point with regard to the claims and complaints of the trade unions who stopped production last week, the board of directors decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overhours for the month of December.
The car factory staff had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour layer for 2 more hours until last week.
From the signing of the agreement, the strike preparation will be revoked by the trade unions.
More negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike preparation.
The situation in the automotive factory has sharpened last week, Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontanely strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged scams.
The management opposed that employees had to do the overtime to meet the car sales needs.
The trade unions also demanded in their Monday strike preparation call that the employees who stopped production last Wednesday will not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, trade unions call on to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they demand to pay the salary of 5,000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Hyundai car factory now employs 2,000 people.
The series production began in the company in November last year.
By September this year, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current manufacturing capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ‘proved’ HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds to stop the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the connection to common viral variants does not work as strong as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS disease cannot be cured.
However, the patient’s combination of medications can extend life and prevent the reproduction of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a whole number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the viral proliferation has also resulted in the development of resistant viruses, against which no drugs are more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological College) Prague as well as from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metal-carborans act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metal carborans are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and kobalt.
These compounds block the viral proliferation in other ways than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new ‘upgrade’ compounds, which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their bond to the viral protein.
The metal carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-shaped boxes consisting of bor, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case kobalt.
Permanent and domestic virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-virus division caused by HIV protease, no mature infectious viral particles would be created.
If we disable HIV protease, we also disable the reproduction of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work, which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a whole series of compounds in which two pairs of the cabbage (see table) are linked through a short organic chain, which then is systematically further modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reaction glass, also against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with clinically used medications, however, it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the used medications are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metal carborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute for budget. ODS went on Fischer, who defends
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year "great" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS called the Prime Minister "strong statements".
It is supposed to have time for the analysis.
Deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he intends to stay in office using the parliamentary links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficits is diametrally different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Parliament approved the budget for 2010, but with leftist proposals of amendments of more than 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has increased the funds for government employees, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it hidden to increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a salary of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the government's desire, because the changed budget is just a less bad variant of the budget provisory.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, against which Prime Minister Jan Fischer led that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation for the case that the amendment proposals would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota has signed up to the Prime Minister on Monday after the government's business.
He said he would consider his remaining office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the negotiations of the budget.
As far as Fischer is speaking for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Social Democracy (CSSD) candidates who had implemented the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will withdraw if the Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning health care and pensions or the service law novel.
Topolanek: The ODS-nominated ministers are not wrong
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in the post of deputy people who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to give up the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is completely logical and correct that he rely on the left majority that is currently in parliament."
He said he could not expect the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I didn’t think about it, and if it’s up to date, then I’m going to deal with it, the defense minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens, told reporters in the parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
The ODS returned at the request of the premiere
Necas also emphasized that the ODS would likely vote in parliament on Wednesday against the amended budget if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the citizens’ Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not withdrawn in the political talks on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament as well as in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would go all positive, especially about the bolchevization of the parliament and the destruction of it, said Topolanek himself.
According to the new route plan of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for approximately the same price.
The Czech Railway terminates or restricts from December 13 some faster and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2 percent from the date of validity of the new road plan compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer travel rates are not changed.
Several connections to the capital are available, for example, to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The speed train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer speed trains will also run on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route, basically the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight per cent, with an increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tabor-Budweis route are also canceled and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route is reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to move to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko pre-local transport system, which can be opened thanks to the rail electrifying from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Railway Station.
The CD will enter more connectivity lines between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run in a two-hour distance.
Pendolino has not allowed passengers to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year’s regional rail bill: a 200 million increase
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the total railway to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year will receive four billion crowns,just as this year.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local and fast trains, the rail has a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railroad praises the system, that’s why it has not hit the price increase at the vast majority of the trains.
Changes will only occur on single-day CD Net and on cheap eLiska Internet Drive.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the steak that was driven, until now it was unified for the journey between any districts and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militias arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This was by the agency AFP, which originally only over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militians allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining prisoners.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the Neuvolks Army (NPA), this is the weapons group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police prosecuted the kidnappers for the violence that the two local family clans demanded.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law was imposed due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which led to the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, the United Nations began peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes into the American cinemas "Invictus: The Untouched", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supernatural role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the film’s start, the reactions of critics and the public will also be sound.
by Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sachar Prize, and in 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinema in a time in which in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the world championship culminate, but at the same time the media shock the world public with scary news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are still positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he spoke in an interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can get this movie to the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book model by British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the Role of the Enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential election period.
During the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial and each other-limited populations for years and days, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African National Rugby in the World Cup, which South Africa then won.
For the entrance of the race into the dress, which in South Africa is almost considered a sacred act, Mandela raised large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience, and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship accomplishes it by bringing people together into a single people, led the rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" in the national team.
Whether the tension situation in South Africa is improving, that will first be revealed.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in a recent interview with LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK, told.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformator of the company Ceps in the switch facility near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman for the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to let the transformators burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water-sham and special liqueurs.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformator internal currency.
No one was injured, the accident threatened, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the control system was not.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more accurately, the damage will be indicated only after the fire.
The destroyed transformator must be replaced by a new, according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened with the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for Nordböhmen, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the tram station did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a single operator of the conductive system, the electrical connections of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins, renovates and develops 39 switching plants with 67 transformators, which transfer the electricity to the distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura is sentenced to criminal offence for misconduct against three leaders of the CSSD.
The student agency owner, Radim Jancura, has been sentenced to trial against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Southmähren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio newspaper.
The complaint is associated with the company’s efforts to operate regional trains in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term agreements with the Czech Railway.
All three guides touch us and say that we take out the roses, while we have submitted the offer only on the scope it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Rail because we would know the prices of the Czech Rail that were completed last week.
So there is nothing else left for us than to defend us.
Because of this misleading of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
This is why we are preparing a lawsuit against the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of the punishment for the further continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call for more guides.
I think it will also be clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura last week that it has invested several million crowns in advertising that will indicate the districts’ negative step.
He told the radio newspaper that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and will continue it after the New Year.
He specified that he would lead the anti-corruption campaign as such.
The campaign was launched in Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railway with the Czech Railway and had not issued any tender for the order at a height of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behavior is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by a CSSD member.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could also lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, his name I don't say, Jancura told the radio newspaper today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is free and voluntary
Injection against pneumococcus changes the usual from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But now voices report that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcus culminate.
The medical institution already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
The new vaccination
Vaccination for August Children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus that were born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that you have not yet received a vaccine.
Those who have started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further recovery vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between the child’s 3rd and 5th months of life.
Last year, a quarter of families vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for the vaccine doses.
But they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccines for children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcus infections, up to 28 children aged up to 10 years of age die every year.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the obligatory vaccination of children against pneumococcus has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
It is expected to be paid by the insurance agencies and voluntary from January.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, named for example the head of the civil union of Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association has long-term been dedicated to pneumococcus vaccination.
The professionals at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very pleased with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to at least keep that.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine procedure against pneumococcus.
At this point we don’t consider it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The chairman of the professional society of practical pediatrists, Hana Cabrnochova, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeated vaccines “In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was initiated as a volunteer,” says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to get their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccine against pneumococcus is also important in the fact that the first surface vaccine is paid by the health insurance and not by the state.
Insurers should spend the money on prevention so they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of the practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance and the doctors then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
Some members, however, feared that the insurance companies could “take the money out of the health insurance.”
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will need to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant amount.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. Artist's Son Participated in "Museum Thief"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured when he invited 90 paintings into his vehicle with followers.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a bagger to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his performance of characters such as Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family shock.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Junior claimed he was ordered by his father "that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a warehouse."
The agency that Frank Frazetta Senior complained to have given any permission.
Labour Defends State and Tax Increases
The ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the presidential report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have given a chance to show that he was seriously thinking about reducing the deficit by taking the decisions up until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor was also striking for targeting low and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social insurance and a 1 percent drop in public wages for 2011.
Social insurance concerns
The trade unions, on the contrary, have protested that low-loan recipients are punished for a recession they have not caused and warned of upcoming "problems".
The rise of social insurance – to approximately £3 billion a year – has annoyed the private economy, which says it is an employment tax, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
Principles of the pre-government
Social insurance increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy decreased by more than expected 4.75%
50% tax on bank bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for small
Tax disadvantages for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State pensions increased by 2.5%
According to the Treasury’s estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year, and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190, while someone with £10,000 per year income will be richer by £110.
The ministers said their target of deficit announcement by 2013 would mean "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the charges of the additional taxes would fall to the 5% of top earnings.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
“These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit announcement and this is necessarily necessary over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour party’s forecasts on the future economic growth – which will affect the extent of the new debt and the speed of deficit settlement – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to review previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to decline by 4.75 percent this year – much more than the 3.5 percent decline expected in April – while the debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than previously predicted.
“Lost Opportunity”
The conservatives, who intend to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s debt crisis, said the planned debt of £789 billion would be unbearable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will repay it and “cynically” press themselves before difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
“They’ve said nothing about what they’re going to do,” Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond said, “They’ve had their opportunity to do this, and they’ve let them pass.”
“The significant announcement will be made only after the election, no matter who wins it.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the conservative proposals that see deficit cuts come faster and faster.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops will be used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that a lot at the time of the announcement - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disabled pensions in April next - would put the Treasury Chancellor off the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
“High State”
Although the ministers have not announced any state details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public expenditure will not be tolerated until in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigation said the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong discrepancies in many areas, possibly in the future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defense.
“It only moves the pain to later,” said his director Robert Chote.
“The significant announcement will be made only after the election, no matter who wins it,” added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at Deloitte.
"This was just the hole pre-state report. the markets recognize it."
FBI investigates "arrestation of U.S. citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five U.S. citizens for suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Pandchab, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is being investigated whether the same men were missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are of Pakistani origin, one of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“When they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the accusations they are accused and under what circumstances they are arrested,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authorities were informed about the arrest and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges were filed against the men arrested.
The news agency Reuters that it refused Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must “work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were missing at the end of November by their families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report detailed the "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the alleged presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was shot and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the alleged election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Criminal Office.
But since then there has been no more tolerance from the authorities to criticism, our correspondent said.
“False Confession”
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer scientist Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
“They hit me in the face more often,” he was quoted.
“I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me.”
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
The striking presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some of the protesters who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the accusations of rape, but admitted that abuses have occurred.
Amnesty also named the case of a former prisoner who said he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a criminal facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government’s reactions to it, but according to Amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested over the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to transform a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The skiing point of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the hang in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jumping point at the beginning of a 100 meters long hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hang, but it was also very beautifully scary.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboards in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best works of art performed on the hang - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to the mixture.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and well-thoughted report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't like headscarves" (2006), an elegant and deeply argumenting study of a controversial question that shared and engaged the country over another and a half decades and the effects of which are still to be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and coherent spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the area.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions now offering 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free spaces".
He is a good listener, he brings discussions between teachers and students about the questions that most worry them.
Should a Muslim be married (or both) in a mosque or council?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It’s these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up everyday life, completely contrary to the political dramas that the media occupy.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, no one of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interrogated Bowen are mostly disagreed with their Salafi objects – supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, which is connected with Saudi Arabia – presently showing a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a giving and taking on both sides.
He questiones how far French political decision makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate to guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a greater treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on their part, had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes rather a “aggravation of values” than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, you tend to say “Yes, but not yet.”
The most frustrating view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them smells with an alarming speed and takes life with it, which can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their kiel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the ice bear.
Moving into the complicated history and politics of the wolf, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in the hunting of the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a ice bear as a courageous 14-year-old frog to the lake, who only fought with the arms of his muscles, is a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were captured when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus show in the early 20th century showed 75 ice bears at a show.
Even today, zoo plants still typically possess one million pieces of the living area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore has become very green by the alges that grow in the holy hair of its pear.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunting for the species' survival.
Although it is forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, the landing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting in helicopters and motorcycles use powerful storm weapons to bring their beats to the track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting seas.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and worrying description of the science of the Arctic and a comprehensive insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneering journey of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time led to the confusion of the package.
Submarines measure the moving degrees during the Cold War.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measurement sonds on ice mountains, but still a lot is achieved by untouched people fighting outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, small world of the infusion system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by salt water resins that are pressed together when freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopically small miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer rain passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, we could be that.”
Marine infanterians were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kränze
De'Angello Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to put a single crancy on the grave of a soldier he had never hit.
For him and the other marine infanterists who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate tombs, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have gone.
In a few months, wherever we are taken back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were that, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs on the cemetery in Arlington.
It’s now a 18 year old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this trip every year, keep in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the tombs at the Arlington Court, in areas on the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Court in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and on the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial Place in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of the crops.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something the victims brought.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in lounges of warm clothes, the volunteers walked around the extended grass areas and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were targeted by older tombs from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the newest tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was pleasant, children played, and couples stood on their hand while carrying the fresh covers to the grey tomb stones.
Each round crancy was dark green with a small red slide that was fixed on the top.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark mood of current wars fulfilled this area.
Some cry openly, others pray, and families and friends stayed together in the ice air.
Some read the names placed in stone, while others turned down to small black-white plaque cards that were placed in the moist slam for those whose grave stones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who laid bitter tears before her son's grave.
She has been driving 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the cemetery of Marine Infrantery subofficer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son has paid for it, she said.
“If I’m not there for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
US government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the U.S. government, who sold mobile phones and laptops in the country, the Foreign Ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, is working for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as USAID, the U.S. Authority for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. Interest Representative in Havana are trying to get access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special accusations have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, accusing of the "danger".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Government-fighting graffiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are traced and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to boost tensions between the Castro Brother’s Communist government in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will make a compensation if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 a month.
The Cuban government only permits ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of a American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind gitters for crimes such as drugs, said Gloria Berbena, the U.S. Interest Representative spokeswoman in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest.
Arrestation and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
A activity that would be legal in any other free society - the provision of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a hard report on liberty in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a reference to the appointment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused would be very often arrested, condemned and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time the two countries move for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist counterparts who search the internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for an unprecedented rebellion, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video page.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of the Pakistani tribal district, which is the home of Al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a spokesman for the Pakistani intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah couldn’t convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA disruption to immigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the irreversible mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a hidden operation.
That’s why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were no way distracted and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani punishment authorities.
The case of the five men – who are still in Pakistan and are investigated by the FBI – highlights the crucial role of the candidates in identifying future terrorists and even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence agency has made it a matter of high urgency to accommodate human assets within Al-Qaeda.
The candidates of the organization act as pforts who don’t let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American volunteer recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the U.S., said terrorist groups have become much more cautious over the past few years in terms of who they have allowed access because the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way you could go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the internet.
Thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded the dealers in the city’s Bella Congress Center to take more action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more than about 25,000.
The event went relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when the UN-sponsored climate negotiations did not happen much, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparents, on which in English standed "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "too".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travel to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, makes her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to fight due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to participate in the big demonstration - to continue the word and call on the world leaders to make a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there’s no way to get around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned as he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes burned several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the building, he said, adding that they started as light tracks, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Congress Center, the people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate dealers.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive impact on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued to Mandarin and said, “Because the event is large, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they interfere with negotiations or the freedom of others.”
Examination data show persistent racial flux
The certificates for mathematical performance were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the highest-performance schools in the country, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth-class leaders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average score of the white four-classers from Washington D.C. increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (at a scale of 500), but their African-American equals increased only by three points from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African American eight-classers remained basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average white student score was not included in the exam data because the exam scope was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not even more encouraging.
The gap that separated the white and black four-classers in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that the children of both groups have reached has grown over this time period, the difference has hardly decreased with now 58 points.
Some district educational advocates expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by Schulkan clerk Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were promoted by most white students, who are yet powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the Board of Directors of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group supporting educational equality in Washington D.C.
I'm not jumping up and down for a two or three-point spin, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam points is that the city’s secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what worries me is that we don’t almost waste the time and energy we should spend for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, which is aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic reading skills have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their equal classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that takes the forefront from kindergarten to sixth class games and life-looking experiences, was brought to Washington under the former chief school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress last week.
I mean we have to continue to work to make the best measures to benefit students who are below the notary level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results raise the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the weak performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examines urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to target its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The aim could have political consequences that work against this important agenda point.
The weakness is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
One must raise the school year to approximately 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days a year with his teaching union last year, which he sees as "a milepower" on the way to a greater rise in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs out and blinds for a moment when she sees the white piles, the rocks and the smaragd green grass.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-class group that explored Gettysburg, where the lesson costs $38,690 a year, was rather that of an ambitious visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
“Yes, I’m going to be here soon!” called Graciela, who wanted to study medicine when the leader announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really?” she said thoughtfully when she was the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is an increasing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who get the college education that is needed to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” of Hispanic Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workers.
Those who investigate powerful children say these often have a natural affinity for the school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who put their children high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a great role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them in searching through the system, then a single measure will at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Spanish-American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - A Gang High - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to bring bigger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renewal of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been shaken for decades by war and economic sanctions.
U.S. companies could only register shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven U.S. companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has issued an order has pulled the shorter.
Two U.S. companies were able to conclude contracts for the fields sold in June.
The thin-sized representatives of the American oil mass at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, Iraq has finally opened its doors and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European companies put the way forward, said Ruba Husari, the editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns, which were still highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, likely have stopped U.S. oil companies, analysts said to engage more in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest proven raw oil reserves.
U.S. companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower salary costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to pay accounts to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies that could conclude contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on the side of technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main stakeholders in two of the contracts signed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the oil ministry spokesman, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy as well as a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its co-providers and will fulfill its obligations toward Iraq.
For the provision, selected companies issued orders, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al-Qaeda planners killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top al-Qaeda operation planner is expected to have been killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
This would be, if it was confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior responsible of the terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were alleged to have been killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of northern Kazakhstan.
Local authorities that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in the illegal tribal district of Pakistan.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a spokesman for a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants fled to the place and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. anti-terrorism agency presented unlimited evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of the Al-Qaeda, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, noted a senior officer who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the subtle character of the U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Considering its central role as given, this also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al-Qaeda’s top leaders and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia has rapidly risen into the al-Qaeda hierarchy andins best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not reduce the danger he constituted for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who has been killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website spoken by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, who have taken steps to reduce their aggressiveness and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the site.
UN Ambassador to Kabul Resigns
U.N. chief ambassador to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, which would end a stormy term, stumbled by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eid's withdrawal took place when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN messenger said he supported the raise of troops, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is scheduled to start in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghan that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil assistants to help the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said he would not set up his office, but only fulfil an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now moving forward so that he has time to take care of a replacement.
What I said is that he’s better starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say he considered the Swedish-Italian Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led the UN peace operations.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and hiding evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "has undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a large degree of skepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures of the U.S.-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other western countries to donate for the Afghan mission, and said this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be properly used.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said the complicated UN settlement has undermined his possibilities of bringing people able.
The UN rules are designed so that I have been able to hire only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and should not continue so.
U.S. Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day trip through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the probability of such a development.
“One of the things that lies on my soul is if in the last six years we’ve learned something from Iraq that gives war its own unpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a “pack of positive and negative incentives” is needed to “convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “her people will suffer more” under the sanctions.
In a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the U.S. government admitted to European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "believable" consequences if its nuclear program does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be acquired for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed on this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time — partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is unconfident about whether it should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community standing in relation to some of the proposals they had already agreed at the beginning of October, openly said, has gathered the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions against Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to pursue other options, including those that Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “pressing sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington on Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public income.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. military strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, “We will your security, your wealth and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Rate change in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda plaquets, which kept lectures to them that "Mother Earth is too tired to talk to more children" and "A baby more means a tomb more."
These lessons they learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the aging population, suddenly began this summer to change the course and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing remains, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with a 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, disguised single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis is triggering in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force.
The Department of Population Affairs estimates that the number of people aged 60 and older will rise from 16.7 per cent by 2020 to 31.1 per cent explosively by 2050.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people had 22 percent of the inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, the head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in fertile age need to get babies to “help them to reduce the proportion of aging population and to alleviate the workforce shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - as the industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Based on the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Married couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines — up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions — and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed to this policy that the critical claim of national natural resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned misuse in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to give up.
Many couples were also allowed to perform gender-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they accepted more exceptions to the rule—including urban residents, ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children—and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was shrinked.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children with a partner a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were almost overnight replaced by guidelines that detailed who comes into question for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent urban staff and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and pull information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that there is a rise in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the city districts don’t report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are submitted per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- a little higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Caolu Municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this was legally permitted.
But they own, as many Chinese, only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West erroneously assess one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, we’re stolen the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not just in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she just wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone cared about us.
We are not accustomed to taking care of others and do not really want it.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old man belonging to a translation company, said it unblind.
For parents from the middle age with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns to be successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up by seeing their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses enormous demands to the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume for the best pre-schools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of life, he said.
We don’t want to bring too many victims.
United Nations Group Plans Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been distinguished by wild poses and mutual accusations, on Friday again highlighted with the publication of a document that marks a ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations to bear the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final policy agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has both denied the remaining obstacles and showed the way forward.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that comes out as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specific UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that wealthy countries should give to the poor countries in order to manage the global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise would be contributed by policy makers.
The process will be given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the leading UN climate representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big whole.”
It shows the groundbreaking of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 border values, while bigger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also pushed on Friday’s talks through its commitment to allocate $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change – from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
The Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had determined last week.
The U.S. Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger developing countries, if they are not funded by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is running a harder line with China than the representative of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreement without the rise of larger emerging countries and taking action, according to the star, who also complained that the text is not going far enough, to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outside countries.
Star gave his opinion an hour after the statement of Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading U.S. climate dealers either lacked "the reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" from him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
As the future economic direction of the great world powers is on the ground, breaks have emerged both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle refers equally to the rescue of individual economies as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States standing for their respective commitments, while poorest countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the great powers are struggling for who should bear the costs for the freezing of greenhouse gas emissions, as even the affected countries have moved to act more aggressively to take the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes to the responsibility for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic domination will develop, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to struggle for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of Small Islands States with 43 members submitted a 24-sided draft agreement early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exercits political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demands action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions need to be clarified before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Ministry, rise their aircraft and walk through the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to remove claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The purely scale of the assembly—13,000 people go and go out in the congress center every day, guitar actors host night shows in which they make fun about the countries that they think are betrayed and sold, and contracts are hand in hand rather than by email—is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train defines Monday's feeling
On Monday morning at 5:13 a pipe will penetrate the dark to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras, and 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then go to Mrs. Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of faster and reliable trains and connect the large distribution areas of the Midlands, the north and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant pedestrian cities, working time would be radically reduced, and the shift from aircraft and car to train would reduce the national carbon emissions and the stains on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still pull the brake in the British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January and intended to submit a conducibility study to the government, will, according to the Times, submit the report on December 30.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed ski network.
The new train line, which is intended to connect London with the West Midlands, will pass with a range of five meters to urban areas and places where the environmental impacts are controversial.
In the open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed shipping network.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided in or near Birmingham, and a gap would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best functioning option,” said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first part route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to take the London-Birmingham route back in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The designs bans the train to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people could travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operating per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal station in London would be needed to get 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railways experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed trains to existing railways in northern Birmingham, making the travel time between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial breakthrough to ensure a shift from aircraft to train, a direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come for mortgage for £75,000 orange of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading subsidiary member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange that he read to build in his residence in his electoral circle.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that sub-home members must live "from weak races", has raised his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak wood plant at his two-house in Rutland.
He allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The house officials approved the applications at that time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the spending of the subsidiary members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could "not be even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest subsidiaries, owns a two-storey house in a village in its electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearly houses have achieved a purchase price of a million pounds (1,1 million euros).
The floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, a spending checkpoint of the home, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he grew a winter garden, which in the plans is called "Orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "Glasshouse for Entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to make a statement on increased fundraising during a recent investigation of its previous mortgage contracts.
The committee released him last month after an investigation of his spending from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the assurance for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that by March last year, Duncan received around 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 (€2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, indicating that the total increase served to fund the funding of £75,000 (85,000 euros).
The normal stagesless RBS hypothesis rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the under house show that Duncan continued to claim its right to £1250 (1400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as the opposition leader of the Household in September after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the output scandal that Parliament members would "live from poor races".
“In essence, when you work for the state, it means that you have to live from weak rations and how S*****e is treated.”
He said, “I’ve spent my money on my garden and I claim a scarcely small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole sum, but I don’t do it.”
The parliamentary member, a millionaire from his previous career as a oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, as it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could "be seen as an exaggerated claim."
As a protest, an activist grabbed a hole in the form of a pound mark in Duncan's grass after it became known that he had demanded £4,000 (€4,500) over three years.
When asked about the elevated mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and later by Legg for value increase."
He added: “There is no debate about escapes and interference or a breakdown of the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's Beach Hut Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their houses for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest house every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free glow wine and traditional Mince Pies, bakery pieces filled with dry fruits.
The so far selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Christmas", where the huth decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer spiritualist of the Chichester Diocese and the head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society again.
Why do we expect as a church from the people to come into a strange old building?I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to express it through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for the climate.
Thousands of people on Saturday demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen to call for an ambitious and binding deal on the fight against climate warming, where police have made several hundred arrestations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion until Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, the growing global climate mobilization contributes to what these demonstrations illustrate that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, broke the window with platter stones and hempers, a journalist told AFP.
Anti-Unrest police have intervened immediately and without consideration.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their estimates mainly members of the Black Blocks, these extremely violent split groups that have become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction" and has emphasized that about one hundred of them "always were arrested on the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme cold with gloves and inposition.
The more peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers for a evening with candle light, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived with buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with heavenly blue rains, have made a first rise in the morning in Copenhagen as you have followed the call of the Earth’s friends to form ‘blue times’ for the ‘climate justice’.
Today we go on the streets to demand a reimbursement of the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t continue so and tell ourselves that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dried out, water flow where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached the environmental organizations.
EU member José Bové, a figure of globalization critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link “climate justice and social justice”: “Today there is no difference between fighting climate warming and fighting for a different world.”
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are endangered by the warming, has given the starting point for the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have gone on the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and had bandanas in which you had the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators held demonstrations to demand an energic approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, and Georgia denounces that it is a "strike" here.
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control over the South Ossetic area, another Georgian secesionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The elections were closed at 17:00 GMT.
The voting participation was approximately 58 percent a few hours before the election, according to the Abkhazi election committee officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President Mikhail Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under a secure total occupation, his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, unlawfully occupied by Russia.
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia wants to prove through this election that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in an election hall located in a school in the capital Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Big signs on which Bagapch is visible on the side of the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm-hearted welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, who has picked up a glass of vodka.
The opposition on its side, represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia Russia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no one of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demo Worldwide, Intervals in Copenhagen
Thousands of people on Saturday demonstrated around the world to demand an ambitious and binding deal from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for use, arrested about 700 people on the edge of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the centre and did not try to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for a evening with candle light, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters, dressed in black and armed with backs and remnants, began to shoot discs, a journalist told AFP.
Anti-unrest police have immediately crossed you and have ingested without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the Black Blocks, these extremely violent split groups that have become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer during the interruptions, in which, according to the police, approximately twenty people were temporarily arrested, suffered a wound by a pillar stone.
“We have the extreme groups in control,” said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces circulated in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue rainmantel, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the “Friends of the Earth” called for a first group to represent the “Blue Seas” for “climate justice.”
“Today we’re going on the street to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the South,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say to ourselves, we still have time,” says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa there are rivers that flow, there are water streams through which you can walk, which never happened before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the opponents of globalization has approached the environmental protection organizations.
The French Parliament and globalization critic, José Bové, told AFP that he has arrived in Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice."
Oxfam has mobilized several individuals, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are susceptible to Earth's warming, has given the incentive for the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, the majority of whom students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertisements before the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters gathered in a campaign against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered together during the “Net of the 350” organized demonstrations, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects Geography and History arise, according to Chatel, strongly from the school reform of the Lycéen.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel said in an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects geography and history strongly arise from the school reform of the lyces, even if they are not mandatory taught in the terminal (12th school year).
“The students of the Première (11. school year) now have every four hours a week and the same program,” Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this gloriousness must be overcome," because, according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, in general, a concentration "the best student."
“The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) should not become the subprofile of the scientific,” he continued. he emphasized: “I have not even heard many historians and intellectuals who would have worried about the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals on technical lyces.”
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité found that seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the state project of removing the compulsory teaching in history and geography at Terminal S (12. school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals regretted this project as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The minister replied that there would be no question regarding a limitation of the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they think is a victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister concluded that they undergo a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year of an admission examination in which their teaching skills will be examined.
In addition, they conduct internship during the year at M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the exercises offered before the performance test, you will even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - "a thing that does not exist in people's education."
He once again confirmed that he wants to cancel the school card "up to 2012".
15 minutes for climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fiveteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d’Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the public for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and awaken the feeling of wanting to learn more in them, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave the fish in the pool of the school.
"According to the experts, about twenty discussions were selected, including according to their charisma," he said.
“On climate warming you can talk for hours, but the core targets can also be set in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely about 50 people with the help of folies.
“This is part of our role as a scientist,” he emphasized in the hope that the listeners will find out that “the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier.”
The videos drawn by these conferences will be available online on the school’s page from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Payment Delay: Terrible Prisoners, Action Planned
The syndicates of prosecutors called for a general action day on Friday to ensure that the awards and overheads, whose payments have been postponed for budget reasons until January, are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second syndicate of punishment officials (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning before the punishment agency in order to pay attention to the “theft of what they deserve”.
The 3rd syndicate of punishment officials (CGT-Pénitentiaire) called for “to unite for a strong mobilization in the various prisons” on which the non-payment of the overhours, night shocks and Sunday and holidays in December will be burned as “hurtful and unacceptable”.
The first syndicate of prosecutors, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institutions Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for “general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger.”
The headquarters of the law enforcement agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that the excess hours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all were provided in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced tonight, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the syndicates of prosecutors in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made in the next month.
“I know very well about the staff’s efforts to keep and modernize our punishment system functional,” the Minister of Justice said in a letter.
“I have ordered the execution department to take immediate measures so that such a situation arising from the lack of assessment of the overhour is not repeated in the future,” Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage thus falls low, except for the management staff, who enjoys high service and target awards, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "health duties" must be held.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseille announces to boycott “all meetings and calls” up to new instructions.
“The staff doesn’t go to work on Sundays and holidays if then the hours from October to December are still unpaid.
“In a time when more and more tasks are brought to us without more staff being employed, the attempt to enrich the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate,” the CGT trade union of Bordeaux said.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
But in any case it is wrong, said UFAP Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
Obama is the opinion that he distributes better Christmas gifts than he receives himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has praised on TV Talk Master Oprah Winfrey that he is distributing better gifts than he receives himself.
In a special show broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, President and his wife Michelle gave an insight on how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-foot companion of the family, will be with the game.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year," she tells the president.
“So please,” he shelmisched and pointed to the first lady’s pear chain, “And who gave you this?”
During this one-hour broadcast in an untouched atmosphere with the well-known television moderator, which Barack Obama so strongly supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about the gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama reminded him of a 10-way bicycle and also of a basketball that his father, who he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball,” he said.
"Only much later in my life I realized that I had that ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of gathering them around the fireplace.
Johnny Hallyday is operated again, RTL confirms that he was transmitted into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to substantial "salary" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had detected "an injury resulting from a band accident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these injury would have made a re-operation necessary.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to clarify that the situation is "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be present within 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid " pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, a little more certainty was made about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the manufacturing company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" it shows that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was placed.
The Rocker was operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a band dish accident.
The procedure planned for several days was performed by the neurochirurg Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After the operation by Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on Monday due to a consequential infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is just going through a "deep valley" but he assured that "there is no need to worry" about making the rock musician a "good fighter".
"He had called me before his flight to Los Angeles.I told him that it's bad to sit in a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, that's not so," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacted well to the antibiotics” and that “the infection was suppressed.”
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he didn't feel any particular concern.
However, the worries about the singer’s health were increasing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had fallen on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP," which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer planned his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem is widely commented. fans and journalists have not missed that the singer on stage had difficulty moving.
Only in the middle of November, the people around him had to denounce a re-enterment to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short Railway: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, on the Euro-2009 on the shortway in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane ships were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m plains and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m plains.
Sad for Bousquet, who wanted to hit the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freistil, the 28-year-old French claimed himself in 20.53 seconds. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually they are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet attacked the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in greater and greater and in this case I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane trains that are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The combination has not been paid for the German Paul Biedermann, the second world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and the world record.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) yet he spent his second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russians Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task.”
“Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future,” Biedermann said.
U.S.: The tomb of Zola is estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman grave, which appeared directly at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art merchant Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the 3rd century after Christ and was always valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "there are four scenes of the Dionysos presented in a sophistic architectural decor, surrounded by satir and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. there are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Sale of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still ongoing, but this part is what the buyers have offered most for so far,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was home for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, which was used in her bathroom in her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in darkness.
When searching for the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "heritage of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Honduras to Mexico has been overturned
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the destroyed Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to his homeland as unacceptable after it was rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation that took place in the night with President Zelaya, it seems to add to the fact that there is no agreement on the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the Immigration Authority, the aircraft ordered by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, has returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to require M. Zelaya to “abdicate” and ask for political asylum for him abroad.
However, the defeated president rejected this because he wanted to return to Mexico as the most embarrassed, official head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a new failure by trying to move me to give up on my cost (...), they wanted me to give up," M. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and well for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the falling president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attacks of some accords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted us a request for resignation, which we unfortunately cannot accept because it does not include an asylum request, said on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, the Putsch government’s Interior Minister, to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I ask for asylum in no country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with Channel Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible withdrawal from Honduras, he had emphasized, would only take place as the president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about M. Zelayas’ departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the defeated president, who had opened to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, after which the military there had strengthened its operation.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, was drowned on June 28, on the day of his organized referendum on preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had surprisingly returned on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves these, he is imprisoned for high trait, accused by the court, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to dissolve M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively voted against M. Zelayas' return to office until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street in recovery, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended with a high on Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance showed a rise in the U.S. stock and its partners: the Dow Jones fell by 0.67%, the Nasdaq fell by 0.33%.
According to the figures at stock closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor’s 500 index was recorded with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different sectors, judged Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the assumption that the market is only focused on "half-filled glasses", she measured.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the U.S. trade balance sheet, “which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit decreased by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trade partners of the United States, according to Christopher Cornell from the company research Economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States have risen over all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers in the last four weeks has fallen "to the bottom of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of 10-year bonds increased to 3,482 percent compared to 3,432 percent on Tuesday night, the profitability of 30-year bonds to 4,492 percent compared to 4,408 percent on Tuesday night.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans exile "Ladies in Weiss"
Several hundred Cuban-powered partisans on Thursday expelled the wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day from political prisoners and also prompted a different protest, which led to a good dozen dissident detained temporarily.
About the forty "Dames in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, were exploded on open streets by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Solders!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There are Fidel and Raul alive!" scandalized the enforced partisans with an elevated faust against the dissident women.
The latter were accompanied by civilians who appeared to “assure their protection.”
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had been held in the morning in Havana, where no people were injured or arrested.
In the Havana district of Vedado, however, a dozen dissidents, who were also taking part in the demonstration held on Thursday in light of the International Day for Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civil police, a AFP reporter confirmed.
Police have, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents expelled by the government’s partisans under force to enter civil vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissident under such circumstances is usually limited to just a few hours.
As supporters of the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, the "Ladies in Weiss" organized an unapproved demonstration for the "Pray for the Release of All Political Prisoners", the number of whose dissident list contains approximately 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been sitting behind gitters.
The Cuban authorities perceive the regime opponents as "soldators" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rare thing in itself is that the Cuban television posted a report on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary" reports.
Cuba, led by a party of unity, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NROs of violating rights and freedoms, in particular the freedom of speech.
Crazy man kills 80-year-old man with a knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A crazy armed with two messers killed a 80-year-old man in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday afternoon and wounded five more people.
According to the first details of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker had wounded the 80-year-old for an unclear reason in or in front of a pharmacy on the Jean-Jaures Boulevard with two measures and this, according to police statements, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has, according to a police officer in the Alliance, been hospitalized with the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triangles, invaded and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured is in life danger as, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to the police, seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence, is expected to escape immediately to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had wounded two other passants, apparently randomly: one thirty and one thirty-year-old, the latter of the two seriously.
The scenario remained in the dark at night.
He had been armed with two meats, which he carried crossed behind his back, Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance Syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine region, said.
Several passengers, including young people, have, according to witness reports found by the AFP, tried to bind the crazy.
I saw a man in the triangles with a green west.
Three young people tried to enter.
They didn’t do it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a servant of a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city police officer who has broken his arm.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their boss, have tried to arrest the armed man and have been wounded with massacres, the police said.
The event took place in one of the main warehouses of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of stores are located.
Passants have come to me to tell me that there is a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man lying on the ground, I put him in a first-help position and noticed a cracking wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, to AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person arrived, wounded by cuts.
Police have finally arrested the man who did not carry any documents.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has commissioned the district report of the Criminal Policeivon Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Due to his status, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude that he is delivered to a nerve therapy facility.
According to another police source, it was six police officers to band him at the police commission in Clichy, where he was thrown away.
He was “in a state of exaggeration” as “all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces liberate themselves during the attack.”
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls for the suspension of prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the U.S.) repeatedly requested the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a seed violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", appealed to three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California on the time of the negotiation in 1977.
I am calling for a sentence in place, M. Hummel explained, before he added that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband commissioned at the time of the trial "let one cold down the back."
According to him, the – now dead – Judge Rittenband, before he made his judgment, discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a farmhouse – which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was pointed out in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), specifically by the prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "laughed".
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel requires the conduct of a proceedings that would allow him to submit the evidence for his argumentation.
The accusation, on its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in first instance, i.e., that a discussion on the cancellation of the offences charged with the accused cannot be taken seriously as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the United States in 1978, even before the penalty was announced for "illegal sexual relationships" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has no longer travelled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "must be there to contribute to the trial."
“Will you spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that escape is a way out?” asks Ms. Asayma.
“The filmmaker asks the court for a favour and thus denies his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even highlighted that “there would be other escape options.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Also the lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, again demanded the cancellation of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer suffer to be disturbed by every resurrection of the Polanski case and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-three years are enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on the grounds of an American arrest order.
After spending two months behind the gitters, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is blocked by the rise of the dollar and is closed without the rate.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a rate in a market that was down and down between better indicators than in the U.S. and a dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures present at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains strictly limited, the trade volume has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "contributed to improve the market perspective on the solidity of the recovery of the economy," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, which is already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of U.S. consumers has significantly improved in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the Index forecast of the University of Michigan.
However, the index was bound by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached its highest level over the euro in two months, pushing down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost a bit on the ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return of the treasury debt over 10 years increased on Wednesday evening by 3,540% compared to 3,482%, and that of the debt over 30 years to 4,497% compared to 4,492% of the previous day.
Miss World elections again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday will overcome the last obstacle to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it before a billion TVs.
During this great beauty fair, which is held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second time in a row, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were nominated as Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true struggle of pleasure.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 17:00 (15:00 Central European time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to give my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I'm happy to have done this experience twice, emphasized Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the re-discovery of "atembracing landscapes".
After a month of gala, samples, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to follow Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It’s of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional tracks and not to forget, in the bathing bag.
The show is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former Queen of Beauty from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a manager of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a hardly over-offed heartbeat and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous Township in Soweto, but this time cost by bicycle and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
It’s not usual for a head of state, said Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the departure in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a way of the country to promote for this event a little more.
I’m wrong with people I’d probably never get closer to.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, everything goes very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, where he arrived shortly after 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go "fastest" to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial infection after an operation at a band dish incident on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and be able to perform his treatment, the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was transmitted into a artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was brought to Paris on Monday after a bacterial infection after a bandage operation on November 26.
The singer had to be operated again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the painful changes resulting from the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer told AFP.
Head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer had a heavy burden on the neurochirurgist Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us he committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disturbed, Mr. Camus explained.
I’ve heard of the possibility that a court proceedings will be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled too fast and this has been with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I contacted this doctor personally, who assured me that he sees this trip as completely problem-free, which was very surprising, as I myself already had two bandage operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer apparently would have left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he was also operated by actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematom after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a doubtful reputation, who has been sentenced several times for misleading operations and not to forget, for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, has described him as "a man without scrap", who has to be responsible "regularly" before the Chamber Board and is "all other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention would have been "perfect" and the postoperative examinations would have been "normal".
“The operation did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drenage,” he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have grown since last summer, seems questioned.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus said.
The party alliance UDF (Union for the French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre to no longer use its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou’s party MoDem, on Friday reacted strongly to a triumph attempt by the party formerly founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, by the party’s chairman Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him, under the threat of a court proceedings, to no longer use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF sign as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The Defense Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claimed the property of the brand UDF, as he was the first to apply for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the business office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by the friends of François Bayrous, broke the silence and made clear that they were not allowed to intercept and set the minister and the deputy, under the threat of judicial prosecution, a deadline to no longer use this seal and to transfer the property rights of the brand to them.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to sign the UDF + take +, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF +, on its political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF headquarters declared and calls on the party NC to "uninterruptly remove the mention of the name UDF from all materials as well as from (your) website".
In addition, it was requested from Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal claimants."
If you refuse this, we will file a complaint against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and remind that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave this 2007 to set up a competitive movement as other people had already done in 2002 to set up the party "UMP".
The party Nouveau centre therefore, according to the signatories, has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) sign.
They continue to remind that the UDF’s last congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party as well as the establishment of a business station to defend “the material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the agency continues, “he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he requested the brand name” but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the deposit of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
Furthermore, let’s keep in mind that this negligence is on the best way to transform itself into a crime, and ironize the NC’s strategy: “It seems to us, both in politics and in life, more expensive to make a name to ourselves than to try to come out of anonymity by fraudulently attaching a name to which you have no legal claims.”
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is sentenced for exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, has spent a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to waste a part of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his starphotos, will be charged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness before the court, a crime that is sentenced with a maximum three-year imprisonment and a fine of €375,000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this case that is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter breathe and at the same time have the traces of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
The 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented during the investigations by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to submit a report before March 10, 2010 in which you clearly know if and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I’m going to talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the judgment of the court.
The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that one has to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited the weakness of her mother for years to shed donations of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the complaint initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers on Friday led to a large family gap.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt appealed on three letters sent by her client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she disbelieved the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “You can please explain to my daughter that I’ve been writing about bananas for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
“I’ve never been able to talk to Francis since her marriage.”
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre again believes that the applicant had no right to respond, especially because a prime judge in the last days has rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no predecessor.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the proceedings for the admission of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Management Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Awareness?
When nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been useless.
For more than a decade, the position of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis to the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determines the best as it was before to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer in the center of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the site ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose the customer’s preferences again regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the peak of a much larger phenomenon, which especially affects employees.
This demobilization negatively affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&Eund, which is even more critical, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for “proactive action and a future-oriented view” from all stakeholders; it calls for an engagement from the employees to which the instructions of the authority management are completely contrary.
That’s why we call for an operational revolution that would consist in placing employees in the middle of the company’s concerns equally rightly next to the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinions, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its wage recipients, encourage this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I was afraid, unfortunately not.
First of all, because I was able to find that, in the light of a new situation, the whole array, after many circumstances, eventually is forced to do what it has always done.
Also because authority – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Transmitted from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort they take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the U.S. "Neurosciences" and unconsciously widely spread by research institutions and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "Hebel" (sic) for the engagement of employees, an Ipsos survey published on Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any thought or practice of management: for the wage recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of motivating employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a prescribed doxa, which allows them through their perceived image of the company to assess what it offers them to their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate managers can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and place their Human Resource Management in the right place.
Thus they create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the harmonised development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: 'Right War' brings Obama praise from right
The US rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had spotted the award to Obama on October 9th, this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of former Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2008 election Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the Republican party's right-wing flagship in the US Today newspaper, adding that he himself brought the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war into the memoirs published alongside him.
War is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo tried to justify the use of violence; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech completely historical, explained Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The previous deputy, which is considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "president of the Left" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they "will not be free and not be able to award a peace prize if the use of violence would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to describing himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he said "as an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they haven't created themselves and for whose protection they don't do much," Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvenient rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Falk of the Bush Age, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "unpleasant, high-traffic and inspirational."
On the left of the president, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich appears concerned about how Barack Obama defends recourse to the armed forces.
If the war is packed under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the media of the moderate left remains praising on the president’s side.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still believed that the Nobel Prize was awarded early to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him, known for his talent, a “monumental work.”
The Oslo speech "provides an outcome plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California Daily said.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "dirty and exemplary at the same time."
Remote Drivers: Three Marathons for a Agreement That Guarantees Christmas Supply
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road union and the TLF – the only employer organization that remained until the end – came to an agreement on Friday evening to end the strike order and the threatening heavy supply pass on Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly late morning.
And that though the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 p.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict " would have caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to fear that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a salary increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“It’s not so much, but we’re starting small,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now asked not to block the supply centers anymore.
"But there will always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although it was "this salary increase was difficult to settle in the light of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the lowest and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on a healthy human mind and respect for the employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “a historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about a "acceptable compromise" in this regard.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the preservation of the total road transport rate in the first half of 2010, which in particular will enable the issue of the 13th month fee and the modernization of tariff agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the decrease of taxes for employers in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government proposal for amendment to the draft law on the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday night.
The government calls for a “identity” vote from the Senate.
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the enterprises affiliated with that organization, and then to apply for the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time," Bussereau said.
The opposition of the workers can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR has called for a “fake trade” because the 100 million euros “have already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to throw the Gans' ears in the coming Christmas days, Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "cover a big grave to the industry's small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest fast railway network in France for the Paris Grand Area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), which keeps the strikers waiting with their demands for salary additions.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains were running between 10:00 and 20:00. on the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to move.
The shop chain Galeries Lafayette, which accounts for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “the RATP strives to lock the big shops in traffic technology.”
The RER A line passes through the Paris Ballungsraum from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the locations Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains were scheduled to the main traffic time, and almost no during the traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no humankind on the railways as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had settled on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than otherwise, mainly due to the lack of high school classes.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work timely."
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers by staff and staff, pointed out that there were no disturbances at Saint-Lazare Station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed over the Saint-Lazare Station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results that the associations had classified as "dueful" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon were reviewed.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, work routes, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want. according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage added.
The CGT was embarrassed that the RATP itself puts its salary add-on proposals in collapse and emphasized that the leadership “is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP clearly stated that a new meeting was scheduled for the "comprehensive examination of the working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows to the associations that the company “ignors the weekend drivers.”
Around 150 drivers searched for the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leader who so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and brought a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a salary add-on from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents).
Drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of €2,200 to €2,700 as well as a salary add-on of €600 to €650 for layer services as well as day-to-day and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed by the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to enormously complicate the government’s work, which is trying to give the hand to the Kurdish community to put an end to the 25 year-long conflict.
The “Party for a Democratic Society” (DTP) was dissolved as it has become a “place for activities that are harmful to the state’s independence and its inseparable unity,” said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would be taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution. he also pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which enjoy Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the judgment that the parliamentarians would prefer to leave the parliament than to meet as unparliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. he accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and numerous other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it will have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court ranks between the government that seeks to confront the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to let the support of the PKK by the Kurds be dismissed and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a dissolution could lead to a rebound of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the prison conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to collisions with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million city of Diyarbakir in Southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The police deployed drilling gas grenades and waterfalls when the protesters began to throw molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Turk assumed that the court’s decision “will further deepen the despair.”
“Turkey can’t clarify this issue by prohibiting a party,” he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party derived from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We are opposed by principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems,” Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
“This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government,” said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
“It is obvious that you can get caught on a reaction of the PKK,” he added.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days ago, which was one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snowfall may come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes.
Not because he wants to shock the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Instead, so that its employees can try and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
It may be the first time this week, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
As soon as there is surface-covering snow in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes will be dropped with large-scale vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main traffic and passing roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighters, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with crashes, such as the Atzelberg Road.
The service of the FES begins at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers should be stretched in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which is better suited.
This is why the FES starts at 3 p.m., "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It’s hard if it’s snow only at 7:30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to place the trailers."
Only after that, if there is no further snow, the Zubringer- and Close-Roads, which also belongs to the Rat-Beil-Roads, are on the line.
Last priority are side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At 5 a.m. the peoples of the FES go on the way, the danger points and transitions are prioritized.
For all roads the FES usually cannot take care.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps mostly the bridges in mind from 22 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
Since it is on this fast fluid, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the strike is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The Wing of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: the two-metre long and 1.50-metre large animal ran on two strong backs, had a long neck with sharp, bowed teeth, short arms with seafood rabbits and a long swallow.
If the species lived a few million years later, it would not be special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangäa on the Ecuador.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relative relationships, the spread and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a funeral at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the trias, team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Found confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it’s an exceptional finding: “Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, mostly you find only individual fragments.”
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the attribution of these original dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Thus, for example, the experts are debating when the eggs broke up in their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-foot sauropods and their relatives known as "langhals", and the plants-eating ornithischia (bird-beckensaurier), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the neck of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found indications of air bags, as they also own the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bag, the breathing of birds is more efficient than the breathing of mammals.
In Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive therapod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the enormous sauropods later also had air bags and light-building bones, the common advance of the two groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers follow that the eggs appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which then formed a single land mass as the supercontinent of Pangäa.
This is the fact that the team, together with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two other, not closely related theropods.
The three cannot be derived from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says the Bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image because in South America just a lot of primitive dinosaur fossils have remained preserved, while on other continents it is hardly possible to find anything.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile tribe to the dominant farmers of the Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and the airsaurians, and with numerous other eggs.
At the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the relativity on the border extended from the trias to the jury.
Success story did not last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion caused a group of animals to flourish, which had also evolved in the Trias, and since then a shadow existence: the breastfeeding.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto stand at the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police displacement of the occupied casino at the Frankfurt Goethe University is causing waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers from the Goethe University, but also from universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with the protesting students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “missleep” the police action caused by the presidency.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been shattered.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signators judge, did not justify “the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command.”
The dismissal represents a “unacceptable intervention” in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves the “delegitimation and criminalization of the protest” and leads away from the contents.
The presidency has taken away the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate ceasefire of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage, it is said.
Protests are legitimate
The youth of the Verdi Union and the German Union are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of an increasing concern about its own future, says Verdi-Landes youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the Unipresident and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in an current hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have understanding for the protest, but no understanding for vandalism, according to CDU Deputy Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Green and Left saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a prejudice to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, it was rumored.
The left has submitted a request that calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
The Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, unavailable to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow's capital, was a strictly guarded site for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have linked contacts with the Frankfurt Science site Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "protocol for closer cooperation".
Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd headed the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed Planning Deputy Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Scientific Fosching Headquarters will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to acquire orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd ( literally translated "Green City") received its name from the wooden hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
by Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 is not sufficiently high.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about “the new heart of Europe.”
S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will break down the city of the Baden-Württemberg land capital for a decade in unhealthy building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railways with trails that ended in the city were then considered as traffic-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brakes of a modern rail traffic, as it once took a huge amount of time to reboot locomotives from back to forward.
Riding, staying short, walking further – that’s how it’s going.
And that’s why the headlines should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passenger railway station, which is about half the trail of the transeuropean railway magistrals between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – therefore the slogan of the “heart of Europe”.
S21 is actually being approached now, although the vision of the 80s has long been not compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessic and Bavarian major cities to implement the depth layer.
However, headsets also have no problem with entrance and exit, since there are modern wheels with drivers and drivers on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new building route to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and local politicians have followed it.
The train contributes, even because the risks of the largest infrastructure single project the Republic carries the taxpayers and not the state group.
The project can be somewhat justified.
There is a new city dream, which - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
The S21 is harmful to the rail system.
The transit station and the route extension are intended for the passenger transport, which was attributed - typically in the 1980s - to enormous growth.
At that time there was no competition of the cheap flights.
Modern transport policy, however, must first go to strengthening the goods transport, as rail transport is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for cargo trains due to severe rise.
More seriously, the S21 indirectly plays many other rail projects as well.
A total of 6 billion euros will be banned in Switzerland.
This is the official number.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing on other nodes and blocks on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 kilometers long route through the Rhintal.
Since 1987 it has been built on the trail in time-leap pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
However, the S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintal Trail becomes the bottle hole for international goods transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government investigates court judgment on airport
The state government has revealed in Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go into review against the judgment of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof (VGH) on night flight prohibition.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to lawfully review the more than 400-page VGH judgment, economic minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had written reasoning that the country should re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest landway at the Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the state government stipulates, is not to be agreed with the statutory protection of the population from nightly flight noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it will go into review against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this suspension and urged the representatives of the government to refuse a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election on a night flight ban.
It’s hard to keep his word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP’s slogan “We keep the word.”
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "righteousness and tricks".
A thorough legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure solution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The U.S. big banks are pushing off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America returned the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in a total of $45 billion (good $30 billion) to a hit.
Citigroup also plans to refund state aid, according to a report by the U.S. broadcaster CNBC.
Thus, the institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation of the payment of managerial bonuses and the settlement of high fees.
The Bank of America had worried about $19 billion of fresh money from investors over variable bonds.
The rest of the amount she took from her own cash, which was well filled with, among other things, savings sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night: The money export has helped during a very difficult time.
The monetary house had come to the peak of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also intends to acquire money on the capital market in order to get rid of its liabilities to the state.
Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. Bank could announce a $20 billion heavy increase in its capital, CNBC, calling on circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn’t want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Fast choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Nearly two weeks after the ZDF’s Board of Directors had pushed the chief editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Yesterday night, the group wanted to vote on the staff.
The favorite was Peter Frey, the head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially, in order not to interfere with the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role not to further harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schächter, if this proposal should not pass through the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schacher's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the group.
The result of the vote was not confirmed at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a hard defeat for the shockers, a expected though.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signed weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in office.
The opposition was organized against the chief editor of the Hessic Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender had lost ZDF’s news broadcasts at the entry rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly anticipated chief editor.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was swept.
Lastly, even 35 state lawmakers were involved in the debate, who considered Koch’s action unconstitutional.
It has nothing to benefit.
to the person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogics and romantics.
He then worked at Southwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey switched to the ZDF, first to the "Today Journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent of the chief editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional draft after Brenders was elected as the journalist of the year on Wednesday by the Medium magazine.
Koch's counterpart in the Board of Directors, the Rheinland-Palestine Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, one of the party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory bodies was excluded by Beck.
Brender's predictable successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board with a wise chess - by strongly criticizing the board immediately after Brender's election.
Thanks to this testimony of journalistic independence, he could be nominated as chairman without a loss of face for the post of the chief editor as well as the board of directors, without getting into suspicion of nominating a party member to the post.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is allocated to the left-liberals.
Study is interrupted
Part Success for Students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally led on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Directors Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the conditions of study at the Bachelor and Master.
Students should also be able to handle their studies in the future.
In individual, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: Basically, each study module should be completed with only one examination.
In addition, the workload of students will be reviewed and "a realistic and affordable level" will be guaranteed.
Politics and universities also aim to facilitate the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master's programs more flexible.
There should be no different country arrangements.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have been wearing the flattered word of better studyability in their mouth.
For the first time, it was filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module usually ends with only one examination," it is said in a 30-page paper that is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the examination burden," said the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, "there should be a "fake development involvement that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the “studyability” in the future is to be “the decisive criterion” in the design.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "unnecessary involvement of students in the choice of
Events will be avoided.
Students would have "a claim to obtain spaces that enable and promote their own initiative."
The rules shall apply to the admission of new, but also to the review of existing studies.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – which however means that it will take up to 2015 until all of the studies have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies across the country are responsible for this, under the accreditation council established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October "with insistance" to intervene on the agencies so that the substance is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In each federal country, universities and high schools have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz added additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The funds are intended for the universities to establish tutor programs and to strengthen study counseling as well as examination and overseas agencies.
The country and universities are planning to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government plans to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act to the Parliament.
After that, only one exam will be required to complete a study model.
The study design is aimed at making it more flexible, as well as ensuring the recognition of proof of performance at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
By the end of the next year, all of the country’s study programmes will be reviewed for their studyability.
The government and opposition discussed the conditions of study in the country on Thursday.
Besides praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso High School Groups called for the formation of the education policy to no longer take place "between closed doors" of the ministers and higher education directors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students should now also be "a word to speak" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the President of the Higher Education Directors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK will discuss a joint reform paper.
The Union of Education and Science (GEW) went the Bonner decisions in general not far enough: It demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor's degree to access a further master's program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that there will be sufficient master's places with the best possible study conditions available for today's generation of bachelor's students tomorrow, GEW's board member Andreas Keller said.
The countries need to hire more teachers.
The ministers of culture did not express themselves on the free access to the master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Into Germany and out is pretty much no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing speeches thema the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost his speeches.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurter poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is the head of the Hessische Literaturforum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a significant non-literary appearance on Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its securities".
Visibly uncertain and shameful, Söllner read a statement in which he agreed to his collaboration with Romanian German writers colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as IM for the Romanian intelligence service Securitate.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The application attempts had begun rapidly, first in 1971.
I’m, Söllner concluded, “so someone who has not defended enough against attempts to intimidate the Securitate.”
Werner Söllner is in Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize award for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is shocked by a case that makes known the grounds and degradation of a political system based on supervision and respect.
Werner Söllner is, as far as it can be said, not only an assassin, but also a victim.
In his Securitate act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner to literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence for him by IM Walter.
He’s pulled him out in all the points that were distinctive for him at that time,” Markle said.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in the form and in the face of this audience unexpected, but completely surprising is the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own documents, 914 pages.
The affected, so can be suspected, are speculated and in some cases they probably knew what clear name hid behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike the very process-safe view of the Stasi-acts in this country, the handling of the backdrop of Securitate Monitoring is still very diffus.
A systematic awareness has been delayed and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities, the National Council for the Processing of Securities Acts (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, but the issue of the acts has since gone rather slowly.
Only since 2005 there has been a law that regulates the administration of the acts.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, revealed after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller a interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar discouraged about the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was heard only once.
The infamie of the power meant here to be able to express in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, in the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden guilt, inevitable questions are linked.
The obsessive reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s promise leads to hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by debt allocation and shame.
The recovery of Herta Müller’s work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Satisfaction of Champions League
It seemed like there was just an adrett dressed outer service from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sports item manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored plastic bag of the equipment, climbed into a refined C-class a quarter hour after midnight.
The man with the markant glow allowed himself to drive because of the city that was still strange to him.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and washed before luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant night, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or just go right.
In the words of the only three days earlier committed Switzerland: "We have achieved the eighth final," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we should not let ourselves blind from the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the fall."
The “more important task” is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the performance of the royal classes in the daily life of the league in Mainz.
And the completely reopened weaknesses after the rapid three doors by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Release
The Champions League eighth final (Games 16/17. + 23/24 February / Returns 9/10 + 16/17. March) will be held in Nyon on December 18.
So the joy of the fulminant instance of the Babbel's successor remained behaved.
Not only with the alleged healing provider, who in the short time gave the uncertain Stuttgarter professional self-confidence, commitment willingness and play joy.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them to be more courageous, Gross explained the so simple recipes of success that under therapist Babbel had no more effect.
He has invented some magic, Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, “When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you’t have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamics, advanced to the best player on the square, tried to describe the established “fenomen” with the literal “fresh wind” and the way the new boss works: “He’s a man who trips and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obvious.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns Sports Board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs constance.
Like Gross, players and managers had to overestimate the victory against a replacement weak and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came, Khedira said to consider.
And Sports Board Horst Heldt said that although one season goal was achieved, the other is still far away.
We are not above the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not after celebrations on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was about the events of the weekend, which in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the game began by Torhüter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, he countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of directors of leadership weakness and decided to change the coach on the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that his free day after games had been deleted, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and misguise.
Lehmann’s statements were “characterized by pure egoism,” Heldt rejected and announced consequences for the finalist.
You probably won’t be friends for life anymore, the two thirty years old.
After all, however, they agreed with all the others that without the preparations by the trainer team solved the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Cup in Heavy Weight
Hot duel in Bern: Ever and ever challenging Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy-weight title according to the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges came unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion according to WBC's version defeated the U.S. Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian has already been the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work with the K.O., which everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional battles, two times he had to beat himself due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2,02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the struggle especially with his left leadership hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klichko era before the duel, nevertheless escaped the world champion's strikes, so that Klichko couldn't put his dangerous rights decisively to the target.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his strikes rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who has gone with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had cared for some curves before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He accused Klitschko of being a “horrible zombie” who “can’t do anything right.”
The champion was then provoked on Friday to throw Johnson the sun glasses out of his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expulsion, he had then hit the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "WBC" gate, which he had previously had to give up fightlessly.
This year he then attracted Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the U.S. in September.
I only got one blow in this battle and I'm physically very good in shape, had Klitschko justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt, however, is carried by the British David Haye, after he was able to escape the 2.13-meter Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously canceled a September-planned battle against Vitali Klitschko this summer.
It is said that his promotional company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembleystadion in London.
Case of Kunduz
Front attack from the opposition: Green group chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the Left are calling for information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings about Kunduz's airstrike, the opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone a conscious misconduct.
The minister said "consciously the untruth" about the deadly bombing on two tanks from September, Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It is called landlord: He has lied.
The murder order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped loads, but also about targeting two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. air strike requested by the German Kunduz commander Oberst Klein, according to a NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Green, SPD and Left called on Saturday for Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether a targeted killing strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Federal Army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast asked.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office has not influenced the Federal Army's concrete operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry’s presentation of the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have informed correctly and fully about the background of the tanklaster attack.
Officially it had been revealed that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and left the minister sensitive details.
However, the surroundings of the two top officials stated that they had even notified the Ministry of Defense on several reports, including a bilateral document of the commander Major Klein and a field hunting report.
In the meantime, Wichert has asked for clarification in a letter, the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports.
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not speak about the accusations on Saturday and said that this will be clarified in the Bundestag’s investigative committee, which wants to constitute itself on Wednesday.
The dream world
Some people see images and hear voices that others don’t see or hear.
Not only in mental illness and drug shock, the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is okay.
When we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can unhinderly give ourselves to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions, see and hear things that others don’t see or hear, in the modern Western world are mostly considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as a special lion.
However, such images and voices arise not only in mental illness or drug shock.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality disappear.
Traumatically altered awareness conditions can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Though the triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mysticist Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic depression conditions, psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or misconceptions arise when the balance of the neuronal bodies of the brain – all of them dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – is dissolved and the interaction of different brain components is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and foolish thoughts occur very often during a schizophrene psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of madness and dream has engaged philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 a "great similarity of irresense with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all disagreements, madness, sensual disturbances of such."
It is Autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he slows on the room cover.
He feels a trick.
Behind him swallowed devil shapes with blood-red, distorted fries, toothblinking.
They hunt him, hit him with heavy, flamming bottles, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Loud, malicious voices run out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that shame and offend him.
Henning T. throws two cables out of the stereo installation, knocks them into a slider and fixs them on a hole on the roof.
He climbs to a speaker and puts the slider around his neck.
and jump.
The slurry dissolves.
That should be a lesson to you, the voices cry in a trombocelled chorus, "Go to the clinic and let you heal!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It is caused by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, manic, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The fake images are cruel reality.
About one percent of the population is affected by schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophric psychosis, the affected people mostly can no longer distinguish between the inner and external world, they fall into an overwhelming state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Specifically common is the voice hearing – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare as well.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the slopes for a flow of ideas and fantasies that arise from deeper layers of consciousness.
The reality perception in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Clinic.
The schizophrene is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time, he goes into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Thus, schizophrens often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is mostly impossible for them, the fraud images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in your life, you have experienced a hallucination.
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains essentially preserved."
The foolish thoughts and hallucinations pass in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain hits capriols, researchers are still facing mystery.
Emergency conditions can cause any person to lose the relationship to reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the solitary determining factors.
Researchers predict that there are minimal brain damage in the affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain in a early stage of development is disturbed by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery about how the disorder of the neuronal system occurs, which is also not manifested at first over many years.
Environmental impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the disposal is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis as they interfere in the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and sweat expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get, says Lübeck's psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether fraud images are seen as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and fraud phenomena for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The irrealistic world in our heads."
Although hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, they also belong to surprisingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and cervical trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people hallucinates itself.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory content that is normally retained.
They occur when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or a psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, love room or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the high school there.
A normal girl, in fact.
If there were no pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a slow boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it responds to him, the colleagues look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the scary girl is a scary day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows it.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel her presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Is I crazy? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other tricks are not real and disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are mostly scary.
Often the fake images are also a burden.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the lesson, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just depicts a new colleague, while he explains mathematical equations for all the others hearing and visible on the table.
In the night, the phenomena are mostly scary.
When she is waiting for the sleep in her dark room, which comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams, whether the images she sees, the fries or the girl with the bloody scratches on her arms and legs, before her open or closed eyes.
Let me be quiet, call the shapes.
Her parents and friends don't tell her anything about what they'd think they're crazy.
August 2009 Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She went to school last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she’s not mad.
Madness is also an artwork of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from an irritation, he is very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underoccupied and takes care of its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often played her alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Dad since she could think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, it’s hard for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish fraud and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain, so they are so real.”
Even night dreams also value the box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrens, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their fraud images as irrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to evaluate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our very conscious world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Doctor of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also brings positive, creative – madness is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically changed awareness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the state of awakening even later.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in traumatic or disease-related extreme situations, for example, in patients with polyradiculitis who experience a motor blurry with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example, by continuous, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality situation with his own imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
As it is impossible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the reality situation is passed in imagination.
An intense form of mind-stimulation and self-stimulation in an in itself unbearable situation, which allows us to have our own design capabilities not to undergo anything of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
Also the Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a salvation action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart attack with a subsequent heart transplant, while his body is condemned to immobility at the intensive station.
Claussen drops into a self-made world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedless, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot keeps his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce contaminants from blood.
When a Greek is trapped on a motorcycle in his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner trips are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental trips are overwhelming to me after years and in subjective details.
More clear and more intense than actually experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Lastly, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug shock show how brilliant our inner images of external reality are also in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes, “can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.”
A experience that can be enriching.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company is expected to be 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
The details have been carefully arranged.
The question of whether they are active in the company comes only after that.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
You can't plan your children to 7500 employees if they're not sufficiently skilled.
This affects the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Board of Directors from January, and named Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the corporate assets came to it and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "breaking over 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100% of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Schickedance and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family companies are not secure of the collapse: “This always concerned families that were infected by a capital illness, who have completely speculated and thought they could thus rise to a great player.
My strategy was never that.
He had no "world power dreams" according to Burda.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’, these shops have become too big.
The perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has done, who recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2im shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you can find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide laser hair removal; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairstyles Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that comes through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
To enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxing area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massage and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments as well as for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, in addition there are also virtual coaches who take care of the customer’s training units and thus provide them with a completely personal training.
A training unit begins with entering a personal password on a touch screen that is located in front of the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training units properly.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching exercises) are entirely enough to train the body muscles.
And if you then, after training your body, still want to go through the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for the restoration of hair flavor, glow and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the center of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. early to 22 a.m. evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and that’s why it’s again a good opportunity to copy the star’s appearance and take their fast clothes into our closet.
The form of the decollet, which is very important to raise the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen a exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endesa has jointly created the “LIVE Office” with the city of Barcelona.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is just being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transportation of the future.
3 “Electrical Cities”
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This Framework Agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include, among others, such activities that are related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standarding groups across Europe and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a “horizon of peace” for the automotive sector
The president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, propheted the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country’s largest exporter, “a horizon of peace.”
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President, Zapatero once again reminded the government’s efforts to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of the neglect and depletion of some of our main production works," the Prime Minister said.
“Through this plan and the automaker’s willingness to produce in a highly competitive industry in Spain in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the Zukunt of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Total Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 automotive manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The head of government said that these investments are intended both for the development of new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also emphasized the government’s efforts to boost demand, referring to the Plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the emissions of the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the licenses, which rose "about 40%" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine in the Mazda3 model, named i-Stop, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 benzin engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out by its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its trave behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All of these aspects are “very good” with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good standing.
Furthermore, the race game is excellent.
When further considering the unit, which consists of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors of red and blue, is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further mention that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are deprived of the newness of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can ride the car very conveniently.
All of this comes with a large and clearly shaped luggage room.
The stop and drive system is currently available only for the 2-litre 150 hp gasoline engine and a 6 switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It rises out by its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with a benzin engine due to its gross comfort in the switching and its low consumption, even though Mazda is especially the most sold diesel models.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called sporty model selected for the trial is a special feature, as it has a significantly greater number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series adjustment, the Assistant for Track Change (RVM) emerges, which thus removes the dead corner, but also the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed regulation, the light-sensitive interior, the board computer with a gross screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, as well as the encrypted 17-inch folds.
Furthermore, this version also includes, as if it was not enough of equipment, the Premium package, which for additional 1,500 euros contains the following: in addition to other elements, especially the learningable Bixenon screens and the BOSE sound system with CD-Lader.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is excellent in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behavior and the diversity of equipment.
In addition, those who don’t walk many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 benzin engine of 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its a bit high price, which is between €21,770 for the luxury model and €23,270 for the sporty model.
In exchange for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us a new highest pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensitivity for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, raised more than ever (photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It its five-minute fame when it chose the magazine Time as one of the products of the year.
To see it on the track is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still especially of interest for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very affordable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success with it, it has launched two new devices: one that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong grate service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly accommodation price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the country’s border or when you desperately look for a cafe with WIFI (or an option of connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for overseas stays, but according to my experience, you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glass to read all the small printed.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates for Europe has almost always remained ignored.
Beyond your own country, you’re always afraid to read your emails and that’s right.
That a small device like FonPeek (while it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/Wi-Fi) can offer this kind of rates means that telephone providers have to slowly but safely re-think and begin to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
Without vetrages and without haken.
This is an internet-capable device and you pay for it only once, namely when you buy, and not a month for a month.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a lifelong Internet access shopping option as the Peek already offers in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama came to office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a mantle of that color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama was wearing very similar models in both occasions: after that it was almost the same color - a glowing green-blue - the clothes consisted of three parts - clothes, jackets and mantles of the same material, and for this she was wearing somewhat grossly shaped or a neck chain.
It is even so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturia and decided to wear the same dress for more than just one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ greatly in the type of material from which they are made.
At the beginning of office, she wore a dress from the top and in Oslo a dress from the fit.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high pieces and for the second time an elegant model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was high-covered at this occasion as a haircut, at the previous it wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 makes no doubt: 75% of women working see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are severe differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they do.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, only work half-day or have no fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women with a fixed employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
“Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment receive their first child in average only 3.7 years after the co-education, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have taken longer to this and who have co-educated their first child only much later.
Moreover, the type of work has a serious impact on maternity, though less than the calendar in terms of pregnancy,” says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account with the age of women in marriage and the first child.
The age at the time of marriage and the first child is higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a primary degree or a higher education, in average each with 25.1 or 32.1 were mother for the first time.
Also, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women with primary degree marry before their first fixed appointment and get their first child, women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly different and first seek a fixed appointment and then marry and then get their first child, says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its all-injured list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the widely known advertising phrase "For you are worth it."
Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses at the international level, will become another famous actress like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's playmate in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual award ceremony held at the Royal Court of Justice in London.
For that occasion they all appeared.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) the three-dimensional X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
In this, he does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but is looking for a holiness to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent doesn’t save on horror or illumination.
Being aware that this book is a delicious reading gift, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
“When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God.”
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegoric Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a rebellious poetical humor, without any sense, like the knives that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was trapped by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, dermaves in her bond, in whose flesh the emotions, because of marriage, united with the pleasure of regret, a spiritual privilege that consists in coming to heaven on the path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 by Sylvia Beach in Paris. it is one of the 8,000 summits in world literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, on which the best mountain climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: “It was a funny case.
Sometimes he said about himself that he would be the inheritance of a good owner of the county and once again he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams gave rise to a certain groove.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy scream that was written out of a bridge by that personality from Munich so that his echo went deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knipped up and prayed: My worshiped God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses of Spencer embraced: 'the sleep after the effort, / after the storm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a saturated life you find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spy them between the Azaleen or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neuroscientist whose literary talent was much greater than her madness.”
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do other than trying to push Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy that man's glory, so that he could put himself on this podest?"
terrible aggression
My 70-year-old mother went on a walk through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age fled next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer who we have taken out of the zoo and who just weighs six kilograms, and then from heated heaven they missed him two footsteps and wounded him seriously.
Our disturbance can’t be seen in words, because it’s incomprehensible for us where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the line.
Additionally, a woman who was going to walk comfortably got the shock when she wanted to reject these people because of the incident, she was even afraid of her own life, because if such a madman attacked a dog, he might do the same with a woman, a child, a older gentleman, or probably even with anyone weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet city district at 5 a.m. on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been hunting all day.
Of course, we have returned an advertisement at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the feedy criminals were Spanish.
Our disappointment about what has happened has caused us to announce this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly use the helmet
Michelin has launched a campaign in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial) to promote helmet use especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to highlight the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent headaches or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to traffic safety, which “includes much more than just the design and manufacture of products that become more and more secure with each day” and continued to emphasize that it will also contribute with other actions of educational and informative character to bring this goal a step closer every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops to the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin emphasized that traffic safety is a "continuous concern" of the company, and just because it, as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, is always committed to that one of its main objectives must be the development of increasingly safer products.
The sales of small trucks are rising again.
After almost two years, the small transport car market finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first growth ever after 22 consecutive months with constant decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the automotive dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are at the moment only to be taken with great caution, as the reference data used to compare are from November 2008, which was a bad decay year with a decline of 60 % compared to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, in addition to the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all of the vehicles that make up the small transport market: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transports, small shipping cars and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds in the sky are still the ones that attract the demand most in compassion, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the gross portion of the sales goes to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases do the purchase with a third-party funding.
Thus, these restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions’ allocation of money, must include other factors, such as the increase in unemployment rate or the decrease of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has little helped.
However, this plan is not only for individuals, even self-employed and small have the right to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission that should not exceed 160 grams per kilometre riding, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded that it is essential for the state to pay special attention to these small locks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trains and buses).
The automotive dealers’ association predicts for the year 2010 a year similar to the previous year, for which it expects a sales decline (for passenger cars and land cars) of 19%.
Support for brake maneuver in critical situations is now mandatory
As at the time with the anti-blocking brake system ABS and as it is now happening with the stability control ESP, the emergency brake assistance systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and small-sized carriers, for the remaining vehicles a carrier period was established until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union is aimed at improving the protection of passengers, but these brake systems can also help prevent many accidents due to their functioning.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver that recognizes the system using the brake strength performed by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exercise that pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident did not come to the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not broken down with full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the contrary, invades the brake system with maximum strength and thus reduces the brake time and thus the brake distance a car holds down during the brake process.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which fighters are injured could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would even be fewer accidents - one is expected that one in four accidents with human damage could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (through a radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time it already exercises a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responds, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors expires plans for Opel to January
While the employees of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. car manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will that the party concerned will give its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
By contrast, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab will be made in the coming days.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which is back covered by the Russian Converg group, is getting stronger.
If there is no agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to sleep Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to beined.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and actually managed to make it 80 kilograms easier, bringing it now only 1,275 kilograms to the weight.
To do so, they first abandoned the automatic clampable roof, replaced by a cell wall roof with manual drive, so alone they saved 21 kilograms; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioner again 13; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters, so further 7 kilograms were saved; by installing sports bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch folds again five saved.
Then, through the abandonment of the CDR-30 audio system, one was again six kilograms less, and by the exchange of the doorgraphs by graphs from material, the missing kilograms were achieved.
Although it is also available with the PDK double-double drive, the trial was carried out with a vehicle with six-way hand drive, mainly on the smaller countryside of California, on mountainous trails that were really very curved.
In his conduct, you can only give him the note.
However, the reduction of his weight has not in any way led to the fact that he would no longer be so secure on the track.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and light model, which also gives you a feeling of great safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low run in the necessary time until we give him the instructions to shave, brake, rest and then again to get everything out of his engine ...
The car does everything we show him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to his control, which is both communicative and accurate.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all flavours
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and can be increased with the ‘sport’ option as well as through a system that can change the motor noise, which has already been used for the first time at Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether it’s out of stand or again accelerating.
The feeds are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land trains on which we were driving with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the slopes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and that, though we found some of these curves ice in the morning grain and rollsplitt in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an undescribed journey, as otherwise it is probably rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and costs €70,831
The Bag Girl
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same necklace as her pockets from Chanel.
Much more than “Bad Girl” or “It Girl”, she’s a “Bag Girl”.
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus reached the first place within his group after the grown appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triangles (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of engagement and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 valued triangles contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Rots, who set themselves at the top on the ad table from the beginning.
Since the first four teams from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to assume that they had come to the field with well-heated gloves.
There were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava chose for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received when he returned to the team with pfiffs and applause, which is his home to expand their advantage further to the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already liked to guess that this would not be the Brazilian's best evening.
Nevertheless, the game, despite the clear advantage in the break, was not long decided, and the Makkahers wanted to remind the Vitorians again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the ever-attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "golden" turning the row (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a couple of games with encounter certainty to get back air and at one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three consecutive triangles and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the ad table again was shown a calming distance of (54-67) that the host was able to shed at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaveses were blowed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they honestly deserved in the first three-minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put out of place because of fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still regained in the last minute (80-85), the game had already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from being given the face
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the leadership in group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was characterized by the failures by the players of Unicaja (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which facilitated the Greeks the victory.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship or of the opponent team, which is one of the strongest in Europe and possesses a lot of money.
A aggressive defense and three consecutive triangles, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja event, even though the local team with an internal match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis managed to show the advertising table in the 13th minute 22-20 to their benefit, the minute in which it would have almost come to the battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to get warm and his superiority on both sides, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to a injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the interior and the Lithuanian front player Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they raised their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A rescue was impossible.
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite his 19 losses, showed himself superior and even managed to balance the difference in the match held in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which again led the leadership within the group to change.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the departure of the injured Scott Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to Cook's lead and triangle and Lewis' use, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the corb area, was not to be removed.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the corb difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to withdraw the leadership to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new app Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, experience their salary they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a Facebook form available to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker in average feels "bad paid," said Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross income of 45.226 euros and a French receives 31.059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros a Spanish earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual income of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a servant with an annual net worth of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with an amount of 14,725 euros and the work of a worker with an amount of 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of one driver, half-day stations and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President withdrawn from office must leave the diplomatic office at the latest on 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially expiry.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he had to have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must go on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he must seek a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the re-cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
Following the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo came as a winner), Zelaya assured that he would stay in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get asylum in Brazil.
This failed, however, in Zelayas’ refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which he wanted to force by the “de facto” government under the leadership of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most exciting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising in any case, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about one of nature uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave the liquidity free by interest that moves around zero so that in this way the banks buy assets for billing.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to throw some sand into the pipeline, as the ECB has already planned with its annual supply, which will take place next week.
That’s why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox movements and we’re just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The fluctuations of the exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt was rising again.
We now rely on quality and the U.S., Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the Eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain until now was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review down regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who once again tried to generate awareness of what they had caused, as they had removed the devastating effects that the limitation of loans led to the loss of jobs, as they should have actually promised a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that silents the government’s debt, elections, and a new government that pulls on the same thread.
Prodi did it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from the failure to fulfill its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, allowing a euro member country to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the contrary, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with the obligation to take unusual measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of the normalization of the risk premiums, after some doubts on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt rise at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences were reduced and the Spanish increased further, it would be a special Spanish risk.
While the above-mentioned indicators force a large portion of market research institutions to prefer their recovery scenarios and repair their 2011 scenarios, including the OECD and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this promises no long life despite warnings.
Again, it seems like it’s an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it’s required “precaution when driving”.

Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the subcommittee of the Parliament, where in these days the strategy regarding the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades will be debated.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some points of view about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from that date by 2030, with the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this was not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it should no longer be invested in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020 the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to absorb carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prejudice of course by other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, never wanted to say anything against this law, like creating incentives for the national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
According to his opinion, “this direction is clearly set in the long run, despite some “unidentified” assumptions, as Iberdrola’s chairman said.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments should be made right now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to take them into action.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for airports on the ground, the Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service on ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, is for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation with the aim of creating an innovation center for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be the study of energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is struggling to approve its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The City Council wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the Administration for Public-Private Cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to advance the project in accordance with a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the Administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and construction management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounted to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with in the last phase three consortiums, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second with headquarters in Italy, one of the best specialists in deep construction.
The Northern Direct consortium consists of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which has specialized in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatization, but has a obstacle to overcome, as you only get access by purchasing a local construction company.
A strategy that the above-mentioned companies have followed, in addition to Asian references, and that has to be followed by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market by its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of great importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the dissolving industry.
Among other assets, it already has its grown wind wheat park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide deforestation plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate on these two areas and to use these synergies to maintain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The subterranean mouth trail, promoted by the City Infrastructure Office of Brisbane and will be called Northern Link (Nordzubringer), aims to connect the western highway in Toowong with the surrounding trail in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels.
The roadmap issued by the City Administration presents the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction works in December next year.
Although this road is expected to be open for traffic in the last months of 2014, the construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two trails in each direction, an electronic mouth system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is participating in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is ready for a big deal.
Australia has repeatedly awarded significant orders to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government in the amount of 154 million.
ACS will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband with glass fiber cables.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Towers with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounted to €75 million.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million dollars
FCC has through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a highway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the subsidy for the construction work to expand the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine enhances its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising status from Renfe
Renfe has assigned the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mr. Rushmore by an amount of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company.
Mr. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies presented to this competition issued by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, including TBWA, who was responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and making the campaigns.
France Télécom has been sentenced to a fine of more than 63 million dollars for breaking the competition.
The competition regulatory authority in France has imposed a fine of over EUR 63 million to France Telecom for anti-competitive behavior in the Caribbean territories.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed and mobile networks by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the boundary of the regulation.
Along with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have raised more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for disability of their competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased as the competition surveillance authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and therefore has become reversible again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet in order to increase the revenue from transactions that do not come from the telephone connection.
Basically, this application site of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 until this site will be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match in the Champions League has made Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
Since its establishment in 1992, the Champions League has evolved into a source of income for the Fuβball clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, bringing them to the third and fifth place in the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory with it; it is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has allocated up to 5,362,5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since their founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is on the third place in Europe that has earned the most money through its participation and the only one that has won the trophy three times along with the AC Milan.
The executive Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup 1992 is ranked fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also earned the most money by participating in the last Champoins League.
And that, though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only on the third place in the countries that were able to raise money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four bie Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complex fund distribution procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, expects to earn 1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, the UEFA predicts 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualification course (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who struggled to participate received 3.8 million by their simple presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they struggled.
There is also a bonus for wins (800,000 euros) and a disagreement (400,000 per team). The clubs who have arrived in the eighth final will receive three million each; the four who have arrived in the quarterfinals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four will receive 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who gets 5.2 million.
Thus, a Fuβball club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça again earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money will be allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 places allocated.
The last year’s champion receives 40% of the money assigned, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has released details about the purchase offer of shares, with which it intends to acquire a maximum of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which is paid for ten years and with a interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares dropped by 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa ratings the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 counselors.
The Jeréz Group gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to inform their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it was in contact with the authority.
With a graduation, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructuring its management.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial quarters of his former manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal book review.
A decision to make her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created position, which is directly subject to the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free of polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle due to the suspicion of converting more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the credit of the Salazar yesterday the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million, without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusive tender of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusive tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it has been proven that the conditions comply with the applicable laws and thus the content of the declaring reserve submitted, according to the amendments of the last 2 December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV also that this offer is aimed at the purchase of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the company’s capital, consisting of €6.142.786 in shares approved on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
Moreover, it was that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender and whose price was determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the lawful laws.
New Programs for Vehicle Review
In these days of crashes and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are thrown into the workshops, where an assessor has to assess the damages arising and the costs for the repair.
No one accident is the same and calculating the costs for the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between €20,000 and €30,000 per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
In contrast, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and restoration collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are made with their products.
The other two companies that compete with the tool market for review and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is nothing but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it is working with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed is increasing to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come to the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
Once a new car comes to the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because every single of the Eighty Thousand Vehicle Parts must be catalogued and its price is entered.
In addition, each model creates a “intelligent” graphic image on which you can “click” on different parts of the vehicle.
If it’s a much-sold model, the work can be completed within a week if the procedure progresses rapidly.
If it’s a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the car park on the streets, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight distributed centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, however, depending on country, there are also tools for managing rubbish parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs a driver about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
By reviewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily find an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for accident protection for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Depending on the cost of the parts, it includes the manufacturer’s estimated repair times or the packaging prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros a month.
In contrast, every insurance company that makes thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment it was using from the assembly band, only by means of the vehicle number.

Cost forecast of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost forecast in just four steps:the identification of the vehicle, the search for the spare part, the creation and creation of a cost forecast.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the elderly professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database consists of 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 ground cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transports and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the vehicle number, a graph of the model is displayed and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, rewards or discounts, and then he can print the cost forecast and share it with his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop focused does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without delay.
Currently, Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automotive engineers have been waiting for a long time, as you can choose a door, for example, and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
