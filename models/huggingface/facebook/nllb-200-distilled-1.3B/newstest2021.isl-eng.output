A Call to the World
Looks Like You Need Iceland's marketing campaign seems to have gone well, and the wildlife outdoors is starting to attract people from all over the world.
You own the look, I need Iceland, says a woman in the big world in comments to an ad from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on the YouTube content channel.
Another spectator says they will keep Iceland in their heart forever and a young woman says she has to be the first to reach the end of Iceland if her fiancee lives there.
Unfortunately, though, she is in the United States and is expected to wait a few more months.
Another spectator asks if the runway to Iceland is ready, since there are no planes.
It doesn't matter if he's from another time period.
Egill Thórðarson of Peel, who designed the ads with international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been more hopeful.
I found many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, it's about creating a PR value, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have been covered by some 700 media outlets worldwide, reaching a total of over two billion people.
The value of that coverage is estimated at $1.8 billion.
It's not amazing.
The main market of all is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although the Americans are not coming to the country anytime soon.
According to Egil, familiar markets such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also responded well, as has Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then came the response from foreign regions, such as India, which were not particularly concerned.
"These ads have travelled farther than we expected", says Egill, "but that may be why over four million people have seen the content on YouTube.
We couldn't have asked for a better start.
The opening images were taken by Aarni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunbladet, in the middle of last month, when he was taking a commercial with the headline Let It Out.
The events took place in many places, such as during the School Guard Day in Reykjavik, in Reynisfjörður, at Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajökli and in a cave near Hjörleifshöfða.
Directed by Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and shot by Ottar Guðnason.
The roles in the first two films were played by Anna Jia of Iceland and Murphy Cardenas of Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the advertisements, but while recordings were taking place in the southern part of the country, another group was in the western part of the country and in the Westfjords.
According to Egils, Let It Out is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign but is aiming for a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Office, says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
It's great to work with them.
In projects like this, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about.
Bombshell: Discuss the position of the labor market, pension funds, and more
Minister of Social Affairs and Children, Einar Daddasson, will attend the Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. today in Bylgjuna.
He is also Minister for Labour and discusses the situation of the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
It also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs in a country that has been badly affected and controversial in recent years and decades.
The programme will also feature the chairman of the VR, Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, who will discuss his criticisms of pension fund investments and propose that the labour movement and employers withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
They will then be interviewed by Ivar Ingimarsson, a tour operator in Austria, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, the director of the Nordic Marketing Office, about the state of rural tourism.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the summer's success is a false harbinger of things to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10:00.
This is what it looks like today, 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teen shows.
She gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She has been in a bit of a bad mood lately, but she was able to look back and comment on Clueless on Australian television recently.
She spoke beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and said she was a wonderful person.
I must admit, I built my character mostly on girls I met in school who weren't good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was, "Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the station after the nightfall
About 50 cases were reported to the Metropolitan Police today, and the police diary says the cases have been diverse.
The day at the police station on Hverfisstraat began with the police having to deal with a man who had just been released from prison after serving time for a drunken brawl.
The man refused to leave after he was released and disobeyed the police who told him to leave.
The man was sentenced to a continuous period of detention because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a business in Koopavogi.
Police also had to take two men off the streets of Broad Hollow because of a report of assault.
Then, too, a woman who was sitting at a desk in a shopping mall in Copenhagen could not pay the bill at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
There was also a report of a vehicle stolen in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault pickup looked for her for a few minutes and then took her by the hand.
The car has never been found.
The Curse of the Joyful Army - The Horrific Fate of the Joyful Witnesses
The theory has spread so widely on the Internet that the series of The Joy Luck Club has been cursed, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California the day before, becoming the third main character to die prematurely.
Glee is a popular series of musicals, dances, and comedy.
The series was full of so-called high school fun, love, and fate.
The joy of being in the cheerleading squad was not always taken for granted, but through song and dance, the characters seemed to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the studio, the cast and crew have been plagued by disasters, so much so that theories have been raised that the show is cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera was cast as Santana Lopez on the show, a clown who didn't call her grandmother.
After the series ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had their first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to press charges and the domestic violence case was dismissed.
On July 8, Rivero was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Peoria, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had been swimming and that Rivera had rescued him but never returned to the boat himself.
Started an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that the search was based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
It is said that she was caught in a heavy river and used her last breath to save her son.
The cause of death was listed as a drunk driving accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the voice of an angel who was instrumental in bringing the Joy Division to prominence and respect.
Outside the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to break free.
In 2013, his co-stars felt overwhelmed, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and everything seemed to be looking up.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after a night out with friends.
The banamein turned out to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be an act of will.
Moneith had been receiving treatment and his tolerance for drugs had declined so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was a heavy blow to his co-workers, but at the urging of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue shooting the series, dedicating the entire episode to Moneith's memory and his personality.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah Puckman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Division, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child pornography.
A search of his home found a large amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon brought to the public's attention.
It was obvious that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He faced a prison term of four to seven years, as well as having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before a judge could decide on the sentence, Salling, who was then out on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors who fell from the past.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He died of a stroke in his sleep in 2013, aged just 41.
The show also starred a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and had a bad history with her sister, but she accused Roberts of being too controlling and disrespectful.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter for her fiancee, blaming her mother and sister, among other things, for what had happened to her.
My mother and my so-called siblings leave me with nothing but the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression.
Michel Lea was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her actors' nudity and transgression on set and of wearing translucent stars.
Jesse Luken guest starred on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with embezzlement in 2019, which caused a great deal of shock.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the show.
In 2010, she was caught by unwanted computer cameras taking nude photos of her and posting them on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had romantic relationships outside of the show.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
Playing in a garden with parents, growing flowers, and watching them grow and blossom, stimulates children's growth.
There is also endless potential for flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something you never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the scent, and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Buying a boat after 10th grade
I don't think we have many sailors working in the country's kindergartens, says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland in the winter.
Fishing on the beach is a very convenient summer job when you are in school.
If you fish well, you can make a good living, and I feel great about not having to take a loan.
The income is also enough for me in the winter, says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who, like the others, is fishing on the beach this summer.
Axel was newly arrived at the pier in Tálknafird when a reporter caught up with him late in the evening earlier this week.
"By the time I was in the tenth grade, I had taken a pilot's license for boats under 40 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used by my friend, Hartmann Jonsson, and named it after him.
Hartmann had grown up by the time I bought the boat and was no longer at sea, and he was very pleased to see that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat", says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for $3 million.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, $1.5 million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I'd finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of this first summer on it.
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay for a boat when he had just finished primary school?
I had put up and saved myself money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was all fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my holiday money in my boat fund.
Axel was born in Isfahan, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Copenhagen since he was a boy.
I can fish here in the West Bank because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Isfahan.
I studied in this area here west of the Rocks with my dad.
I move between distances as I feel like it, because this fishing area covers the whole of the West Indies.
While I'm more comfortable in the West, I've also bet around Snowdonia and beyond.
I've also given to the sun but I prefer a grass lip, says Axel, who always touches a fire in the morning and says sometimes he talks to the moon and sings to the sky, in the solitude of hours together out on the ballerina.
The Internet is good out at sea, so I can make calls, listen to radio shows and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting caught in a trap, but there have been occasional bad weather, but never a big risk", says Axel, who is lucky that he never gets seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes at any given time.
I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time on the coast, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the quota system, but then I have been out fishing for a day and a half in the open sea.
He says that the coastal system allows him to catch up to 3,000 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he finds discouraging.
Another obstacle is that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish 12 days a month, during the four months when fishing is suspended, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to row instead of having 48 days all summer and being able to choose their own.
So the zoning could also be a good thing and fisheries well situated should be able to enjoy it, says Axel, who mainly draws cod from saltwater on his coastal routes, but also only whales and other unique species.
Axel is working during the winter with his university studies at the Nursery School in Nuup.
"I don't think there are many sailors working in kindergartens in the country", says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I'm sticking with it because I think it's a wonderful job.
I hope that psychology will be useful to me at the kindergarten level in the future", says Axel, who also has a long history in business.
A violation of registration prevented home infection
A mistake in the registration form that people fill out when they enter the country caused a resident of this country not to be called back for a sample.
If the form is completed in English, as it is in Finnish, there is no requirement to register the identification number.
"This will be reviewed this week", says a specialist in the field of occupational medicine.
Three internal infections were detected at the State Hospital's virology department yesterday.
One of the patients tested positive arrived on July 15, two days after the so-called "home-bound" policy took effect.
Those who were residents in Iceland are then discouraged upon arrival and are invited back to the field service four to five days later.
However, the afternoon news reported that the man had followed the old system.
The border test came back negative and he was not recalled for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the field of occupational safety, said in an interview with a news agency that this could be due to a mistake in the electronic registration.
If you fill out the registration form in English, you are not required to enter a number, as is the case with the Finnish version.
Yet, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the subject was not automatically invited to be sampled.
However, Kamilla says many have followed the rules of return even though they filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for a sample after they arrived in the country.
This week will be a week of discussion on how to make it easier for people to access and to raise their awareness of the process.
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed on standby.
They're all going to get tested, but two of them were showing symptoms.
The three infections reported yesterday are currently undergoing infection, but are largely complete due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of Icelandic genetic data has revealed a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In the second case, the bonds have been directed to Israel, even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be clear tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation, according to COVID websites.
135 are on standby.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five cases of domestic transmission have been detected in the country in recent days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and the source of the infection that came out at the Rey Cup athletic meet yesterday has not been identified.
The infection is still rampant.
Originally, the third dozen were sent to the search for a specific target, but this was reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are in quarantine due to the new infection detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that a case of the virus has been detected at a sporting event, raising questions about whether such an event should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications director at the Public Security Department of the Prosecutor General's Office, says that as long as people follow the rules and regulations, it is fine.
We are constantly concerned for all who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual immunity.
We also need to make sure that people who are attending an event know that there are certain rules that must be followed.
Then you can have an event, says John.
He says that you can prevent infection by keeping personal air fresheners.
In addition, rules and standards are constantly being reviewed.
What needs to be done, and what the Public Health Service and the National Health Service are constantly doing for people, is to take care of these individual infections.
Both for home use and for service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the infection from spreading", says John.
 We need to encourage people to continue on the good path we were on, so that we can maintain the progress we have made so far.
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how her father was having trouble breathing.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The patient was diagnosed with sudden respiratory distress due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed as an underlying condition on the death certificate, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that something similar will happen.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not without reason.
A recent study commissioned by the U.S. government shows that nearly 40 percent of those who die had type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those under 65 is examined, the figure rises to half.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says that the findings are striking, especially for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
The drop in slow growth was reflected in a Reuters survey of 12 countries that reported similar rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to identify underlying diseases.
Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now, COVID-19 has broken out like a powerful pandemic, reports Reuters, citing Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American descent, who have also been worse off from the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control by exercising, eating a healthy diet, and seeking the help of health-care professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a weekly routine.
The high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work, thus eliminating exposure to the virus.
Reuters reports that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk posed by the virus to those with type 2 diabetes.
When SARS-CoV-2 broke out in 2003, just over 20% of those with the disease were infected, and during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times more likely to need hospitalization.
When MERS was first discovered in 2012, one study found that 60 percent of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Yale University researcher Charles S. Dela Cruz says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the pandemic has removed the gap of a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear we will see a wave of problems when this is over", says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the World Diabetes Organization.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
New research suggests that the coronavirus may be leading to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in many people with diabetes.
High levels of glucose and lipids in diabetics can trigger a so-called "cell-mediated storm", as the immune system reacts to the body in an overwhelming way.
Damaged visceral cells can also lead to inflammation, which can lead to fatal blood loss.
"It's all one big puzzle", says Dela Cruz.
It's all connected.
The story has been corrected.
They offered us champagne, then they left the room.
At the unusual request of the artist Ragnari Kjartanssyni, couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
We loved each other, so it wasn't complicated.
Atli Bollason will never forget the first time he met his wife and mother, Asrun Magnusdotteri.
I was very fond of her.
It was just the radiation, of course, but then I thought it was also incredibly cute.
And still silent, he says.
As a reminder, the husband also regularly recalls the first meeting.
I keep hearing this story.
"Only last weekend", says the woman who also fell in love with her husband on the first date.
I felt and feel such excitement around Atlas, that I love him.
There's a lot going on and a lot happening, and I loved it.
Atli says that the couple have focused on going their separate ways in their relationship.
We don't tie our bags in the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid the noise we see around us.
That may explain why they received the message from the artist with enthusiasm, though it was unusual to say the least.
Kristin Anna, our mutual friend, contacted us and asked if we could come for dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörga, wife of Ragnars, at Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the three of them at Snaps, and had dessert wine and dessert for each of them.
They obeyed Ragnar, who guided them through his plans for an art exhibition he intended to put up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
He had a multi-colored video called Scenes from Western Culture.
He put it in a simple way.
Asrun says that he described the work as banal and decadent, a relic of everyday life in the West.
He had sketches of all the shows he was going to shoot and finally he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in doing.
The drama Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show a young middle-aged couple making love in a minimalist room.
These are journeys with a beginning and an end, says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar very well, although they knew of him and he of them. But they knew us and felt we were a good fit.
They had a saying that they didn't want to advertise after people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual pleasure from performing for others.
They cheated Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, but it didn't take long.
When we ran out of Snaps, we said, "Isn't this what we're here for?"
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his whole team, says Ásrún and Atli accepts.
It's about love and closeness
Senan was filmed in a nice apartment on Myrrh Street.
There was a very popular film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound engineer and a couple.
After the fire was lit, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Asrun.
We hadn't decided anything about how we should be.
We were given some instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and for whom.
It was not a game, we just loved each other so it was not complicated", says Ásrúna.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic", says Atli and Aśrun agree.
We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a fancy hotel in Paris.
The audience was impressed by the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
When Tommi the carpenter saw this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful, says Atli.
It's as much about love and closeness as it is about the relationships themselves, says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in his son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to mess with it", says Atli.
Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this before, but then my dad texted me and said, "It's nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo",
And did the work deepen the bond between Asura and Atlas?
At least we're still together, so maybe this deepened something.
At least it deepened my relationship with my relatives", says Asrun and laughs.
Asrun himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else", she says, turning to her husband.
But it was fun to see because it's just one late entry in a much bigger work, and when you see it with the other works, it's really cool.
I could sort of pull away from it and just be proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach", says Asrun, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the show was filmed.
It was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with them on Love Stories on the first channel.
Swansea with a win in their first game of the qualifiers
Swansea won 1-0 over Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the first game of the qualifying round for the Premier League.
The match was played at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score was 0-0.
Swansea's home side took the lead in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the bow from the point of the penalty and let the defence go.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, got the red card.
Brentford were outplayed for the rest of the game and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew then added to the scoring with a superb goal, securing Swansea's 1-0 victory.
Swansea are now 1-0 up in the standings, with the second leg to be played next Wednesday at Brentford.
No ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed lifeguard because he feared for his life.
However, the president of the United States has not been able to appoint an ambassador to this country without success.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. ambassador in late April 2009, she has been absent from the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under extraordinary circumstances, but Kastljós stated in 2009 that she should have received the False Word.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President's office saying that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor was appointed in September 2010.
This may be partly because Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador but had resigned.
At the time, Loius Ariega had worked in the Foreign Service for some decades.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and became Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came another era of diplomatic silence.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and was sworn in shortly thereafter, but no ambassador had been in the country for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office, on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington system.
So it took two years for the U.S. Congress to call Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to question him and confirm his termination as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony before the Parliament, he said that he had never been to Iceland but had often been to Western Europe, but that his wife, who is dead, was of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a political appointee, former dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest in the country.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has been appointing people to key positions and that in recent years the work of the US Congress has dragged on for a long time, including confirming ambassadors to the post.
Since 2009, there has been a total of more than five years without an ambassador in Iceland.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy's new headquarters on Engjateig.
The estimated construction cost is $6.5 billion, but the building is surrounded by thick concrete walls and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
However, it seems that this was not enough to satisfy the current ambassador's security concerns, since he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player was racist in Iceland - It was a mistake to come to Iceland
Tonny Mawejje, a former IWF player, says he was subjected to racism while in Iceland and regrets coming to the country.
This is according to an interview with Tony published in the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, a team in the Ugandan Premier League.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland, but he played for ÍBV, Val and Þrótti in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the centre as I used to.
The midfielder was in that position but also had the number of the shirt I wanted so I didn't get anything I wanted", says Tonny, who played on the right wing during the season with IBV.
Among the things Tony talks about is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This happened to me once, but since I did not understand the language, I simply ignored what was being said.
Later, I learned about the case and asked my friend what it was about.
He told me that my opponent had made a racist comment about me after I had taken him out.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He says that he made the mistakes that he sees most in the world.
Tony had not managed to make the first team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway I would have had the opportunity I wanted", says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway he would probably go further.
He means that the loan to Iceland has destroyed his dreams of playing in the big leagues in Europe.
A worm was found in a woman's throat.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a black worm, 12 inches (3.8 cm) long, in the throat of a woman who was searching for it.
The doctor managed to pull the worm out with a thumb.
The investigation revealed that the insects were parasites.
CNN is reporting this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, a thin meat stew.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites on the table are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in the West, the number of cases of parasite infestation has increased, reports CNN.
Fear of a Second Wave in Europe
Spain is currently in the heat of concern about a second wave of coronavirus in Europe, but the government has taken measures to re-start the spread of the coronavirus.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action over the surge in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go into quarantine when returning from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infections are also rising again in France and Germany, as governments try to find a balance between slowing the spread of the virus and reviving the economy.
Europe, however, is doing well compared with the rest of the world, with new infections approaching 300,000 a day worldwide, with the highest numbers in the Americas and South Asia.
The number of confirmed infections worldwide has reached 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the number of confirmed deaths linked to the virus has reached 644,000.
The Mosaic Law of Genesis Finally Fulfilled
In front of the Reykjavik Customs House is a large and deep cave.
Up there are men with orange helmets.
There's a big grave there too.
And more work cars.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is paved, and many people now stand and admire the millions of mosaic tiles as if they had never seen them before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least, it didn't seem that way.
The work has been quite quiet so far, with parking lots right in front of it that were always translated.
People stopped, locked the car, and rushed to their work in the city center.
Beautiful and diverse public spaces and attractive citizens are the guiding lights of the ongoing rebuilding of the Security Guard.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic of Gerda Helgadottir at the Customs House to enjoy the view better.
A square will be laid out in front of the project, and the sunny location makes it a suitable place for travelers to stay.
The artwork will be displayed and will now be more enjoyable than ever on this 42-square-foot [142 sq m] site.
The area also features small tookuudars, a type of water sculpture, which offer play and give the area a certain mystique.
The renovation is being carried out by the City of Reykjavik, which is working with Veitum.
The water, heating and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of these are old, but the School and Cold Water Acts date from 1925 and have served downtown residents and businesses for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened, the construction will be completed and the cars will be able to drive on it again.
But it becomes a one-way street, and soon there is a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
A study on the Customs House on the website of the Customs Director states that the building was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the seawater that penetrated the house, a 250-square-foot windowless wall was formed out of the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a move would have a negative effect on the overall appearance of the building unless special arrangements were made to beautify it.
So the members agreed to have a permanent artwork installed there.
During this time, Gerda Helgadottir, an artist, was widely reported.
She had worked extensively on mosaic cycling projects in Germany and beyond.
The goal was to contact her before deciding whether there would be a competition for the job.
It had often been discussed that the work should reflect the life of the port, since the port had been a vibrant Reykjavik since its creation.
When the artist was interviewed, she had the idea of such a work.
It was arranged that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from abroad, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she felt she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
The decision was made to ask her to do the work.
Also, a full-time contract was sought with her and the famous German art company, the Oidtmann Brothers, with whom Gerhard had long worked on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Agreements were reached, and Gerður worked on the artwork in the brothers' workshop, which was then installed at the Customs House.
The whole work was handled exceptionally well, both by Gerda Helgadottir and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Has it ever since withstood the harsh Icelandic weather?
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was finished and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of the Customs House, aged only 47.
The move of more institutions to the mainland
Social Affairs Minister Einar Asmundsson suggests that more public institutions will be moved to the country in the near future.
That's what a minister said on the show "Blowing Up the Hill" at noon.
It was recently announced that the fire department of the Department of Housing and Human Services will be moved north to Shepherd's Bush in the fall.
Six fire experts work at the agency, but none of them intend to join the agency north, and the National Fire and Ambulance Association has criticized the buffer shipments.
I think we should take this thing one step further.
I'm preparing another step for this creature.
More moves, said Asmund.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more government agencies spread throughout the country.
I think that further political decisions need to be taken on the relocation of public services, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency, said Ásmundur, but he also cited other organisations that have been relocated and have made a big difference to communities abroad, such as the relocation of the Food Authority to Selfoss, the Icelandic Immigration Agency to Akraness and the unemployment insurance on the Skagstrand.
Highlights of the Second Day of the Championships
The 94th Icelandic Athletics Championships ended today at the Thornsveld in Akureyri.
A number of goals were scored on the second day of the race.
There was an exciting competition in the worst women's category at Thorsholm, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH placed the Icelandic team in the worst in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from Ireland added the rating in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record this summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and she didn't get a grip today.
She had only one field goal from five, a throw of 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest throw of the day, or 60.08 meters, on her last attempt and set a course record.
Her previous record of 62.69 meters set in July was still far from it.
Gudrúnas Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir of Ireland had the second-best throw of the day, but she improved her best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the Finnish national team's Helmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder, won the most consecutive, safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his second-to-last throw and set a meet record.
His personal best in the event is 75.26 meters.
Gudni Valur Guðnason, Olympic champion and Icelandic record holder in the long jump, won a competition in the long jump at the Thornsveld yesterday but today he competed in the long jump, which is his main sport.
The Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest throw of 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today but he had one yellow throw that went into second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic long-distance record holder, won the long jump with a jump, but Hafdís jumped 6.25 metres today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200 metres, the Irishman Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jona was the winner at Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100m and 4x100m relay and then also in the 4x400m relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Mána Samúelssyni from Ármanni.
Like Godbjörg Jonah, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Not getting a fine for a $27 million Bitcoin tax.
The IRS has rejected a tax investigator's request for a fine for misrepresenting his income from the sale of Bitcoin.
The Committee concludes that the tax inspector did not provide a clear reason for the fine.
The Commission's decision states that the tax inspector considered that the man had misrepresented material errors in his tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.
He would have miscalculated his $27 million in cash from the sale of the Bitcoin coin, either intentionally or through gross negligence.
Fine the man for his behavior.
The man wrote to the committee, denying it.
However, he admitted to having sold $27 million worth of electricity in 2016.
He would have had her by graft in 2009 and 2010, when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax benefits of such sales were very vague and unpredictable.
At best, it would have been expected that ordinary citizens would be aware of such tax provisions.
He would not have intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and would have listed his assets on a deposit account.
He would have consulted both the miners and the tax collector about how this would be done, but to no avail.
He then felt it necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to learn about complex rules that the tax authorities had not formulated.
The man was right to expect that his taxes for those two years of income would be re-established and charged, but otherwise no penalty would be imposed.
He then insisted that he was a resident of Iceland and had paid taxes in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his responsibilities in a disobedient way.
The demand for guilt would be too much for him to bear and would drive him into debt.
Brown dust makes a name for himself: This man knows what football is
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a popular figure among the public but has also attracted attention for his progress in the Pepsi Max League.
Blick will be in the line of fire tonight when they take on IA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brown then takes the game out of bounds for four caution spots during the season and does not return to the game with a new cut as he has done in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his forehead for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don't know who exactly he was answering the payment to, but in terms of character, this one was better at trying.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone to level the game, I thought he would do it or make it", said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when the number was against Brynjólfi.
I'm supposed to be here for the people.
It is sometimes difficult to appreciate his situation.
He looks a little to the left when it comes to the game, but he has a very free roll in the team", said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real fun person and is happy to have such a colorful man in the department: No one disputes that this is character.
He's a funny guy and I love that about his hair, and being always ready to come and answer interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people interested in him, which tells me this guy knows what football is.
I'm a fun guy.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.
People are reading the interview with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what's next on his hair.
"This man is just a genius", said Manny.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - I have been in contact with several teams in the B-League
Tobias Thomsen, KR's Pepsi Max League player, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season at home, but to do so he must first terminate his contract with KR as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me great understanding, Tobias told Bold.
I've been in contact with several teams in the B-League and will probably switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
There aren't many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR.
Then he says he will probably have to accept a pay cut in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have probably felt more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.
Bjartmar has renamed bicycles for millions - now answers for himself after coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest unlike most others.
He searches and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and handbags.
Has Bjartmar earned himself the name "the bicycle-factor" for the weekend?
Yesterday, a lot of hype erupted when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV pointed them to a discussion on the Facebook group of Western Towns where it was reported that Bjartmar had taken the man to a number in the Eastern Township and said the vespuna may have been stolen.
The only thing that could be read from the original handwriting of the electrician was that Bjartmar had stolen it.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the original news report has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case does not at all reflect what really happened yesterday in the Eastern Plain.
Bjartmar said he had received information from a victim of an electrical shootout that these were indeed his electrical shoots.
The information was obtained by the alleged owner from another person, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
I looked for the guy and I checked the shuttle, ended up with information that there was an electrical outlet that had been missing for a very long time and was being searched.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to leave on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was convinced of his fault, so I decided to talk to the man.
I usually handle such matters very well, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter offered to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, great", said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight".
Then the owner of the electric scooter began to prove his ownership of his electric scooter and set off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electrical outlet shared his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
During the past year of his practice, Bjartmar says he can count the changes he makes on the edge of people on the fingers of his other hand.
I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík, said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the least of society's brothers and sisters, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
The drug is a hard master and somehow you have to finance the next dose, because unfortunately, stealing such cash is an easy way to that end, says Bjartmar.
My relationship with these people is actually so good that I have brought many of these good people with me.
Examples are people who have gone to therapy and looked after me and then came to me and helped me with what I am doing", he says.
Generally, Bjartmars' interactions with cyclists are on a courtesy note.
Some people know about him and what he is doing, and they offer to show him peacefully receipts, license plates, and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even starting to tell people to talk to him from stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is not happy with the previous report of DV and says that he is not some self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet reached a high point with his activities, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that certainly is.
Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is the police are clearly not doing this.
I have to watch the cops drive away from a big pile of stolen bikes.
She is quite the witless one in these matters.
"When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this class of cases, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has been so successful in riding a wheelchair that sometimes he runs into his "skid steers" on the street who just have the Bjartere bikes they had previously reached.
The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance, she has clearly not come.
It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bikes' fault, said Bjartmar and regretted that the victims of the bicycle theft have to suffer from the police's negligence in this case.
There is no question about the success of Bjartmar.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmari for returning their possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are of course in the millions, if not millions.
Electrical wires, bicycles, and electrical enclosures are heavy, but an electric bicycle can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works at the kindergarten all day and every other weekend he works at the dormitory.
His bicycle is therefore an unpaid job that he does in his spare time.
Pensions and Long Shadows
2019 was a big anniversary in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had been receiving pensions from the King of Denmark since the 19th century, but in 1919 a civil servants' pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid by the Universal Labour Market Framework Agreements in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with a compulsory section and a statutory fundraising scheme from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 laws were passed on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to evolve.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the 20th-century labor movement pushed through with its struggle for power.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly cut in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions were also gradually getting their claims for sickness benefits, substantial leave entitlements, reduced working hours, housing reforms, and other things that made a difference.
All these rights were fought for with great effort, but in the end they proved to be far more durable than the increase in wages, which, as many remember, disappeared in the wake of the postwar inflation that characterized the period up to 1990.
The process of creating the universal pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the men eventually agreed that the funds would be in effect the property of the foundations, the workers' movement agreed that their boards should be made up of representatives of employers and foundations alike.
In the years following the creation of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the boards of the funds was often discussed by the employee organisations, but never came to fruition, and so we are still left with the unusual arrangement that the representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the operation of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in paragraph 1 that the pension fund shall have the interests of the members as its guiding light.
Section 5 also states: Pension funds shall set ethical standards for investment.
The shareholder policy of the Merchants' Pension Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in continuation of the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN) Responsible Investment Principles (RIPs), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Hemisphere and Europe.
The rules discuss how a focus on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to better investment-friendly portfolio management.
This brings together the interests of investors and the aims of society in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, set a public policy on: good governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi pension fund, one of the largest in the country, has a "Policy on Responsible Investment" and similar provisions.
This is all reflected here as an introduction to the latest trendy word in Icelandic, shadow management.
Since the term is new to the subject, I do not expect it to have been defined as a shadow, but it seems to me that the following definition is now most common: shadow management is when a head of a state company says in the media that he intends to send a recommendation or order to the members of the board of a pension fund on how to take a position on a particular matter.
If they fail to follow the instructions, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about the dismissal, then it is not "shadow management" because of course such interactions between people are always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll leave the reader to decide which way he thinks is more appropriate.
There are two people in particular who have been trying to formulate this definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hrør Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of the Central Bank.
The two's appointment came after Icelandair's CEO Bogi Nils Bogason announced his intention to terminate the airline's contracts with air freight and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Merchants Association, issued a recommendation to the company's representatives on the board of the Merchants Lifetime Insurance Fund not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, or risk being left behind.
Some time later, the Nile King withdrew his decision, and Ragnar the Great followed suit with his suggestions, which, of course, were directed to God's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason for Hurd and Asgeir to discuss the matter in the Friday edition of the Fréttablaða newspaper, with big words about shadow government, crime and the urgent need for legal reform.
There, a small shoe would certainly have to roll over a heavy load, even if the blessed shoe was in contact and also soon dried out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the subject at the end.
I have already mentioned the provisions of the Pension Fund Act which relate to this matter.
It states that the board of directors must look after the interests of the members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are detailed in the agreements of both the Guild and the Trader Pension Fund as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term returns on their investments.
Such a policy would be extremely dangerous, and we need not look far for examples of such in the past, when large loans from banks and funds have been used to exploit immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous results.
The Icelandair CEO was clearly on the verge of losing his job when he considered laying off a whole team of employees, thus significantly reducing the company's popularity in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he took it back.
Time will tell whether an investment in a pension fund in the company can be considered a liability to the pension funds once it is established.

One of the infected did not return home
One of the three COVID-19 cases in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic States on July 15, last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not a permanent resident and was not given clear instructions to keep the so-called "home inspection" after arriving in the country and to have another sample taken a few days after arrival.
He tested negative for a border skimmer.
But he is in the Icelandic community and is actually supposed to go to that resort, says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of emergency medicine at Landlækna and a substitute emergency physician while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
He used the English registration form and there is no need to register the registration number and if the registration number is not registered you are not automatically invited to the next sample.
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually lives abroad, but because of his connection in the country, as an Icelander, he would have preferred to use the Icelandic one.
He didn't realize it.
If the number of codes is not recorded, you will have to come to the second sample to find it yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to realize that this was the right way to go", says Kamilla.
Thus, it is clear that we need to promote the information gifts on this subject while we find some way to automate the preaching system even though Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system, she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person concerned is not concerned about coming to the country even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, remaining an Icelander.
Only six have been sent to quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six of those six were in contact with him.
They are expected to be tested, but two of them have started showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man tested negative at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he was probably newly infected with the virus that she couldn't yet diagnose when the sample was taken at the border.
However, the Commission does not rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not bring the virus with him to the country.
It's not entirely possible to say that this is definitely an introduced infection because it's been so long since he came to this country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused some trouble in connection with the sport.
She says that is highly unlikely, however, because of the lack of human activity here.
It is in fact very unlikely says Kamilla but notes that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has isolated the virus in the human.
If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain he brought it into the country.
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and unarmed grenades, while protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racism were protested across the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of the Portland, Oregon, protests.
In Austin, Texas, a protestor was shot to death.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protest.
A mob then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
The police then declared the demonstration to be unlawful and clashes broke out between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and were escorted to closed street rallies where police separated the group from a crowd of protesters who also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorated James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Not the game that defines our era
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United's manager, doesn't want to overstate the importance of today's Premier League final against Leicester.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea don't lose to Wolves, Solskjaer and his men will finish fifth and lose their Champions League spot.
But they should still hope to reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We're not at the end of the line.
If we score against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season", Solskjær said.
But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot to do to catch the two teams ahead of us, said Solskjær.
Clearly, people's nerves are going to be running low at 3:00 today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend it was any other game.
If you want to be a Manchester United player, you have to get used to being under pressure on the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is built on.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is our turn to seize it", Solskjær said.
It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don't define our era, we've already had many moments to define this era.
The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season, said Solskjær.
65,000 infections in a sunny day
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the Western Ocean since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days before that, the death toll from the virus was more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the death toll from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15.
Fear of a Second Wave
The Spanish government is now trying with little success to contain the increased spread of COVID19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID19, both on Thursday and Friday.
The latest confirmed case in the country since early May comes as Spain begins to lift one of Europe's strictest travel restrictions.
The backlash led the British authorities to now require passengers arriving from Spain to go on a return journey.
A week ago, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where the government has taken more restrictive measures to try to control the rate of interest.
In the capital city of Barcelona, nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and senior citizens' homes will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in place for 200,000 people in the province of Segria in western Catalonia.
The UK's decision is expected to have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign tourist arrivals and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights scheduled today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are reportedly preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but little interest seems to be shown in re-entering a massive travel ban that has devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been very critical of such a policy, likening it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, said that the nation "could not survive, economically or socially", if a nationwide travel ban were re-imposed.
Many officials hope that local measures that reach the population of individual towns, cities, or regions will be enough to contain the next wave of the virus if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - three in the country
Three cases were detected in the country yesterday, and two more at the border.
Thus, five persons with positive COVID-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
A public health official said one of the infections is related to one reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football game.
Has he been sent to solitary confinement and 16 others who were in close contact with him have been in custody?
The infected person was a member of a Reykjavik sports club and, according to the report, only part of the team is in the hospital.
Others sent to the scene have a different relationship with the man.
The source of this infection is unknown and the infection is in full swing at the state police infection team.
The organizers of the ReyCUP event have followed the guidelines and rules of occupational medicine and public safety that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of yesterday's game drew attention, as people could be seen celebrating their team's good team in a very close-knit group outside the stadium.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says, "Parents, please respect the rules that allow contestants to bring their own equipment to school".
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it's related to the one that was detected the day before.
The announcement says: An Icelandic genetic team has isolated the infection and identified a new strain of virus that has not been identified here before.
The case is also being investigated and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case in question is a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
The one in solitary and six people who were in close contact with him in the search.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and the results of further studies such as the engineering of border crossings are pending.
Finally, the announcement states: "The Public Safety Department of the State Police and the State Medical Service urge people to exercise caution and to take personal infection prevention into account.
In the event of a doubt as to whether symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to undergo a sample at the next health centre.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite booked for a businessman's weekend - direct visitors else
The campground at Patrex Firth is fully booked for the weekend, according to a Western District news release.
Guests are advised to consider other options.
He mentions the West Village Bildual, Tálknafjörd, Melanes on Red Sand, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the station.
There is a lot to do in Patreksfjord this weekend, as last year Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the number of people in the campsite, we can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather does not put a strain on the numbers, as DV said earlier today from a diffuse forecast.
Expect the worst weather to the south, though, and expect Patrex fires.
The BBC first reported that all other places in the town were already booked.
Whole apartment buildings falling down in the best spot in the city
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 1820.
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking building permits for renovation, but their business has been floundering in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods in the city of Reykjavik, a three-story apartment building stands tall.
On the ground floor of the building, there is about 2,000 square feet [600 sq m] of retail space.
Behind the house are two staircases, each of which houses four rather large apartments.
They range in size from about 3,000 to 1,300 square feet [93 to 1,300 m2], though most are over 100 square feet [100 m2].
The house has a lot of history to tell.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, the video store, the Forestry Department, the Dairy Trade Dairy Shop, the Joe Gun Factory, the fish market and now the University Press.
The house has, so far as weight is concerned, remembered its foolish beauty.
The house is now in a state of serious disrepair, as shown in the accompanying photographs.
The owner of this house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went to the Borgunar ownership group and was a defender of the Borgunar ownership association.
Among the owners of Borgunar Holding Company is Steelschiff ehf.
Steelschip ehf. is an investment company of Goddess Saint Laurence and her children.
Gudrún also owns a third of D18 ehf.
Gudrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once built the steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has had little to no maintenance since then.
Neighbors say that the house has steadily deteriorated since then, though mostly in recent years.
On the neighborhood's Facebook page, one resident says the house has not been particularly lively in the past year.
This may be because the owners have been looking for years to change the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been in good shape in a while.
It's about time we did something about this stain and it's boring that it's dragged on like this.
He also says he's angry at the owners for not putting in the effort to finish this, find some common ground with the neighbors and stop this "legal" thing.
Do this only in consultation with the community so that we can go ahead and get it done.
The legal step the resident refers to is the planning process of the raid which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a second floor above the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator and a one-story addition, as well as a basement.
The building permit for this project was referred to the Environmental and Resources Adjudication Committee, which annulled it on the grounds that the project did not have a sub-plan and that the boundary survey was not satisfactory.
Reykjavík City then started with a subdivision planning project and finished it with an advertisement in the Official Gazette in July last year.
That arrangement was also frowned upon and the Committee repealed it in March 2020.
By this time, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners were in the process of starting work.
By this time, the house had fallen down considerably, and the neighbors were getting tired.
When the newspaper asked the neighbors about the situation and their reaction, the answers were mixed.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not.
Some directed their anger at the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily out to anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a pile of rubble, but neighbors have a new unused Dunhaga 1820 under their vehicles.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said, tired of the administration:
The fact that we have to go through this three times is absolutely incredible.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read.
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memorial to the stages of city administration and the noble plans of the owner and the years of work of those now in the early stages.
When the reporter was driving to the park on 18 Dunhaga, he was met by a door that was slammed and a garbage can.
Playstation computers and a new television set were among the second trash on earth  victims of the Icelandic summer flood.
The door was open into the old University Press office and there were numerous cats of the hill-country to judge.
Clearly, someone's been lurking in one corner, but no one's in sight.
Stacks of sofas and beds and several sheets of geography pages, which were probably intended to be a book, were blown away.
The stairs to the apartment building were open and lively.
One reporter was lucky enough to run into a resident of one of them.
There were Romanians planting potatoes for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the employee-owned Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, and DV military sources say the company paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
The condition of the house makes it unnecessary to collect rent.
Judging by the post office in front of the house, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have been living there in recent decades.
The railway industry has not been able to cope with the Covid-19 situation, the end of the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction industry and these two industries are the most suitable to use the railway services.
Nevertheless, the homeowners of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the workers and field workers in the community were hanging on by the fire after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a reporter asked the boys about Romanian, the coldness suddenly became clear: In the best part of Reykjavík, a 1,500-square-foot [1,500 m2] building is lying flat.
The owners want to renovate the house and the neighbors want to improve the condition but they disagree on the definition of "repair".
In between, the city's planning department is at a crossroads, the victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process and the stage-by-stage decision of the Environment and Resources Selection Committee.
The house is occupied by Romanian workers, perhaps the very ones who will be helping to improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate £10 million to the campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food ads, after he became seriously ill, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is expected to launch the Better Health campaign tomorrow, Monday, which will encourage doctors to recommend cycling for their overweight patients and will also address the rise in cycling days.
In that case, the TV commercials for fast food will be banned until 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
COVID19 has brought us to the attention of the short and long term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods, a government spokesperson said.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was placed in intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus this spring, and it is partly his weight that is thought to have made him so seriously ill.
Women Are Better Prepared to Lead Change
She said that the new constitution was the greatest step the nation could take toward greater accountability, transparency, and fighting corruption and for the common good.
 We need to shift gears a little bit now and who is better suited to lead such change than the group of people who are more likely to be in these values.
"There are women", said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their femininity.
Standing together and being together to lead change.
So now it's just up to us to lead these changes.
She said she was a little alarmed by the emphasis on Iceland as best in the world in both gender and human rights.
Then we're not as prepared to consider what needs to be done.
Like the Germans are very aware of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot of it.
We have to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the rhetoric of the right-wing groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here, said Helga.
She said that women are in many ways in good hands in Iceland, but added that as elsewhere, the building of Icelanders with very masculine values.
She said that politics was about creating self-interest, authority, and power that were the forces that perpetuated injustice in all societies.
Women have now formed this group and come together and have only become a little annoyed that the Althing is going to look past this 2012 referendum step by step, she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking about.
She said that the EU was committed to the protection of human rights and the environment, cooperation and that we were all really on the same page, adding that these values were fundamental to the new constitution.
We are a country very rich in natural resources and it is ridiculous that people here live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently", said Helga.
It is absurd that it is a natural law that women's jobs are always underpaid.
It is ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses should have to fight endlessly just to get decent pay.
The list of signatories to the new constitution can be signed here via e-Iceland.
Tried to kidnap a pedestrian in the middle of town
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to extort money from them.
Police also stopped drug production in Árbæ, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
Then police stopped a motorcycle driver in the Hlídní, where the driver was traveling at a speed of 146 km/h, which is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his driver's license.
The police in the capital had enough to do overnight and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from 5 yesterday to 5 this morning.
There was a lot of noise at that time because of the noise.
The following Saturday, 11 noisy collisions were reported and were widely reported in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 police complaints were filed.
Six were held in a holding cell last night.
In the city of Riverside, police were called in late at night when airstrikes began.
However, they had already avoided the police officers when they went to the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunk driving and/or drug use.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city center last night, but one of them was kept in a cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West Village.
One was taken to the emergency room after he was injured jumping off a trampoline in Copenhagen.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was pulling a bicycle hood on the Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police diary, the bicycle's equipment was in "very bad condition" and was parked.
You can stay at Monet's house on business weekends
The house where the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his career is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free night in the house is on the salesman's weekend.
The house is small and cramped, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, they have to rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb, it's next open in a week, on Sunday, the day of the businessman's weekend, so it might be a good idea for some holiday shoppers to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a businessman's weekend cost only $964 (U.S.) or just over $200,000 (U.S.) depending on when the next issue comes out.
Dozens are in distress, and some are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days, and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been evacuated as a result, and some are showing symptoms of the disease.
Three people were found to have the coronavirus on the mainland yesterday and two at border crossings.
A specialist at the National Health Service says that the increasing number of infections in the country does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
It's been isolated from the last domestic outbreak and it's a virus that hasn't been seen here before so we have no particular reason to believe that it's been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that is new to the country but of course we need to be very careful now", said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in the field of occupational safety of the country's medical office.
Most of the cases have been in contact with people who came from abroad.
More tests will be conducted shortly, but some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
Now that there is no flu and no other respiratory diseases, we can be quite liberal in doing this test on people who at the time of the flu would have felt the need to do something else first, Kamilla said.
The infection is largely gone, but more people may need to be evacuated.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
Has it raised questions about the wisdom of holding such events?
The Public Safety Communications Director says it very quietly as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible that the infected were infected at the sporting events.
If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after being surrounded by them at these sporting events, then we can say that our campaigns at the events have worked.
But it has not been proven", Kamilla said.
The work of the Department of Public Safety is under constant review.
We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate, Kamilla said.
In just over a week, the mass evacuation will be up to 1,000 people.
This new location could affect the flow.
Defined meditation on cooking - See also Elisha's Table
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a professional soccer player and plays with Val.
She also has a master's degree in nutrition, is a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She uses a lot of energy to get through the day and often spends time cooking good, nutritious meals.
"My normal day starts with an eight-hour shift", says Elisa.
After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before picking up my daughter from kindergarten at about 3:00.
Elisa is very happy to pick up her daughter early for kindergarten.
It's good to spend time with her before I go to practice the second half.
After a workout, it's good to come home and just have to heat up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our minds.
Elisha does not follow a particular diet.
She is finishing her master's degree in nutrition and therefore knows what to eat so that she has enough energy for work, school, family, and exercise.
What I do well is to eat a variety of foods that are well-balanced with protein, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food, not to classify food as good or bad, but as nutritious or nutritionally deficient.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
I find it very thought-provoking to stand in the kitchen cooking and get very involved.
I must say, I have confidence in the kitchen and I believe deeply that I am a good cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, left in the milk of a cow overnight.
So top this meal with whatever's available at any time.
Usually it's banana and jellyfish & coffee.
I'm a big coffee woman.
Environment: Incredibly diverse, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, plain banana and nutmeg, bread with a side dish, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often order all kinds of delicious salad from what's in the fridge, pork or beef, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I'm working with.
If the plan goes completely wrong (which happens often) the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, don't put any more on you.
Environment: Get me something low in carbohydrates for exercise, a loaf of bread with gravy, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
Authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of emergency following mass protests in the city center.
Police yesterday used explosives and pipe bombs to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over, and spread over several blocks near the city's parliament building.
Police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into a riot that took place at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters have attacked police with rocks, bottles, rocket-propelled grenades and other loose material, and one police officer was taken to hospital where he was treated for his injuries.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was intended to show solidarity with the protestors in Portland, Oregon, but the city has been plagued by violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed local police.
There, as in many cities across the United States, people gather under the banner Black Lives Matter, commemorating Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and calling for it to be rectified.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It is not yet known whether the cancellations of Icelandair's flight-free service, which are due to take effect at the next monthly meeting, will be withdrawn.
The electronic vote on the Icelandic Aviation Freedom Association's key agreement on behalf of Icelandair's air freedom will close tomorrow afternoon.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the outcome of the vote is known.
"It's all very well", says Guðlaug Líney.
No cancellations have been withdrawn, this must be done in advance so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will have a job after the end of their period.
The vote is on a contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
The agreement is expected to last until the end of September 2025, and builds on a previously voted agreement on freedom of movement.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Aviation Freedom Association approved a general strike at Icelandair, which was approved by the members in a vote.
It never came, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the Air Freight Association, to resign all its air freight and to seek contracts with another airline.
The pilots were then temporarily assigned to the flight crew.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say.
People are upset by Icelandair's actions, when all its airline passes were cancelled and it was announced that it would be merged with another airline.
Now we're seeing if it's having an impact", she says.
940 freighters were operating at Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, had been cancelled.
The period for dismissal is a short one, three months for those with a short work experience, ending at the July-August meeting.
They account for about 90% of Icelandair's flight frequency.
What if the contract is not approved?
We would like to continue our dialogue with our colleagues.
With this contract, we are meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is denied, it is clear that the free flight has gone too far.
The vote on the nuclear deal is over and Icelandair announces the settlement of the second quarter tomorrow.
The vote on the new nuclear deal will end at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but recent financial results suggest that the company's revenue has fallen by about 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the Icelandair Air Freedom Association and the Icelandair Business Association's agreement started on Wednesday, July 22 and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
The contract is open to Icelandair employees who pay a membership fee to the Air Freedom Society.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new core agreement the following Sunday night, 19 July, although on the previous Friday Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the association after the previous agreement was overturned by the air freight forwarders in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had then resigned all its flights and crew on Friday but these were withdrawn after a new core agreement was signed.
Under the new agreement, air freighters must fly five more hours a month for the same basic pay.
The nuclear agreement, which runs until 2025, includes provisions for pilots and flight crew to fly on one watch.
The agreement was announced to the FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, and many airline customers were reportedly dissatisfied with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's second quarter results will be published tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating income before capital and taxes, is negative at USD 100 to 110 million, or approximately ISK 15 billion, according to the latest export results.
Icelandair sent its emergency accounts to the Court of Auditors last Wednesday, saying that the company's revenue for the quarter was about $60 million, or about $1.7 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $154 million at the end of the quarter, or approximately $1.7 billion.
Icelandair also intends to offer the share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to complete the agreements with the 15 lenders, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before the IPO.
A new strain rather than a new strain
A new virus simply means that this person has come from abroad.
This is not something that has been happening in our country", says Már Kristjánsson, chief medical officer at the Infectious Diseases Department of the National Hospital, about the reports that a new type of virus has been detected in the country.
Three cases were detected in the country yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had been involved in a sports club social activity at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the contagion is still ongoing.
The infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July and two people who came into contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then yesterday an infection was detected related to an infection that was detected the day before and after a sequence analysis by the Icelandic Genetic Research Institute revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.
Infection is terminated in connection with that infection.
Mar notes that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread worldwide, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to speak of a new variant of that virus than of a new strain.
Asked what this means and whether it could indicate that another wave of the pandemic has begun, Már says that it is a case in point and that it could be nothing more.
However, if there are domestic cases that are not linked to abroad and have the same heritage as this particular variant, then the conclusion [on a second wave] could be drawn, but it is not timely to support this, explains Már.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret of Icelandic happiness in hot pots?
BBC reporters are leading the way in an entertaining video that sheds light on the country's swimming and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal is the basis, but so is the tradition of sunbathing.
While children's swimming lessons were legalized in 1940, older citizens are still able to use hot water for their health.
Swimming is described as a fundamental part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of rank or position.
Apart from cell phones, people gather on private notes to discuss home and space or to tap into the power of water: thoughts and batteries for the soul and body.
On the bratton to apply for a hundred days in the election
There are 100 days until the American people go to the polls to elect a president for another four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he's still running.
Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has a big lead over Trump nationally, according to the polls.
According to a recent AP poll, a record number of Americans believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unfavorable, and more Americans than before believe the president has been bad on economic issues.
In particular, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he's been good on the economy.
In March, it was 56 percent; in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's national approval rating is 49.9 percent, while Trump's is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance on the pandemic to Biden, pushing so-called culture wars and promoting policies that aim to turn to law and order.
However, Biden's campaign is racing to keep the spotlight on Trump and has a high chance of winning the election if the election is really about how Trump has performed in office over the past four years.
Trump's misfortune also seems to be coming down on Republican lawmakers, and Democrats fear that Democrats could even win a majority in the US Senate, which has so far seemed very close.
Politico reported that the party and candidate ratings are now on par with the Republican Party's worst showing in decades.
The outlook for the party was particularly poor in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like that trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to scare suburbs to follow suit, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburbs of America and foment racial tensions.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a Barack Obama-era White House policy designed to increase suburb diversity.
He then encouraged the "housekeeper" of the US suburbs to read an article by the former New York deputy governor, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the US suburbs and took Trump under his wing.
Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better! said the President.
The suburban population of the United States is an ever-growing voter group.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the candidate with the most votes in this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney won the majority of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a slim majority in the 2016 election, his following there has been significantly reduced.
While it varies between states, Biden has recommended a 15 percent lead over Trump in recent recruiting.
Regis Philbin is dead.
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin's career as an actor, producer, presenter and singer spanned six decades.
He is best known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has since hosted shows including Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent the most hours on American television and has been recognized for this.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated 37 times in total.
A statement from his family says Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After a final decision was made to postpone the Olympics, an event that has so far been prevented only by world wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now facing together.
Africans have another year to prepare, and Japanese authorities are paying the cost of the delay.
But everyone's got their heads in the sand.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would host the Olympic Games this year, the enthusiasm of the Japanese delegates was undeniable.
They cried and laughed in exchange, and Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games but lost the bid to Rio, Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan were to be the focus of world attention.
The Games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year, starting on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If we can't hold the games, if the coronavirus becomes too much of a threat, then the games will be cancelled.
But no one wants to think about it.
The Olympics are no ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is to be spared, the show must always be magnificent and aim to top the last games.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's score of the cities' nominations.
The more spectacular the presentation, the more likely it is to get the nod.
Tokyo spent $150 million to try to host the 2016 Olympics, or a whopping $1.4 billion.
The last time, when the 2020 games were being held, $75 million was put into the promotion.
In 2013, when the decision was made to host the Games in Tokyo, the Japanese government had already spent some $1.3 billion on the project.
But that is a small price to pay for the construction of an Olympic Village, a stadium, and the general infrastructure needed to host, prepare, and host the Games.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were scheduled to take place today but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by the National Audit Office of Japan published late last year found that the cost was nearly double that.
The cost of postponing the Games is unlikely to be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between $2 billion and $6 billion in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could thus run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic government could only cover almost half of the Olympics, given the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are events of such magnitude that they have quickly become the subject of debate among economists, who try to dig into the numbers and examine the benefits and harms of the games.
At the very least, many seem to have concluded that the Olympics are less than a positive economic influence on the host cities.
Short-term effects are some, such as a huge increase in jobs for a short time, but in the long term cities are happy to sit on the debt and the high operating costs of low manpower.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is in debt for the 2016 Olympics and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the large sports facilities built for the Games.
A post-London 2012 survey found that only 10 percent of those hired for the city's Olympic Games were previously unemployed.
This means that there was little new employment.
Cities have generally not benefited financially from hosting the Olympics because of the high cost of manpower.
However, the benefits are widely seen in the increased tourist traffic that wants to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is, however, highly uncertain regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether the usual crowd will be able to be accommodated.
The main issue, however, is the honor that cities are expected to receive, but it is difficult to measure in terms of money.
For all the expense involved, the joy of gambling is not something to be overlooked.
But while the exhibition is certainly important and there is no money to be saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some Africans, postponing the games is simply a welcome surprise.
For example, Australian pentathlete and Olympic gold medalist Chloe Esposito is a cassock and would have been far from a good player this summer but hopes to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
So she is one of those athletes who is simply more content with the delay, and understandably so.
For athletes who planned to retire after the Games this year, if held on time, postponing the Games in some cases means that they will withdraw before the Games take place.
Just don't rely on your body to go through years of additional rigorous exercise.
Few athletes were as well known to the spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as five-time Olympic champion Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds and a bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to compete in the 2021 Olympics, but she is not sure if she will be able to stay on top of the Games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although not generally considered a great age, it is a high point for a top-ranked female fiddler.
It's a sensitive subject says Biles, but smiles in another interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she plans to reach the same length of time at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll be on top in a whole year of training", says Biles.
She has previously said that her body can no longer handle the stress of weight training.
However, she is training to compete at the 2021 Summer Olympics.
Biles admits that it was a painful feeling to have to stop training suddenly when the pandemic was at its height and the gym was closed.
Biles was not exempt from the seven-week lockdown.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access to the others, she had to find various ways to keep fit like others.
The basic form is certainly better than most people.
We have a tight schedule right now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'll be stepping up my practice steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be played or whether they will be held, but we still practice for them, and we cannot help it.
I've put too much effort into myself to quit the sport now", says Biles.
She, like many others, is blind to the possibility that the Games will not be held in 2021.
But it is hopeless to predict.
No one can know what the state of the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held in a year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid corridor.
A Wedding Postponed by the Plague
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
I think there are other more important things to think about right now, the actress told People.
 We definitely want to get married someday and have that dream wedding and have everyone we love present.
But we decided to put that off and focus on what's really important right now, which is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more into worldly affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There is a lot going on and we should pay attention to what is happening in the world.
