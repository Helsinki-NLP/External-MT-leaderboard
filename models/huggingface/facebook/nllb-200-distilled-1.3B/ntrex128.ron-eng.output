Members of the National Assembly for Wales are concerned that they could be seen as "puppet"
Several members of the National Assembly for Wales are dismayed that they have been suggested to change their title to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly for Wales on the political scene fear that this will cause ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the National Assembly for Wales is concerned that it rymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means obtuz and pwp means fecal matter.
A member of the Welsh Party in the National Assembly for Wales stated that overall the group was "not thrilled" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party stated that the group has an "open" attitude towards the name change, but that he also noted that MWP resembles Muppet.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced in Wales the same as the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, stated: The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly be up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the option to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly for Wales, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament for Wales or WMP, but MWP received the most votes in the public consultation.
Members of the National Assembly for Wales have apparently suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could be a headache for Elin Jones, chair of the steering committee, who is expected to send the bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the final say on their titles when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the naming of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is only a compromise that will allow it to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Episcopal Church have stopped ringing as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem.
"Historically, local veterans I spoke to told me that before, you could find a bar and a church on every street corner", Adams said.
Today, there are no more bars and no more churches.
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently nowadays", he said.
Bars no longer serve as living rooms for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.
And as for the churches, he is worried that the money from the sale of the goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect and that, sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condos full of people who will not support the neighborhood's remaining shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "therefore, this will accelerate the closure of churches, because many of the people who move into these condos are unlikely to become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people  St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who had religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African Americans, led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 badly damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
The Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's Church, called the carillon the "bells of the poor people".
The expert who put the carillon into operation in July described it differently: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the world's first carillon played by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What's been coming from St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story, one that has involved architects and contractors, some brought in by the deacons of the church, some by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, consisting of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese was somehow seeking to pass on costs to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy trying to catch lobster in California
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was swimming to catch lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season on Saturday.
The attack took place around 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help and that he then moved in with a group who helped him out of the water.
Hammel also stated that at first he thought the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but then realized that the scream M bit him!
He bit me!
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel claimed he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
No one knows the species of shark responsible for the attack.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but concluded that it was not a shark species that posed a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to strengthen its position in the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty products in the style of a department store with specialist sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite underperforming sales of household and fashion products, larger beauty sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and integrated into more stores next year if successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's representatives said the number of beauty products it offers will double to 3,000, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its make-up range, Boutique, which means that most of the products are aimed at vegan people, a demand increasingly found among young shoppers.
In addition, products from French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury's stores for testing purposes, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying smaller quantities of food each day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of retailer Sainsbury's, said outlets will increasingly look like department stores as supermarket chains try to compete with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has included both Argos products in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and cosmetics sections failed.
Sainsbury's attempted to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations stalled after a disagreement over how to share the revenues of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play a major role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to give you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary place to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract
The star of the TV show Dragons' Den, Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company has been compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show Dragons Den, by retiring at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angered when one of television's most beloved personalities admitted during a tense session at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allowed her to focus on their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household goods.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated value of £11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was quitting his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source says: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was almost time for the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of This Morning, who is among the UK's best-selling stars, could cost the company millions of dollars in damages, due to investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, and the possible further delay of the launch.
It can also mark the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business".
I was very tough, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider "unfitting for a president" and for having such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said imitating a news anchor voice.
I didn't take a step back.
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen an "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament moves.
The Commission also noted that the US continued to impose sanctions to put pressure on the US.
Trump had a more optimistic viewpoint in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well with respect to North Korea", he said.
We were headed for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but if I behaved like that, instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped arena, there would be about 200 people", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international relief efforts.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a difficult situation", Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known if foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia endures, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be underprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very common on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a tsunami warning was issued, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even under the best of circumstances, travel between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate matters even more.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has set up improving Indonesia's precarious infrastructure as the focus of his election campaign and has over-allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sectarians as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores the game-winning goal and equalises the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from the opposing team's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before kicking it toward the goal.
The ball reached over the goal line, heading for the top right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
"I just had to try to get into the ideal position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to go as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took the ball away.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue forward passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then he turned into the middle of the field and ran towards the half of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he threw the ball to Hazard, who got in the basket.
Hazard overcame the defence and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00, in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the national disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings by Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake that triggered waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered in debris from the collapse of buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to this issue to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who recorded any useful material using the onboard camera to contact us if they have information essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman from Birkenhead and that she was found on a property.
This afternoon, several people who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building have been told that it will be a few more hours before they are allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, a woman showed up in tears.
It's so awful.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another one was outside.
A few police officers were standing on the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to the police @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be affected by the altercations over "write history"
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical puritan successors.
But Cromwell's society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, to be the defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who is part of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead after an artery was cut and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui Market, Guizhou Province, according to the Sunday editorial in the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he had come with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby barn was open.
He stated that there was a large male pig in the pen with blood in his mouth.
The coroner confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised", said the cousin, whose last name is Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor his cousin.
A market representative told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It seems Yuan's family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300-pound pig, a man in Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
Just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve, he said.
Hurricane Rosa, now in its weakest form, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves into cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa was reporting winds of up to 53 miles per hour, becoming a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Sunday and was located about 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that will interact with the depression zone will generate heavy rain in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 3 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly desert landslides.
The intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 cm is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible due to rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds in gusts and dust.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to areas of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of almost 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona in the late afternoon of Sunday and early afternoon of Monday, before the rain spreads further on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and will continue through Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes will be recorded in the United States as the Arctic region becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are being experienced throughout the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures reaching as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C] in areas stretching from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press statement by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of an alleged 1980s sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting their regular Friday programming for a breaking news story: an agreement made between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the jury that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was drunk and that he had tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100% sure that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from their desk.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to get on an elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He sat looking down for a few minutes while people argued with him, and it was all live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling us the truth?
She was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote live in the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he'd only do that if the FBI agreed to look into the charges against the nominee next week, which is what the minority Democrats are demanding.
Flake was convinced, in large part, by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was a big one, obviously, because Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that accompanied his photo on the front page of the paper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect tariffs on each other was "completely ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting and killing the LSU quarterback.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, age 20, was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is something that worries me all the time", Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater started and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center monitors multiple rumbling and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote for secession, bringing together thousands of opposing protesters.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept at arm's length from the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
The scuffle escalated later, with police using batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while union protesters chanted "Long live Spain!"
14 people have received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region, which is seeking independence a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although turnout was low and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region, leading to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out overnight Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of the best years of my life.
I watched my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we have nothing else to do", he said.
Despite winning a vital but close victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
As a candidate in the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: several men were arrested after they drove into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday, at approximately 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that there was damage to the gates and even the building.
It appears that at some point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston left the Rangers without a reply, with Steven Gerrard coming off his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side played on equal footing with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premier League this season and face leaders Hearts, eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the vicious visitors
Holt's team should have been way ahead before they scored, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to kick into the goal space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after he went through the slip to intercept the headed ball from Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors on free kicks.
And that's how the crucial goal came.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to pass to Menga, who kicked and scored from the centre of the net.
At that stage, the Rangers dominated possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely undisturbed for the rest of the game.
This pattern of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Rangers' Allan McGregor, and Lithgow took a wide hit from another Livingston player.
Diagonal passes continued to come into Livingston's team's court, but without success, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett rammed Glenn Middleton and after a hiccup - were not accepted.
Fenomenal game provided by Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They've been excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and team have not changed at all since their return to the top, but Holt has to be given credit for the way he has coached his team since taking over.
He had so many role models.
Captain Halkett was great, with a superbly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they have performed well under Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were a failure, they only managed once to catch the opponents' free throw, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was rosy on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at mending relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the town, at around 10:15am.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted to the area, bus routes are diverted and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in a brawl
Six prison officers were injured in a brawl at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a scuffle broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30am and it is ongoing.
Specialist officers were brought in to deal with the brawl, which involved eight inmates, isolated in a wing.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesperson stated: The assistance of specialized prison staff has been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, riot police officers were called to the prison to deal with a very serious situation, staff being attacked with pool balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
It's rare for a tropical depression to occur in Arizona, but it's quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources from Hurricane Rosa will be used up in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and rainfall will occur in the second half of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a Twitter post that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with activity about 37 miles (60 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5 to 10 inches of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 15 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-western desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, amounts of 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible amounts of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas torrential rain will be beneficial as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing a drought of the second-highest category, information found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still hurricane-force on Sunday morning with winds of up to 86 miles per hour, is 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and therefore diminish.
It is expected to produce landslides in Mexico with a tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, posing a high risk of flooding.
Torrential rainfall of 8 to 10 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and could reach 25 centimeters, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or its remnants is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States", said a National Hurricane Center official.
These rains are expected to produce flash floods that will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The officers asked for help from citizens who might have material on their mobile phones, i.e. to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" from the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also stated that Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually harassed her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw that day the genius, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a point of indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running, he said.
For this reason, I express my positive opinion of the candidates I consider to be extraordinary everywhere.
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake, number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by huge waves that hit beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when waves as high as six meters hit the beach at dusk, taking people underwater and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately run away, becoming victims", BNPB disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami brought cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled offshore at 800 km/h before hitting shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
The photos released by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, the official added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extinguished" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
He added: 'This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.'
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for failing to report that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In social media posts, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building frantically shouting tsunami warnings to people on the next street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that shut down communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: "They told me they saw many destroyed houses".
The situation is very serious.
Even as aid groups began disaster relief efforts, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material supplies and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can start international relief efforts, but nothing has been announced yet.
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the national paraglider team coach, was training for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliders.
Other people held at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
Given my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden, he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors attending the beach festival.
But next to his messages, there was only one gray billboard, not two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't transmitted", he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole the sum of $26,750 from a Brink employee who was feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to move more cash, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that needed to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding their identities is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to Ye.
He made the announcement about the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The individual officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and is using that title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
He's replacing Ariana Grande, who canceled for emotional reasons, the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year during a discussion about the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is about us.
It all started with Kanye, which means the unique, and it ended up with Ye, which is a reflection of our good, bad, fuzzy things and the whole.
The album is more a reflection of who we are as people.
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs has had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And one of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with a dash, sometimes without, and even with capital letters.
The President of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for AI
As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double the amount it spends on AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and user who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government made announcements about AI, even though the US lacks an official strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China laid out its plan last year: it aims to be the number one AI innovation country by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat American gamer Othello, the best in the field at the time, and later was chief executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee appreciated previous US government competitions in technology, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is putting the brakes on academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding college graduates to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US step up its AI efforts.
I think PhD students should be given visas automatically in AI, he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint AI Centre to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Selection Board.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Also, right now, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes to the US legislation that aimed to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on whether they wanted the country's name to be changed to Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposes its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on voter turnout, with the minimum 50% threshold for validating the referendum likely to be missed.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, must pay to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in Parliament is required.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of eligible voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change, which would allow it to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, not through the back door, Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said one result in favor of changing the name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible citizens will participate in the referendum, below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for change.
For the referendum to be valid, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since taking over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manages to go through Brighton's entire defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have managed to get past Brighton's defence and score a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero had it incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly through three defensive players at Brighton before reaching the free throw line.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender and then overtake several opposing players at the edge of the Brighton team's net.
Then he made a left pass, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is experiencing some leg problems", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who got them the initial lead for the Blues in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on Brighton's territory at that point.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a left-sided pass.
Sane dribbled the ball a few times before he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it towards the goal.
The Blues forward hit the ball into the net just before he went out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim at 12:55 on Tuesday in the group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc on the Rockies game.
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have earned at least an unpredictable spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to hold on to their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?
The national team has not yet announced the opener for Sunday's game, but sources say they are inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the opening shot of the game with the 34th pick, had a warm-up session Thursday and will pitch under normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court's decision on Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
All our efforts are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I try very hard to support good candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "Look at this terrible, radical group of Democrats, look at what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you can see their malice.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we're not going to give it.
He also said that the democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see that over the last four days", he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and mean, naughty and lying".
He referred to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was booed loudly by the public.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
- There you go.
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute  that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
I was not at all surprised that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censure motion on me.
After all, I'm just one of the Labour Party members of Parliament who's been told they're not welcome just because we've expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
For me, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which even Jeremy had no common views with previous leaders.
The Labour Party's communication for Friday's Nottingham East meeting stated that we 'want our meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a Labour Party Member of Parliament, Friday night GC meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not go this way, and the promise of a 'better, milder' political environment has long been forgotten, if ever fulfilled.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree to some things that I would not have agreed to before, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there's a wave of abuse on social media that demands my removal from the party, denouncing centrist politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who's facing this.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each motion of censure or change in the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have been telling me for the last two years to keep my head down, to not be so vocal, and everything will be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence of the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that they are unclear about my views on politics and the issues I disagree with in relation to the current leadership.
To the people who supported Friday's motion, I can only say that, in the context of the country heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to send is not to the Momentum group in Nottingham, but to the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of expulsion from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I believe are in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Labour Party member for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr football team tops the league standings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's highly interactive match in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the standings, being the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as making the most of the opportunities that came up, which helped the home team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to several tests during our matches so far and we continue to be unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The credit goes to Ayr, they took their chances more than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed try.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even at half-time, managed to score, and then managed to convert an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's baggot-turned-essay cut the lead to five.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field with the tarmac, and from the restart of the game, Ayr was unleashed through the attempt of player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an untransformed try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for pleasing Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving Ayr the advantage.
Climo turned the attempt, as he did again near the restart of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a box kick move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry deep for the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems poised for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Ford Kiernan, star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems poised to move into the hospitality industry after learning he's been named CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the beloved BBC show, writing the script and starring alongside his longtime partner, comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, number nine, would be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "growing restaurant industry".
The sea is ours: Bolivia island hopes court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling a crane-filled naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right".
We have to get her back.
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive  as is the desire to sail again into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the outcome with a positive vision", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that after decades of firm discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate a sovereign landing zone for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president  who faces a controversial re-election fight next year  also has much to gain from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that very little would change if it did.
The UN body within the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleadings were heard indicates that this case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia not been successful in its cause, but it's possible that the last four years have given it back.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has weakened any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most beloved presidents  used the maritime issue as political support.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Decision is an opportunity to see that we must move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won 't happen unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during a summit in Singapore with the leaders of the rivals.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "unrealistic dream" that continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would ever cause the northern territory to surrender.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who don't believe Pyongyang has any serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you're looking for hats to expand your collection or to completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked attendees at Paris Fashion Week by launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and fashion designers have sent their eye-stealing creations onto the runway.
Valentino's signature piece was an extravagant beige hat with a wide, feather-like bore into which the models' heads were sunk.
Other oversized accessories included pear-shaped watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and carried more of the accessory Hannibal Lecter chose, rather than haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a scuba gear, with an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt this style of clothing, with oversized items, you're in luck.
Fashion designers predict a return of huge hats in high-end fashion stores.
Oversized hats are back after the appearance of the La Bomba hat, the wide-brimmed straw hat seen in everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the not-so-practical hat that has appeared on all social media has led to the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bag, which is as big as the model in the bathing suit wearing it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus's 2019 La Riviera Spring-Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The star's stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer, because the designer has made such a strong impact that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore".
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizenship
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for secondary and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust people in other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher A grade certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held in the same place as STEM subjects in independent school curricula and other fields.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that of the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming imperative in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having this skill throughout their life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in foreign language learning is important for today's children.
Having more languages, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach another foreign language.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be more languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and empower children with the skills to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at this moment, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done well .
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where voters favor him, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his choice for the vacant Supreme Court seat temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and where can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the expected Senate confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a tough election in November, gain some ground.
So, the Trump campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is "to energize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election by a margin of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading in the polls.
"The fact that the president has come to try to push him in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows determination and continues to fight to keep up the chance for the singles events that begin Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it's possible that Saturday afternoon's foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-changing pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but the players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"We were six points ahead, now we're only four points behind, so we're counting on this drop for a bit of motivation", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still 12 points to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to turn in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to be encouraged, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have each won three of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green with lethal precision, setting an example for his teammates.
Those guttural celebration screams grew louder as he rounded out the lead, especially when he scored a crucial point to tie the score in the fourth after he and Thomas were two points clear after the first two holes.
The punch that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game", says Spieth.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe have won four of their four games and it seems they can't fail.
Moliwood was the only pair that didn't need any extra punches on Saturday afternoon, but that statement holds true for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they were to lead to a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time, in different holes.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs event, when he paired with Alex Noren.
An extra hit and two doubles on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep they were nowhere near coming out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourball and foursome trials are fascinating and worth watching closely because of the interactions between pairs, the tips given and ungiven, and how a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, something that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after ending Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pairing of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs event and won the series 3-1.
The USA put up a more serious resistance at the foursome event, where they won two matches but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 straight games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to score four points in the opening four matches in the entire history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they held on superbly to defeat the discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in Saturday's two games, has had occasional flashes of genius, but so far has lost 19 of his 29 games at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which have been straight losses.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome event and defeated them 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three.
Europe did not have a smooth ride on this pleasant, cool day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time major champion, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, gaining two points on Saturday.
They managed to win 2-1 in a match against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to make up a four-point deficit in singles, although because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need a draw.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that prolonging sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Global Council's annual General Assembly that North Korea had implemented "significant measures to demonstrate its good faith" over the past year, such as halting nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no appropriate response from the US", he said.
If we cannot trust the United States, we will not trust our national security capabilities, and under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's resistance to a "stepped" approach to denuclearization, that North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump offered assurances on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not acted on calls for the easing of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation first and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don't know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader had mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, in the past five months, adding: If the denuclearization issue had been negotiated with South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse.
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of US soil with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who had threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for his courage in initiating the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned timeframe for this, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months".
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council the following Thursday: The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go over well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced him as making "gangster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launching pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised Singapore and that he wanted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a class on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to get more sleep in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture that causes them to undergo "all-night" study sessions, energized by high caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world's most prestigious university often do not even have a basic understanding of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
And at the end, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, last year?"
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the key concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section shows a picture of a dorm room, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sweatpants and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleep schedule.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
We know we can't instantly change student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know about the health effects of smoking, added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud of having studied all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough good-quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, which makes the students feel like they're constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling at this fiercely competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to tell them when it is time to go to bed and when to wake up, and to know the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's team down
The Rangers are suffering another case of on-the-go depression as Dolly Menga's shot sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 triumph in February against St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side managed to deliver Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, putting Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' uninspired players seemed unable to even the score.
Rangers thus dropped to sixth position in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian, by a single goal.
And the Rangers could face other problems as bench umpire Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the visitors' fans' lawn.
Gerrard replaced eight players from the squad that won easily against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a draw with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of how his well-trained squad smothered their opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored with just two minutes left in the game when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman into the Allan McGregor-defended goal, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her over the bar.
The Rangers have taken control, but they've left the impression that they're more hopeful than confident of their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although the Livingstone goal in the 34th minute did not follow the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if only for the effort put in.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep Jacobs centering.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and passed it to Menga, who finished with a single.
Gerrard acted at half-time when he replaced Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately as the extreme centered Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the back to block him.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors in exactly the same type of match he favoured, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centre after centre.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow sent a head-off near the goal with the corner kick.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at Rangers, asked for a penalty towards the end of the game when he hit Jacobs but again Thomson did not agree.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting)... is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans  Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A key device for science ever since, the Geiger counter has become essential to pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film The Bells of San Coronado, which starred Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboys with unlikely leanings toward science:
Man: What is this?
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms of radioactivity emitted in the minerals.
Yes, there's a lot of knocking!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" and destroy harmful cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a lab
They can "detect" a protein common to many cancers and then they're injected back into the bloodstream.
An experimental vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can "detect" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then injecting the cells back in.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "determines the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and "teach" them to target cancer cells, has also worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a Trump supporting diatribes while wearing a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist broke out in a speech against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
A lot of times when I talk to a white person, I'm asked, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get West to take the piss with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems backstage because of his hat.
They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat".
I was assaulted!
They also told me I was down a long way", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see how low I've fallen?" and then he said, "I'm going to grab my Superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love.
His comments drew a roar from the audience at least twice, and SNL staff members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a staff member told the publication: "There was complete silence in the studio".
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for lead singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he performed "I Love It" dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you for facing the GLOATA".
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their arta) who I believe embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and of course the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is due in front of the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO-produced violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that portraying these roles on screen makes boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that she felt that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow Game of Thrones cast member Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is "very determined" to talk about the issue.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about this now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?" he asked himself.
What have we taught men about being adults, given the problem we face now?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What do young boys learn from TV and the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: How can we change this?
Because it's clear that something's wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he admitted that he would not star in any series based on Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, saying that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so it ensured my family's future and my life going forward", Kit said.
Rose starred as Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the multi-Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission stem from inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data to Republican senators, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations are made by "far-right" analysts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other miserable lies", Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information leaked included the personal addresses and phone numbers of senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and provided the information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was not in any way responsible for the leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
It has to be calm and quiet".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by Democrats, who said he appeared a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on Twitter.
"Important if true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office alerted the appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered", she continued, "and that they are held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions to any of my team members".
Johnny English hits again: a no-holds-barred spoof of spy movies, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit-related meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action film parody series starring Johnny English, a series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Could this mocking satire of how weird we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the staring eyes and rubber face, has been renewed for a second time for his license to screw things up.
He's, of course, the crazed secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a little bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip from the guy who contributed a single note to the theme music of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This latest adventure of JE's has one or two nice moments too.
I liked when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades gently hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and, oddly enough, superfluous, especially since "serious" films such as those from the 007 series or Mission: Impossible confidently offer comedic moments as an ingredient.
The humor seems to appeal more to children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's wild adventures aren't as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's top-secret spy web and revealed the identities of British undercover agents, much to the dismay of the service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a pompous and besieged prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis due to declining political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn't give her a chance to shine.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate a reserve agent.
This is Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a high school, but also teaching classes on how to be an undercover agent.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then is reunited with his old partner, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of trouble-making in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, taking on the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of whimsical adventures: disguised as waiters, setting fire to a trendy French restaurant, creating chaos when they sneak aboard Volta's luxury ship, then English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a set of virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but as cute and colorful as the film is, it feels like a children's television production.
It's a pretty mediocre film.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies that they plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is said to have a radical plan whereby Britons would only work four days a week, but get paid for five.
It seems the party wants company bosses to take advantage of the savings possible from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, but the wage would not change.
Sources say the idea would "fit" with the party's economic program, which wants to tip the balance in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source in the Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times: "An announcement on a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a fitting aspiration in the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party's overall strategy on industry.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day workweek was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: The four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.
The shadow cabinet's Lord Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell has stated that he is determined to take back power from the "faceless directors" and "profiteers" of utility companies.
The shadow cabinet's Lord Chancellor's plans also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could be charged deductions because of found offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to company boards and to set up ownership funds to give away 10% of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to about £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded to drop their support for him because of the FBI's findings.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I've said that since the beginning of the hearings; I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came in and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decisive, prompt, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be set in stone.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would take some explosive charges", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett is adamantly rejecting the allegations", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to watch artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to undertake a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls, or other meaningful things that help raise awareness of the goal of ending global poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when there are only 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to act, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism, a concept that refers to people feeling like they've accomplished something by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million shares from its supporters, promoting different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in the account of which at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book, Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a live concert crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: What makes you think you can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval forces for a "blockade" that would hamper Russia's energy exports, says Home Secretary
Washington can, "if necessary", use naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's engagement in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason I'm in the Middle East is because I want to broker the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to manage the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke addresses attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that bills itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is basically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels", he said, saying Russia "knows only one trick" because of its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come as the Trump administration tries to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin has said that the fierce US opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we see things the same way: energy cannot be a tool to put pressure on and consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third country intervening in our energy issues", Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she must "seriously consider" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a run.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that takes a strong woman", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he "has steered the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that even a majority of Warren's voters don't think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of his and 48% are against.
Other names of some very well-known Democrats who may run in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, The Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks about the post-traumatic stress disorder that Track Palin suffers from at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, age 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
"The things my own son is going through, the things he's been through since he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who are feeling the ramifications of PTSD and the effects of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come back a little different, tougher, coming back wondering if there's any respect left for what they and their soldiers in the Army and Air Force, and all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence incident, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus brief Friday in Washington to support a challenge to the asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner and his violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations that face a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Council on Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law states that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle", the amicus curiae brief reads.
In addition, lawyers argue in the lawsuit that the policy of denying immigrants entry affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or political opinion", Sessions said on June 11 when announcing the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where deaths have doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly dire.
"The situation seems very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is taking her fever-stricken baby to an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances bring bodies in all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient.
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded property, trying to save whatever could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to the strong and continuous aftershocks.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers feeling the violent quake rattling his fifth-floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife when she cried for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of abusing propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese state newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred to the Chinese supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, on Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war, involving waves of tariff increases on imports.
The retaliatory tariffs imposed by China at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by posting propaganda ads in our own free press".
By spreading propaganda by posting an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is violating America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press, writes Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will see no real reflection of the divergent views Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers refused to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
With many of the top Republicans backing and protecting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"Reactions like this will not be forgotten", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Comes!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hallways as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news website.
People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided suburban female voters and the younger electorate, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing the sexual abuse allegations brought against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash might follow if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This has become a bit of a nuisance for Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be confirmed, but how the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic election advocacy group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided on which side they should believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or think it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said they strongly believe or think it is likely that Kavanaugh's testimony was true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh was lying, probably or definitely, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh molested her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals in front of her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data archives or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What's unique about this online personal data repository is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal data consolidation".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute the proper resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely upended all at once.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I has been commemorated in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew he was being awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "fantastic bravery", cleared the way for the soldiers, then single-handedly attacked an artillery nest and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I'll never be able to match, but it makes me feel humbled".
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he "feels very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he gets from a lot of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got Peppa Pig cartoons instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, only to miss the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One fan described the switch to children's cartoons on Twitter as "some kind of bad joke".
"Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6am, so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yeah.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they will schedule their events in a way that they can be watched by viewers in the UK.
"When I think about re-shoots, I think we could probably work it out", Coker said.
But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do it until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to resolve the situation, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't that. It was a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We're going to be down to five fights instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to give the fans more, and we overstepped the mark.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
A guest on the first Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay rights to give others "hope".
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the traditional show, will be out for a few months due to illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that as a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like both boys and girls".
He said, "So far, these feelings of inferiority and feeling different, they've been the real things that have given me the strength and resilience to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "somebody", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and used an appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he was taken by surprise when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the Oscar-winning filmmaker last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics when he was only 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same ups and downs".
The couple became parents in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed "his whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing but winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to do was find out if they had gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him you couldn't be the first, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to jump in front of my country's spectators at the Olympics, there is no greater feeling", he said.
This also inspired him in his chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still moves him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of form, was put on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back in shape to make sure it's not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed over on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursome trials.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the U.S. team, the five-time major championship winner has split his day between cheering for teammates and practicing his shots, hoping to right what went wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the most straight drives, even in the prime of his career, so he's not the best choice for the tight court at Le Golf National, where long rough patches often punish incorrect shots.
And if the field isn't a big enough challenge, in Sunday's ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, who are four points clear of the 12-game playoff, which is set to begin in force at this stage.
Furyk declared himself confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said otherwise anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he patted me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's very confident in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but this is what happened and this is how I thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never rose to his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought some intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with the players, he's a great guy in the team locker room", he explained.
I think the young players are having fun playing with him, it was fun to watch them do that during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game.
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable lead could soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable lead held before the first day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to beat them by a bare minimum of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remember we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win", said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 team, which won 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, now lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and my team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at maximum speed.
Let's get out on the field and make everything perfect.
The game is not over until the points are passed to the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, that must remain the goal.
We always say, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what's waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world.
Pleased with how his players handled themselves on a difficult pitch, Bjorn added: 'I'm not rushing to conclusions.
Tomorrow is a whole different situation.
Tomorrow's all about individual performance, and this is different.
It's great to be on the court with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, that's when you're tested the most, as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to the players, that they have to be at their best tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and have to play as best they can.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the opposing team's captain, hopes his players will play better in the singles event than they did with their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such comebacks on the final day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe achieved the "miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to cheer his players up before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow and we'd like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We've created the proper batch and we've ordered the players the way we want, you know, we're trying to create a little bit of magic tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main bout, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the schedule.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers all subjects", Bjorn said of the batch for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to be commissioned in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to go on missions of up to two years without returning to their original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to boost Germany's naval strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated frigate F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the crews of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship proved to be overweight, which reduced her performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, became a concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was "beginning to run out of ships that can be sent on missions".
The official said the problem had steadily increased over time as old vessels were taken out of service without being replaced with new ones.
It regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had entered service with the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use their environment to hunt prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unusual flying mammals and help future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species emit particular sounds.
A habitat map and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scale-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grassland, and which is the best way to maintain forest grasslands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by habitat loss.
And wind turbines and street lighting are risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks, and 76,000 acres of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect nests, and sometimes conduct rescue missions.
The organisation even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve, on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species are found.
The property manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here at Threave, the area is wonderful for bats", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to reproduce.
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on properties, as the mere unintentional destruction of a mother's nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which could wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing or disturbing them, and destroying their nests, are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the accusations against him are "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to advertise using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicious privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for "moral damage equivalent to an amount appropriate to the gravity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was 99% a good boy, and that he was betrayed by that 1%.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she contacted the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but she later agreed to a settlement outside the courtroom because she was "terrified of the possibility of revenge" and was worried that "she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to nullify that agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused of, Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain would forever regret losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford plant where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'fix-it-time' principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which industrial manufacturers say could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays".
"We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success we have now but also to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would have to stop, but warned that increased prices could reduce the factory's competitiveness in the long run and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the factory, said members were increasingly worried: "My experience has been that once these jobs disappear, they don't come back".
A government spokesman said: We have created a clear and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the assistant attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president via the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied that report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It's not set yet, it could be this week or it could be postponed by a week, given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders claimed that the reduction in briefings was not due to antipathy towards TV reporters, who like to show off, though he added: "I don't deny that they like to show off".
Then he suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President attends more question and answer sessions than all previous presidents, she said, adding without citing any evidence: I have looked at the figures.
"There will be more briefings", Sanders said, "but I think it's much better that the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me".
We try to do this most of the time, and you can see that we've done this a lot in the last few weeks, and the talks with the president of the United States will replace the press briefings when they're available.
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening by making an impromptu appearance in bizarre locations in front of gathered reporters.
A Secretary of State for Health addresses a letter to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State has written to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and wishes them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is less than six months away.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applying for permanent residence for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also started to prepare increasingly for a different scenario, where there would be no deal to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from within and outside the European Union have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit patients and the communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head in Saturday's game that his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores, 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the shot came just before halftime.
"He reached the touchline and just collapsed", Reed said.
Abercrombie was fitted with an oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical staff on the line before being put on a stretcher and transported off the field for a thorough evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of surgery he had at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five total tackles before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court stamp fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help homeless people under new Conservative Party plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The court stamp duty will be applied to persons who are not taxpayers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of court stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising homes at lower prices and targeting high-income earners.
The higher court stamp fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not tax payers in the United Kingdom and the additional money thus raised will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which is added to the current court stamp duty, including the high levels of two years ago for second property and properties bought for rental, could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring in an extra up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the court stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
It accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by buying land without using it and asked Theresa May to drop taxes on affordable houses in order to solve the UK's 'housing problem'.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unjustified evictions.
It also wants to give councils greater powers in terms of building new homes.
Theresa May said the following: Last year I said that I would devote my term as Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing the problems that exist in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as hardworking UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too remote, and living in undignified conditions is far too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scotland national team.
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland Football Club, said that his "ultimate goal" is to become manager of the Scotland national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of "reviving" the north-eastern club, who are currently in third place in the Premier League, three points clear of first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren to promotion back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I made the national team B team and that's about it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only get this opportunity if I succeed as a manager of the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not excited to succeed such established names at such a big club after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The only thing that worries me and could affect my success is the question: Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities of this club allow it to be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to help the club get back to the Premier League.
Ross has only three years' experience in management, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to Division C and managed to save St Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross said he felt better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a decisive moment", he said of taking over the management of Alloa.
I really thought I was better suited to the manager role than the player.
It may sound strange, because I had a good run, I was winning well and I had some good moments.
But it's hard being a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm facing similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel like it's the right role for me.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I can do that, I feel like it's the best thing that's going to happen to me in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30, according to one poll
The heat wave this summer has led to a rise in revenues in pubs across the UK, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars increased by 2,7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4,8%.
Peter Martin, representative of business consultancy CGA who conducted the survey, said: The constant heat and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance contributed to a pattern in July similar to the previous month, with pubs registering up to 2.8% more customers while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers down by 1,8% in the restaurant industry in June decreased further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks made a much higher profit than restaurants.
And pubs that serve food have also seen heat loss, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just went out into town for drinks.
Sales of drinks at all bars and pubs rose 6.6% this month, while food sales fell 3%.
Paul Newman, representative of the hospitality services company RSM, said: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to make losses, although the decline in sales of 4.8% year on year will add to the current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will tell whether the cooler temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2,7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.

One in five children has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents
According to one survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social networking account that he hides from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears about sexual content posts
20% of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, create a social networking account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts, referring to the photo-sharing platform Instagram.
The news has raised fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said they had a "main" and "clean" account that they showed their parents, but they also had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account noticed a teenager posting a message asking to be "raped".
According to research by the UK-based company Digital Awareness and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot access".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletes' Commission.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletes' Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the chairman, described the change as a great opportunity for decision-makers in the sport to benefit from the vast experience it has gained internationally over the last decade.
Eilidh is respected throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit significantly from his inclusion on the committee, said Beattie.
Doyle also said: I am delighted to be able to represent athletes and hope to make a real contribution and help the way sport is run in Scotland.
The American-born athlete, who won the 200 and 400 metres events at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to her four Olympic gold medals, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, has been left disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if or how much I would recover.
It was a titanic job, but I made a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad comparing women to cows is dividing online opinion
A breast pump company has caused a public split online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that aims to be "the world's first portable, silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of hay to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't bumps, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pompe, pompe, I breastfeed the baby, pompe, pompe, I suck the milk off the girls".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it exposes the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen just days after birth, one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/mother)
Another person commented: "It's understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "A highly inappropriate advertisement".
Other people defended the ad, one person claiming that he found it "hilarious".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little inappropriate, but I took it as it was.
But the product is brilliant", wrote one person.
Another person commented: It's a funny ad that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like babies.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their babies and even go out while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother commented: Pompa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it's like to use a breast pump and the challenges of using one, and show, in a fun and realistic way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were smuggled into a refugee camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children being detained has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear that they will jeopardize their stay in the country if they ask to take the children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must be fingerprinted and their data will be reported to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80% of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are living in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we're going to keep looking for those individuals", Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing in the children's system, the authorities introduced new rules that require children to appear in court one month after detention, instead of 60 days as the previous standard required, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead their case via video call, rather than face an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those not deemed eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are heightened in a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs that indicate a child is in trouble may not be noticed because of the size of the unit.
They added that sending children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause them the trauma that many of them already suffer.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish military forces withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are in Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be handled appropriately".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He also stated that Damascus will continue this "sacred fight" until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territory.
There are approximately 2,000 US military troops in Syria, primarily engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were in place for their return and accused 'some Western countries' of 'spreading irrational fears' which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: 'We have asked for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return'.
Political influence is being brought to bear on a problem that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarised zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last remaining rebel group has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avert a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra Front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes to soon convene a first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and issued a warning about interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless impeachment proceedings or scandals end his presidency early, which a large portion of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
If so, it would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!
So far, it seems the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has set a record with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a subject that appeals to the public because we can't understand it", said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "The President's Reserves", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else being aired on TV, the action taking place in Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited and about the state of the global economy.
Changing jobs is a luxury only the privileged public can afford.
However, you're not the only informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate on how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (an opulent article of clothing, according to The Washington Post) and the implications of actress Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Trump's "anatomical parts".
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show and feeding into it every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Hole Shares", about the constantly changing cast and daily upheavals Trump is causing (triggering a fight with the Pro Football League, praise of Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let yourself miss an episode, because you'll feel like you're falling behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the north shore of Kauai, it was 90 degrees outside and sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a redistricting that resulted in two incumbents in a race for the same office, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District has overwhelming financial resources.
So the new Pittsburgh suburb district has brought in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won another special election district last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, with district boundaries being manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign finance competition between the major party funding bodies, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, high-audience election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For more than a decade, the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won this district by a 20-point margin.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then dropped it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support, were considered.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an outside analyst who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which there is now solid evidence of has been made public.
It also appears that Mueller is also focusing his investigation on the investigation of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in relation to the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear before voters and perhaps, eventually, a jury of his peers.
There are many possible scenarios and I don't want to suggest that a "fall" of Trump is inevitable, which is also true for his European counterparts.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make that will determine the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed it and supported the Czechs in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid years of carnage that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating on its incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times' story was incorrect.
How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, he emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win in the Austrian game after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of action this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to their advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, considering that Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we won a point.
We could have probably scored at the end, but overall, I think the draw was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
Thursday, it will be another important night for Europe.
With a little luck we'll get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game played.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but things are better now.
The team is good and the boys really like being here; training is going well, too.
Let's hope we persevere, that we put the past behind us and that we get good results.
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said that they discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't start the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with the counsellor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Get your financial adviser involved: the financial advisor can also be a real help in paying these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or you can insure your own welfare  to the extent you have the money.
Get your legal paperwork straight: come to the legal problems.
Get a power of attorney for medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Consider also making a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Remember the little details: Imagine that an elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all about the financial side.Can you tell me who the doctors are who are dealing with this?" asked Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Make a plan for all of these things.
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle while walking home from a night out on the town.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which occurred at 2:30 a.m., as "random shootings".
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The injuries sustained are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses to testify.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu city that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coastline of over 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region that is located at the bottom of a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fish farming and agriculture are the core of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining activities are also important in the province but are mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra island, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died because of collapsed buildings.
2018: Several strong earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on violent charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded 100% innocent when asked to testify, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been accused of this.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, engaging in a domestic violence crime complaint and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin came under fire from veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was linked to the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after serving in the military in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off the coast of Central Sulawesi province, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The U.S. Attorney's Office wants the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
The New York State Attorney's Office wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rented truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in its path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the plea agreement on the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts are eligible for the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that include eight counts of murder in the support of organized crime, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required substantial "planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "abominable, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to investigators that he was happy with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
Also, according to the cops, he asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the pro-bono lawyers who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea with life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of Parliament Theresa May who suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, told a Birmingham demonstration that the UK would have left by now if Farage had been Secretary of State for the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces in terms of the highly divided camps was heightened by Conservative Party members joining another protest against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to get his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, to go ahead, facing attacks from those who support leaving, those who want to stay, and from the European Union.
Allies stressed that she would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted the Chequers plan to be scrapped.
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given the associated responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had run things, we would not be in the European Union,' he said.
The Conservative MP for Wellingborough added: I support Brexit, but we must drop the Chequers plan.
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he stated: "We did not fight in the world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone denied suggestions of changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union.
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the pro-Brexit Conservative Party, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither do our activists who are taking to the streets and supporting us in the first place in the elections.
Drop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to Theresa May, she added: Prime Ministers who keep their job are those who keep their promises.
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians must be put in a position to "feel the pressure" if they are about to back down from the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let them do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists held up banners that read 'The Conservative Party is against Brexit' after the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for digitising customs, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a joke.
Brexit does not bring benefits, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a Republican member of the House of Representatives who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of eligible citizens using the city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our badly damaged government and that includes having a woman at the helm".
A suspect has been arrested in the death of LSU quarterback Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11:00 ET.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
Sims, age 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, to being in possession of a weapon, but also to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-9 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, starting 10 times last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team would play a crucial role in the race.
In first place in the standings, Bottas had a good start and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the pits and left Hamilton at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pits a lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to push ahead after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior clear after making a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the grid and was seventh near the end of the first lap, on the very day he turned 21.
He then led for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to pass Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth.
He finally stopped at the box on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me pass.
And the team did an excellent job to get the win over Ferrari and to get this double", said Hamilton.
Horrible body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not facilitate the "leak" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "violent, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and immoral and lying", he said.
When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn't do it.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When I asked Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the leak of the document?
Remember her answer? She said, um...here?
Oh, no, not really.
I didn't do this.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that? No, we didn't, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leak" occurred from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations against Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the leak of her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and that's exactly what I did.
But her denial didn't seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday: "To be honest, it was terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using the accusations to achieve their own ends.
They are determined to seize power by any means possible.
Look at the evil, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control", the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's Elite League loss, beating the Belfast Giants in Saturday's 5-3 return to Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier hitting.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who had reclaimed the field by beating Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their final three games.
Dwyer's opening play was triggered in the fourth minute, 3:35 from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford decisively passed to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score for a tie at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first half when he scored his second run of the game late in the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalised with an impressive goal in the 27th minute and 37th minute.
Later in the second innings, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage to Dundee for the first time in that match, securing the team's fifth-place finish in the standings at the half-way mark.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes on Friday in their next game.
An air traffic controller died after securing the takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero, dying after he secured the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several strong aftershocks have occurred in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking violently.
He remained on the ground to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped from the air traffic control tower when he noticed it was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
A spokesperson for the Indonesian air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
'We are saddened by this news,' he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is restricted in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe the number will increase because many victims are still under the rubble and we have not had access to many of them", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass funeral is to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings in casualties.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the convenience stores are being robbed.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find on the ground.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?, announced CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which left more than 550 dead.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes in Micronesia lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now reports one person is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also mentioned that she is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the United States Navy stated that the plane missed the runway and ended up in a lagoon nearby.
Some witnesses believe the plane has passed the end of the runway.
Passenger Bill Jaynes, an American citizen, said the plane came within a very short distance of the ground.
"It's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-deep water and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on a dock renovation jumped to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank 100 feet underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents involving airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of these included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its plea in favor of retrial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone recordings to piece together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from multiple cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called to the witness box and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he anticipated the jury would decide by the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to change the negative perception of hip-hop music with songs with positive messages.
Bristol-based band The High Breed argues that hip-hop has stopped conveying political messages and addressing social issues as it originally did.
They want to go back to the roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
There has been a recent revival of artists like The Fugees and Common in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her after she received a text message that said " racist "
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied that they were racist, stating that she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she reported for her first day of work in 2016.
Another person of color, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the blunder, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, had not performed her duties properly and that she had expected to receive a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now she is suing the couple for severance pay and is seeking $350 a day for six months, during which she was to live with them and work, despite the fact that she was doing so without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not what happens", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied claims of being racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent him the wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you've wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn?
Let's be serious.
Considering the trial an "extortion" action, Plasco stated that his wife was due in two months and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
Do you really want to get back at a person under these circumstances?
This is not the way to do it, the banker investor added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington's story were concerned that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said the following about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, before it's published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had such a huge success.
She also stated that her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a "sweet-bitter" one after he died last year.
Of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father took a modest pride in the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a quiet man and didn't like to brag", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you're proud of him, even though it's not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his own imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad calls me frequently to tell me that it is very serious and that she does not think she will survive", said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of the medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping began to wear off and leave her body.
He had died a short time ago and his organs were starting to stop working.
I was forced to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have controlled myself.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the death of his daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I kept my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Two grieving women place messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them motivational and including phone numbers people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day", she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he had reached a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you're going to have a domino effect".
It created the messages to tell people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Externalise yourself, you need to talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was not feeling well or that he was depressed", she said.
A few days before Christmas, I noticed that his attitude had changed.
She was in a sorry state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and she didn't even look them in the eye.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they need to get over it: It caused immense pain within the family.
We are devastated.
But we have to go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI investigates
"I thought if we could get something similar to what he was asking for  a limited-time, small-scale investigation  we might have some unity", Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was on the verge of "disintegrating" amid a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the time factor.
With just five weeks left until the November 6 election - if, as predicted, Republicans do poorly, their efforts to place their favorite winner in the nation's highest court will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept calling on senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear if Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make up the difference in a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is declining under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said that about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by those who smuggle people across the border.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
A vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in broad terms, to work together for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of causing the lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in such situations, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", declaring him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, as "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if it was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice from emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a grotesque and coordinated assassination of character, staged by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi veered off the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I just want to say this: if he doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say 'wow, that's great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribua, it's months and years of anger built up and he can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
You don't think it's anything out of the ordinary, do you?
She continued: "I got some significant help from a woman who was an executive who told me that she cried when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because you see me crying.
I'm really nervous.
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing.
Tears are allowed for the expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying out of ineffable rage, was being grabbed by the neck by an older woman, a cold manager who I always felt a little afraid of, and she led me up the stairs.
"She must never see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they made you feel that way.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
"It was not a well thought-out decision", she laughs, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was coming to a close, she was behind on fundraising and vowed not to enter the race unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked herself.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions  resulting from gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination  that she lost her voice because of emotions.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls about the press reactions to her.
You'd think one of my sponsors is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my headstone.
Did she cry?
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salvos that heralded the start of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and while it looks like there's a long way to go before it ends, the feuds between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs that hit $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all Chinese goods entering the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing a tariff of between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to any blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly yielding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty policy decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than previously thought", said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to get things back to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to flee due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States now recorded their sixth consecutive win in Europe and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who put in incredible efforts for most of the tournament, sent the ball from the opening shot into the water on the third hair of the 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari had an incredible performance in all of the innings, becoming one of only four players to finish 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost at the 5th and 4th holes to the last-place player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost at the 2nd and 1st holes to England's Ian Poulter in what was probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A veteran Ryder Cup player who played in eight editions, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most victories, averaging 25.5 points throughout his career.
I'm not used to crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could be of help, Garcia said, excited after the European win.
He hands the relay to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at the 2nd and 1st holes in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put in a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played exceptionally well throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of them, they really tried.
This morning, there were a few moments where I put pressure on the European team.
I fought a fierce battle.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must give them the respect they deserve.
They played better than us.
