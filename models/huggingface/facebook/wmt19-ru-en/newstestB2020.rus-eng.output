Coordinator of Navalny's Arkhangelsk staff sentenced to public works
In the Oktyabrsky District Court of Arkhangelsk, the verdict was announced against Andrei Borovikov, the coordinator of Alexei Navalny's regional headquarters.
For repeated violation of the rules for holding rallies (Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the so-called Dada article), the court assigned him 400 hours of mandatory work, reports a Kommersant correspondent from the courtroom.
The case was initiated in April of this year for organizing a rally against the construction of a landfill in Arkhangelsk Oblast.

On the eve of the announcement of the verdict, on September 26, the court held arguments between the parties.
The prosecution insisted on forced labour for three years.
A restraint measure was imposed on me in the form of restriction of liberty, which means that I cannot attend public mass events and cannot communicate with the organizers of the protest action of April 7.
"All this time I wore an electronic bracelet and a base.
So they tracked my location.
I will note that I was not restricted in my movements.
Recently I arrived from Moscow, where I was training, "said Andrei Borovikov.
After the verdict was announced, the coordinator of Navalny's regional headquarters said that he would serve his sentence in Arkhangelsk.
On September 26, a deputy from the Communist Party faction, Sergei Shargunov, introduced a bill to the State Duma that would soften Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

The Kazans suffered four consecutive defeats in the Russian championship and also crashed out of the Cup.
We tune in for every game, "Izvestia Mogilev is quoted as saying.
So we all need to think about the reasons for such poor matches.
There are more meetings ahead - we must prepare for them and correct the situation.
How?
If we had known, we probably would have corrected it.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to add in such a component as single combats.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes US "Taipei Bill"
China strongly opposes the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill," which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiqu√©s.
Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the State Council's Office of Taiwan Affairs, said Friday.
Approval of the bill by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is also a serious violation of international law and basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguang said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and the issues related to it are part of China's internal affairs.
"We call on the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China must and will be reunified.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguang emphasized.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reports.
According to the documents obtained by the publication, the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) uses the app to promote China's foreign policy goals abroad.
Most violations of China's policies fall under the heading of "hate speech."
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the social network's actions do not look like censorship.
For example, the prohibition on criticizing China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticizing or attacking the politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incident or the Cambodian genocide falls under "distorting the history of China or other countries."
The document also contains a list of banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document said.
The banned material falls into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are removed by social media administrators and may lead to the blocking of the user.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules were outdated and no longer applied: "We are now using a localized approach to moderation, as well as engaging independent local experts."
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
The Production Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" is coordinated with representatives of social networks, but user materials can be placed without coordination, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov says yes and says that he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital agency, Roman Zaripov, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are enumerated in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."
But these rules can be applied to any content that moderators do not like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Administrators of social networks check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: a neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that a user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork co-working.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the bank's phone number has increased.
Kommersant reports this with reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to telecom operators information about more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial institutions received calls.
In 189 cases, operators detected a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases restrictions were imposed on the use of financial services.
Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had encountered the number change.
He explained that operators do not always respond to warnings from the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the law "On communications."

According to the press service of Beeline, part of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would disrupt the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters "numbers, to which the telecommunications operator will turn at every call to check the number.
He explained that the creation of such a framework would require amendments to legislation.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary General said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Answering the question of whether the issue was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue, and stressed that in his reply he did not mention the timing of Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must fulfill certain conditions to meet specific standards, writes RT.
Crimea offers Green an alternative to NATO course
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, instead of pursuing NATO membership, should focus on establishing good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation are established.
Earlier, on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky about the country's accession to the alliance.
According to him, for this, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, MP Yevgeny Balitsky said that Ukraine's possible accession to the alliance does not guarantee better life in the country.

Barcelona blackmail Neymar
Spanish "Barcelona" and its former footballer Brazilian Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the striker's move to French "Paris Saint-Germain."
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans suggested the player resolve the dispute without Themis' intervention.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, have an interesting trick: according to the agreement with Bar√ßa, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward turned up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received ¬£22m from the Catalans and now wants to pick up the remaining 18.
Not only that, the Brazilian's lawyers insist the club also owe him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
Blue-pomegranate insists the bonus was paid for the fulfilment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was only entitled to a quarter of 40 million euros and is demanding a return of a proportionate share of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Bar√ßa almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but there is still hope for the forward's return.
And now, as Sports.Ru reports with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers have told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial procedure, it will rule out the possibility of the Brazilian's return.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.
March Laar: EKRE members will not sit on the Board of the Bank of Estonia
EKRE members have not been and will not be invited to the board.
The composition of the Board of the Bank of Estonia determines the credibility of the Estonian state.
As long as EKRE members continue to behave in such a way that they first talk and then think, none of them will be invited to the bank's board.
"The Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Estonia cannot apologize for the statements made by the members of the Board," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, the ERR broadcasting portal reports.
Laar noted that EKRE is represented at meetings of the Board of Eesti Bank.
The current seventh Board of the Bank of Estonia is composed, in addition to Laara, of Liina Tynisson, Kaie Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Jaanus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Anne Listra and Rhein Minka.
According to Laar's proposal, two council members, Kallo and Tynisson, are to be replaced by Laar, replaced by Enna Esmaa (Centrist Party) and Ivari Padara (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Sutti to replace Jaanus Tamkivi on the council.
But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to win two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that, in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutti would also be on the board.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members to the Board of the Bank of Estonia.

How to boost your future pension without recycling
It is possible to pay a pension not only to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also to non-state pension funds.
NPFs are private companies, reports Volgogradskaya Pravda.ru.
They work like a deposit: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and over time returns the money to you with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NPFs on the website of the Bank of Russia.
All funds operate according to the same rules, which are established by federal laws.
Pension points can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of seniority you lack to qualify for a pension.
This method is suitable for those who have worked informally.
It is also possible to contribute for a relative, such as a housewife.
Advice for those thinking about retirement at the start of their working life.
Increased pensions are paid to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Far North.
In order not to give up anything once you reach retirement age, take care of it in advance.

Representatives of the mass media visited the fourth power unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
The video, taken in the control room of Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, appeared on the Internet, first published on YouTube by the video agency Ruptly.
It is noted that access to the fourth control room of the Chernobyl reactors was granted to a group of 15 representatives of the media as part of the presentation of a guidebook on the exclusion zone.
According to RT's Telegram channel, journalists were there in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the power plant destroyed by the explosion still emit radiation 40,000 times higher than normal.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant occurred on the night of 26 April 1986.
Twelve regions in Ukraine and 23% of Belarus were exposed to radiation pollution.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.
Recall that in July of this year, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree according to which a green corridor, open to tourists, appeared in the Chernobyl zone.
The ban on shooting has also been lifted in the exclusion zone.
Earlier, it was reported that the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was opened for tourists from the Belarusian side.
Organizers of the excursions emphasized that it is possible to get less radiation in a day in the zone than during a flight on an airplane.

The network has been debating for days whether rapper Goof is worthy of being the new "Bachelor."
He was also reminded of his many infidelities and trips with escorts, and even decided that in this way the musician wanted to be rehabilitated for the scandalous clip "Moscow," which received a record number of dislikes from listeners.
But the entire management of the TNT channel decided to stop all legal proceedings at once.
Goof will not be a new contestant on The Bachelor.
An official statement from the press service said that he was considered for the role, but in the end chose another candidate.

He's a real guy.
More respect for him.
I wish him the best of luck in the future.
He's a real guy.
When I hear such support from the fans, I just become abnormal in the cage.
It was very hard.

Was it a show?
Thank you.
And to those who said I was choking in the third round...

Ukraine, too, got
There has been a massive disruption to Facebook's operations in Europe.
Recall that before that, the social network "fell" on September 23.

Which club will take Pavel Mamaev, released on parole
Footballer Pavel Mamaev, who was released last week from a correctional facility on parole, will not return to Krasnodar Football Club.
The former midfielder of this club may soon sign a contract with FC Rostov, reports the Championship portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of "Rostov" and Mamayev are now in the final stage.
Presumably, the 31-year-old footballer's contract will be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sport-Express writes that a day earlier Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination at Dynamo Moscow, but the inspection did not take place because of "the uncertain situation in the club."
Krasnodar terminated its contract with Mamaev last week by agreement between the parties.
The midfielder has played for the Krasnodar club since 2014.
With the team, he won bronze at the Russian Championships twice.
Earlier, Mamaev played for Moscow's Torpedo and CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for the Russian national team, playing 15 matches.
Together with Zenit player Alexander Kokorin, Mamaev was serving a sentence for taking part in fights in central Moscow last October.
In mid-September, they were released from the penal colony on parole.
Zenit signed a new contract with Kokorin.
A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a trolley found in a rubbish heap
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, has been arrested on attempted murder charges after brandishing a samurai sword at his opponent in an argument over a cart found in garbage.
Curtis Miller, 54, was digging through a pile of rubbish near an empty house.
Todd Beavers, who was out for the evening walk, noticed.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the refuse.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could claim the trolley because he was the first to start digging in the garbage.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it toward his house.
Miller then took the samurai sword he had found in the same pile and pursued his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller grabbed the sword from the knife and began brandishing it in the direction of the carjacker.
Beavers told Miller that what happened was being videotaped.
After spotting the video, Miller fled but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Soon after, he saw an unknown woman enter his yard and take the trolley, shouting abuse.
Police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that a hedge fund manager attacked a stranger and wounded her with a sword in Hardiston, New Jersey.
In this way, he reacted to the fact that guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he was staying, did not allow him to smoke.
Riots on Three
The further away the "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protests, the more noticeable it disintegrates into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence of the "riot" itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on hold, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to charges being dropped.
The collapse of the case should encourage the public, but it is certain to leave the siloviki extremely irritated, whose efforts to fill the case with persons and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, Aleksei Minaylo, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder), was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later was rehabilitated: the FSR dropped the charges against him.
Minjailo was detained for almost two months, and several professional associations - historians, priests, and writers - intervened for him.
After that, only two defendants remained in the case for participation in mass riots (initially there were 13 defendants): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radzhabov, who the day before the court extended his arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a government official, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
Court convicts the author of a joke petition on Latvia's accession to the United States
The Vidzeme Suburb Court of Riga sentenced the author of a joke petition on Latvia's accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented Bartetsky on the court's decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way were collected on the site.
It is noted that criminal proceedings were initiated against Bartecki under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public incitement to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia."
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of an online petition on Latvia's accession to Russia received six months in prison.
A Japanese airliner made an emergency landing in Khabarovsk
Boeing, flying from Austria to Japan, made an emergency landing at Khabarovsk airport, TASS reports.
The airliner, owned by the Japanese company ANA, was carrying 206 people, including 12 crew members.
It is noted that there were no injuries.

Earlier, it was reported that the plane, flying from Zhukovsky airport near Moscow to Kyrgyzstan, made an emergency landing at Samara airport because of a sick child on board.
Russia's Interior Ministry proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has prepared amendments to the Law "On Police" in order to protect law enforcement officers from the spread of defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal regulatory legal acts portal, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from "the dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of defamatory information, including defamatory information."
Exactly how police officers are supposed to be protected from online defamation is not specified.
At the same time, the explanation to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already envisaged by the law on blocking posts that offend government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory memorandum, the amendments to the Law "On Police" should enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing "blatant disrespect for the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine in the amount of 30 to 300 thousand roubles is envisaged, and for the second violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Soon after, the Chudovsky District Court of Novgorod Oblast fined a local resident 30,000 roubles for having posted online "two records with information in an obscene form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect for society, the state, and the authorities exercising state power in the Russian Federation."
Mortgage rates cut deadline announced
Rates on housing loans in Russia will decrease until the end of 2019.
This was stated by Aleksandr Plutnik, General Director of the credit organization Dom.rf, Interfax reports.
As Plutnik noted at the board meeting at the Russian Ministry of Construction, most banks will carry out another round of mortgage rate cuts in the remaining months of the year, and the market average will reach 8.9 percent - the level envisaged by the national project "Housing and Urban Environment."
According to the passport of the project, the average mortgage rate should be 8.9 percent in 2019, 8.5 percent in 2021, and 7.9 percent by 2024.
The program aims to "provide affordable housing to middle-income families, including opportunities for purchase (they build with a mortgage at a rate of less than 8%)."
Earlier in September, it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, plans to carry out another reduction in rates on housing loans by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens is poorly understood.
Of the most famous, pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular disease and certain cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens include all legumes (soybeans are the most popular), hops, and flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such supplements cannot serve as a full-fledged substitute for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such supplements cannot be ruled out.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones may be reduced due to the fact that too many analogues enter the body from outside.
Veretennikov called for the revival of Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
Former striker of Rotor and the Russian national team, Oleg Veretennikov, joined the campaign to revive Kazakhstan's Zhenis.
The club from Astana, which in different years was called "Dynamo," "Tselinnik," "Astana" and "Zhenis," was dissolved in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"I learned about the campaign to revive the Zhenis football club, organized by its fans.
And he couldn't stay out of it!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
These have not been the best of times in terms of results and funding but I will never forget this club and its loyal supporters who have always been with the team!
The Munaitpasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal of my career, will always be remembered!
"The Wife" must be revived!
He has a huge history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and believe that the city authorities will return their home club! "wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.
The Bastion Complex launched an Onyx rocket in Chukotka
For the first time, the Ministry of Defense launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.
Onyx launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from its target, and 200 of them flew over land, a record for this type of missile.
About 10 warships and ships of the Pacific Fleet, as well as aircraft of maritime aviation, ensured the safety of firing, the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported.
Previously, the Bastion systems had never been used in Chukotka.
The Hydrometallurgy Center has named the right people's signs
In Russia, there are many folk traditions on which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometry Center, all signs that supposedly work have been checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, albeit in the short term.
According to Roman Vilfand, Scientific Director of the Hydrometallurgical Center of Russia, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be hot, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working feature is based on bird watching.
People often talk about swallows, if they fly low, it is usually to rain.
The explanation is simple - when the air humidity is high, the moshkar's wings get wet and the birds are forced to lower in order to hunt insects, TASS writes.
Different continents have their own characteristics.
Marmite Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated every year on February 2.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to watch the marmot climbing out of its burrow to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeast Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pollution hotspots were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first oil spills started coming in on September 2.
But each day through Thursday, their numbers, like the area covered, continued to rise.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
They all turned out to be identical, and it was crude oil that was involved.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were submitted for analysis, stated that their composition did not correspond to oil produced from fields in Brazil.
"This is thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks are cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it most likely got into the ocean current, "Rogerio Almeida, coordinator of the Union of Petroleum Workers of the States of Pernambuco and Para√≠ba, told Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of the practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast, conservationists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
In the meantime, experts from the Institute recommend tourists and locals to avoid oil spills and notify about all detected pollution hotspots.
Medvedev instructs to revise the operating standards of food service companies
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to revise sanitary and epidemiological rules and regulations for food service organizations.
They will also have to study the issue of the transition to the application of the requirements established by the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union in the organization of food services.
The agency's proposals should be submitted to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of Mr Medvedev's instructions following the results of the September 11 program "Dialogue" on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
In addition, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for conducting, from January 1, 2020, an experiment to limit control measures for food service organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy have until 11 November to submit to the government a bill with amendments to the Administrative Code on the application of an administrative suspension of activities for violation of requirements to the organization of food, as a result of which damage to health has been caused.
In addition, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Economy, Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to work out the issue of a gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that allows for the formation of a full-fledged diet of healthy nutrition.
Recall that the business community started talking about outdated norms of requirements after one of the cafes from the AnderSon chain was closed down.
The business community demanded the cancellation of existing SanPiN, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
Thirty-three agencies were included in the list.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and rules by 40 times by 2021.
Detectives are currently in possession of information about three thefts involving the detainee.
A man armed himself in the Skuratovsky microdistrict of Tula.
He stole batteries and automobiles from cars.
Of the two vehicles, VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107, the kidnapper took the batteries, presumably for further sale.
"And from another VAZ-2107 vehicle, for the same purpose, an intruder took away an automobile and a subwoofer," the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tula Region reported.
The thief probably intended to resell.
The 26-year-old unemployed man is currently in custody.
Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to make the draft law on a guaranteed pension product fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is fairly common around the world.
How timely its introduction is is another matter.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," said V. Matvienko.
According to the speaker, Russians cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system and the legislation governing it.
"Russia is a welfare state, and we are obliged to do everything to improve the amount of pensions and the social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be considered, responsible, and take into account domestic realities, "V. Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The Head of the Federal Council emphasized that if this initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) is to develop, several basic principles must be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) would be sent for approval.
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, a guarantee of the safety of citizens "long-term pension savings by the state, registration of citizens" savings accounts by the central administrator, tax exemptions for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have reached an agreement
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The news of the beloved superhero's departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to negotiate the rights to use it in franchise films.
This became known from a Sony press release, which states that the third instalment of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier, it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, which is why Spider-Man will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the movie character are owned by Sony.
She rented them out to Disney-owned Marvel movies.
As a result, Sony earned revenue at the box office, and Disney earned revenue from souvenirs and toys.
At some point, this reportedly stopped working for Disney, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Faughey said he was delighted.
It's amazing that Spider-Man's journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
He is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world, "his press release reads.
At the same time, Figi reminded that Sony is also creating its own movie universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"As it happens, he is the only superpower character to find himself in different movie universes.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises, "he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from The Wolf of Wall Street in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to get half of the box office proceeds from Spider-Man films, on the condition that both companies pay half of the production costs.
But that didn't suit Sony.
News of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many loyal fans.
Details of the new terms have not yet been released.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the agreement, but said, "We have worked together very well for the last four years, and our shared desire to continue to work together was commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We're excited to be able to move forward together. '
Avengers: Infinity War, which combined Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk, and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of global cinema, displacing Avatar in first place.

Riigikogu: Estonia wants to make climate targets for 2050 even more ambitious
Commission Chair Annelie Ott said the commission had held three hearings so far.
Experts, entrepreneurs and representatives of the Ministry of the Environment presented their vision for achieving carbon neutrality in Estonia.
"This review confirms that Estonia, together with other EU member states, is actively seeking opportunities to make the 2050 climate targets even more ambitious and to agree on ways to achieve them," Ott said.

It is necessary to take into account the social and economic impact of all the changes, "Sikkut stressed.
This autumn, the Riigikogu Commission for European Union Affairs launched a series of parliamentary hearings to prepare a decision with which Estonia will participate in the EU negotiations on climate targets for 2050.

Popular Ukrainian singer Oleg Vinnik, who starred in the # VsemWorld project with Russian stars who supported the Kremlin's policy towards Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, got into the base of "Peacemaker."
A message about this appeared on the official website of the base.
The description says that Vinnik became a participant in the Russian propaganda anti-Ukrainian action # VseumWorld, aimed at shifting responsibility for the war unleashed by Russia (the aggressor country) to Ukraine.
Recall that Vladimir Pozner, Mireille Mathieu (France), Alessandro Safina (Italy), Valeria, Soso Pavliashvili, Igor Krutoy, Zara, Tamara Gverdtsiteli, Denis Klaver, Valery Syutkin, Dmitry Malikov, Maksim Pokrovsky, Jana Poplavskaya, Maksim Averin, Ksenia Alferova, Nonna Grishaeva and others took part in the clip.
Most of the flashmob participants publicly support the Kremlin's aggressive policy.
Vinnik became the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
The singer's press service previously explained that the artist took part in the project in support of the International Day of Peace, which is celebrated on September 21, and did not change his patriotic position.
Recall that there was a wave of indignation online.
The video itself is called a mockery.
How can artists who have visited occupied Crimea, who support Putin's policy of waging war in Donbas, where people are dying almost every day, talk about peace?

The fighter of the mixed style has to be able to do everything - both to work in a rack, and to fight, and to work in orchestra seats.
The first round - only shock equipment in a rack.
The second round - only wrestling, thus time for carrying out reception in orchestra seats is limited to 30 seconds.
Third round - anything is allowed.
When will the first tournament be held by the rules that you came up with?
November 29.
On the undercard of our fight with Koklyaev.

Trade with Russia Is Not Just Tanks
Trade turnover between Russia and India could double due to the geopolitical situation.
This was reported by Manish Kumar, Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, at the V Anniversary Forum of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses of the SCO and BRICS member countries.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, "stressed the guest from Delhi.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of these are small and medium-sized businesses that cooperate with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we are not standing still, but developing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general only help us all to grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds $10 billion, but that figure could be doubled.
First and foremost, through new technologies in health care, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established the first contacts with modern centers of Russia.
For example, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We have signed a memorandum on the creation of systems in which we can build our modern business.
After all, entrepreneurship is not a whim, but a necessity.
We need a step toward economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will certainly do so, "the Indian industrialist stressed.
Recall that Ufa hosts the Forum of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses of the SCO and BRICS regions for the fifth time in a row.
From September 25 to 27, the forum was attended by more than 2,800 people from Russia and 31 other countries.
As part of his working trip to Tobolsk, Alexander Moore, Governor of Tyumen Region, took part in the grand opening of the Sokolovsky Water Depository after reconstruction.
Now its capacity is 25 thousand cubic meters per day.
Reconstruction of the water intake took place within the framework of the implementation of the federal project "Clean Water" under the national project "Ecology."
The authorities were helped by investors: Sokolov Water abstraction was another example of the use of a public-private partnership mechanism.
Tyumen Oblast has a unique experience of interaction between federal structures, regional authorities, local administrations and private investors in this area.
New artesian wells have appeared at the site.
Above them, pumping stations were built.
Water treatment and disinfection facilities have been reconstructed.
As a result, the Sokolov water intake will provide the residents of Tobolsk with quality drinking water.
Sokolovsky and Zhukovsky water intakes are planned.
Then Tobolsk will be able to switch completely to underground water sources.

Trump's conversation with Zelensky saw a "Russian footprint" in Congress
In the lower house of the US Congress, the Russian Federation has been accused of involvement in the scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The suggestion that "Russians" might somehow be behind the story was made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, MSNBC News reported.
"I believe that Russia contributed to this," the Democrat said, but declined to comment further.
Pelosi-led Democrats, who hold a majority in the House, had earlier announced impeachment proceedings against the president.
This came after an intelligence informant complained about Trump.
The informant suspected that, in a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump pressured his interlocutor to open a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, who could become Trump's running mate in a year's time.
The White House had to provide members of Congress and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

Expert reveals why it's worth giving up tea bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when brewing a tea bag in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles are released into the cup.
Food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News that sawdust particles can also be added to a bag of drinks.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the tea bag - the producer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it can end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in tea bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to give up drinking such a drink in favor of weight tea, which is sold in specialty stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of tea bags lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - such a drink will contain the least additives," the expert pointed out.

Regions offered to share secrets of business support
As the Parliamentary Newspaper learned, on September 27, Andrei Kutepov, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, with a proposal to express a position on the initiatives of the Federation's subjects to improve legislation in the area of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to forge interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on their existing business development and self-employment legalization programs, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions visited by senators identified the issue of the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programs in the whole country," Andrei Kutepov stated.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive experiences of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
Sharing information on good practices in the regions could give a boost to entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Economic Policy Committee, "the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, support programs for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are operating successfully in many regions of the country.
For example, in Vologda Oblast, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.
In Ivanovo Oblast, a business support system has been developed that provides for the implementation of the one-stop-shop principle through multifunctional centers.
In Krasnodar Krai, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives receive grants from the regional budget.
There is a cluster development center in Oryol Oblast.
Within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of Small and Medium-Sized Entrepreneurs," Amur Region provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-governmental co-working centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And a number of other regions are taking special measures to support youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed continue to be pushed out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, in order to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, Arkhangelsk Oblast has proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," as this "best corresponds to the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In Ivanovo Oblast, it is considered necessary to introduce amendments to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of dwellings, country houses, and physical training classes.
Bryansk Region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.
And in Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and areas of support for social entrepreneurship are advocated in the legal and regulatory framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," assured Andrei Kutepov.
Airline helped passengers avoid neighbours with crying children
Air carrier Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on an airplane, you can now find out where young children will be sitting.
Now you can avoid them if you want to.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers were able to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted proximity with young children.
The airline has launched a feature that allows you to track where children will sit.
When booking seats, passengers will be able to see an image of a child's head in seats occupied by children between the ages of eight days and two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies because of the possible inconvenience of crying can sit as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services were delighted with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago he was flying from New York to Doha and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing "adult-only flights," expressing a willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they will now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travel, because they do not find it pleasant to fly next to a crying child in a closed space.
Earlier, a woman travelling with an infant tried to appease fellow passengers on a Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each carrying a note of apology.
Has Oleg Tabakov's train appeared in the capital's subway?
If you regularly use the Kaluga-Riga line (as most Konkov residents do), there is a surprise waiting for you.
A new theme train, "The Great Russian Artist Oleg Tabakov," has been launched in the underground.
Every day, this registered train transports 10,000 people.

By the way, it is convenient to travel from Konkov to the performances that are being performed on the new stage of the theatre (it is located on Malaya Sukharevskaya Square, near the metro station Sukharevskaya).
As the press service of the Moscow Metro explained to us, "the exterior design of the thematic train uses images of fragments of stained glass windows from the new scene and includes portraits of Oleg Tabakov in iconic images he created in the theatre, cinema and animation."
The train tells about his family, the play "Sailor's Silence," with which the great life of the theatre began, about "Tabakerka" itself, and about his work as a director.
Rare archival photos and film footage can be seen on the walls of the carriages.
Russian gays with adopted children seek asylum in US
A same-sex couple of Russians with two adopted children have applied for asylum in the United States, RIA Novosti reports.
The men reportedly left the Russian Federation for Ukraine and then went to the States, where they applied for asylum.
According to a statement from the advocacy group Stimulus, the family's actions were motivated by "the ongoing interest of law enforcement."
The men reportedly have no plans to return to Russia.
From the beginning of the school year, children learn in American schools and adapt to the new environment.
Recall that earlier it was reported that a case had been opened against employees of the Department of Social Protection of the Population of Maryino District because of the adoption of two young boys by a same-sex family.
The HRC stated, however, that the raising of children by a same-sex couple should not in itself become a cause for legal action.

Pavel Ustinov joined pickets in support of the defendants in the "Moscow case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of one-man pickets "Freedom for All," which are being held on Friday at the Presidential Administration Building on Old Square in Moscow, Interfax's correspondent reports.
A series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and have continued every day since.
At present, the participants of the action stand in succession, holding a poster with the inscription "Freedom for all" and the names of those convicted and arrested after uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the poster features the names of Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aydar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minaylo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky, and Vladislav Sinitsa.
On September 16, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in an ordinary regime penal colony on charges of using violence against a member of the riot police of Rosgvarda at an uncoordinated rally on August 3 in the center of Moscow (Article 318 (2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
Then, on September 20, at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office, the court changed Ustinov's preventive measure from detention to a travel ban.
Thus, a petition for Ustinov's release gathered more than 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
Theatre and film artists started a flash mob in support of their colleague.
To participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18, a line was formed in the Old Square.
Human rights activists, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors, and Orthodox priests demanded a review of the case.
As Ustinov's sister Yuliya told Interfax, her brother does not plan to speak at the rally on September 29 in the capital in support of the defendants in the "Moscow case."
Supplies of "sanctions" to Russia have fallen by a factor of 100
The Russian government estimates that the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than a factor of 100 since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This refers to the supply of goods that are not subject to the embargo.
According to the report, the volume of products banned for import was compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the order to destroy the sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein "joined" this list, and on January 1, 2016, Ukraine.
A decree signed by Putin to destroy illegally imported "sanctions" (food products that fell under a food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian Western sanctions) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" foodstuffs by any legal means.
As Western sanctions continued, Russia also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, Head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, earlier called the destruction of food "simply immoral," and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the education of people.
Moreover, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of foodstuffs fit for consumption.
The Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation then made a similar recommendation to the government.
And Alexei Gordeev, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, stated that it is wrong to destroy food products, and one should think about how they can be used for their intended purpose, having assessed the quality.
Head of firm found guilty of tax evasion
Vyacheslav Morozov, Director of Land and Law LLC, was found guilty by the Leninsky District Court of Cheboksary of committing crimes under Article 199 (2) (b) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (evasion of taxes from an organization by including in a tax return knowingly false information, committed on a particularly large scale) and Article 327 (2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (forgery of an official document granting rights and relievading duties, for the purpose of its use, committed in order to conceal another crime and facilitate its commission).
This was reported by the press service of the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee for Chuvashia.
From January 2008 to December 2009, Vyacheslav Morozov entered information about imperfect transactions into LLC tax records.
According to fictitious documents, the company incurred additional costs and, consequently, the amount of value added and corporate income taxes payable was reduced by 11.2 million roubles.
Vyacheslav Morozov received a suspended sentence of 3.5 years in prison.
By 2023, the first school of a new format will open in the center of the capital
A new type of school will be opened in Khamovniki.
According to the head of Moskomstroyinvest, Anastasia Pyatova, all conditions will be created there for the self-realization and development of children's talents.
The educational institution was decided to be called "New Look."
This project will be overseen by the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foundation for Higher School Economic Development.
It is planned to start designing the building with an area of about 10 thousand square meters as early as next year.
The construction will be completed at the end of 2022, and the first students will be recruited as early as the next year.
"The project envisages the creation of a public, non-profit educational space, which will be based on the traditions of a classical Moscow school and experimental methods," noted the press service of Moskomstroyinvest.
Chile starts construction of ‚Ç¨1 billion telescope
This was reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week construction officially began on the dome of the building that will house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) telescope, by far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomy project.
Its total cost, according to ESO estimates, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-large mirror, which will have a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT obtain the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's twin.
In addition, scientists will try to use the observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Although construction of the dome has just begun, the mirrors, scientific tools, and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers, and other specialists for three years now - since the first plans for the E-ELT were announced.
Germany's SCHOTT and France's Safran Reosc were awarded the contract for the production of the main mirror, with a combined value of around ‚Ç¨400 million.
