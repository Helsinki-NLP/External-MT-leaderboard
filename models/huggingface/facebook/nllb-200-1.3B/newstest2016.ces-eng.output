On the emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed to come to their home.
Lamb determined that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could make it up to you, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me", according to the letter, which Lamb signed, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would have driven 300 miles to the campus where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard gunshots at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details released by state investigators and students and staff who knew him have collectively created a picture of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in thanks to the "great people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there was a tendency to trouble.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was experiencing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, saying he had a problem.
And he's only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment process meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked hard to obtain would not have guaranteed him an automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge stated that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was apparently troubled".
These are questions Lamb can't answer.
After he left campus, police tracked him across the Arkansas state line back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb committed suicide with a single gunshot to the backyard of his parents' home about a mile from the Mississippi suburb of Greenville, Washington, coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car started on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and education classes.
He got his doctorate in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who taught her how to play guitar for a few years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls' hearts went out to him", says Hairston, now 40, who lives in suburban Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was never any record of the marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19.
"She was completely devastated", O'Steen said of her daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but he knew from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were performing at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a brightly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, after Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica for a countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple", he said.
We'd flirt and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the professor killed, was a first-year seminarian specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married with three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student Club and Student Government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, some 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight vigil.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
School started again on Wednesday.
"We try to get our students back", LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis have filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans, also contributed to this story.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made the emergency call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers the chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting this month, and will recruit employees through October and December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help in stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, when I realized the seat next to me was empty and it occurred to me that Princess Diana was going to be sitting there", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The movie starts and I realize I'm in the middle of what could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" is a documentary about "Back to the Future" featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really, to me, arguably the best travel documentary ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterated his urgent call for all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation insoluble".
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in reaching the Iran nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
Eight election numbers that show that Donald Trump, in the real light,
Some have tried to characterize him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands over it as if it was a bad joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to do to take Donald Trump off the ballot, they're not doing it.
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump leading by double digits, and some people are starting to seriously question what that means for the nomination chances of this real estate mogul.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership gave Herman Cain a path to the top, ultimately neither of them winning a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might be a contender in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth are realizing Trump's will to survive and are starting to pour their dollars into the stand to bring him down.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing fad:
Trump's approval rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view of it.
And these numbers are in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac University poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "outraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "dismayed" if business favorite Jeb Bush were to run.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as the problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll Monday.
The same number is held at the Iowa State Senators Club, which is the first in the nation where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
When asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 people bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
This time last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have rallied around another candidate, Trump will still defeat almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the split field is likely contributing to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll from early September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always win the majority.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Chris by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would have led the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters claim they've already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump voters say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they'll never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for change among candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final are twice as likely to go to the polls to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans are reportedly in agreement with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violent" in his campaign announcement, immigration has remained the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear Trump's hubris will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
It seems as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently getting about half the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll Monday say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "hell-angry".
The House has backed a larger share of the state's coal tax.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The House of Representatives supported at first reading the Government amendment to the Upper Law, which regulates the amount of the levy on surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mladek (ČSSD) promised MPs that this would bring extra money to both the state treasury and the municipalities' budgets.
The bill was criticized by opposition lawmakers who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, as they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget. The House supported in the first reading the government's amendment to the upper law, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger share of the fees from surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the municipalities' share will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The template also changes the way in which remuneration is calculated for the minerals that companies extract.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring 427 million crowns more into the state treasury than in 2013.
The government claims that the tax is to have a neutral impact on the revenue of the municipalities' budgets, as the charge is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
The municipality received about 200 million crowns and the State 66 million crowns from the extraction of brown coal.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration of occupied land with permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall remain fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities would benefit from the scheme by earning between 14 million and 100 million crowns annually instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its own decree.
The remuneration shall be recalculated as the product of the quantity of ore extracted and the rates for each type of ore.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the imposition of a fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister, however, this is not a tax, because the state charges a tax on the mineral, which is state property.
Only the municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining activity receive the fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money goes to the municipality and one-fourth to the state.
The same ratio will apply to the extraction of radioactive rock.
The part of the money collected by the State from the extraction fees will be assigned to a specific purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mining rescue service.
The bill was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would damage mining-affected municipalities and regions.
For example, Michal Kucherera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the finance minister can improve the budget", said David Kádner (Usvit), elected in the Usteck region.
The increase in unemployment in Mostecka was warned by KSČM MP Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucher wanted to return the law to the government for finishing.
The explanatory memorandum states that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the coal prices, since more than 90% of the prices are negotiated in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not be affected by the price increase.
'On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,' the Government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in fees is tolerable from the point of view of employment.
The rapporteur on the Milan Urban amendment (CSSD) said it was crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits on coal mining before the law is passed.
If the limits are exceeded, it will have an impact on the state and local revenues, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak army mine should be made after 2020.
The limits on the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability reasons.
Cheerful will lead the Czechs as the number one, deploying weather-influenced.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at Thursday's Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them is likely to intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load over the whole quartet due to the difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so we expect tough matches that can last up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out by the weather.
And depending on how it looks, he said back at today's Czech training at the Raj Kumar Khanna Center.
With the first team and the world's top 40, George Vesely is counting on Friday and Sunday doubleheader.
In position two, Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are probably ahead.
I'd like to get almost everyone involved.
"I'm thinking about it, but I'm not going to say it yet", said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech team should be the participation of Štěpánk in Saturday's foursome.
It's just a question of who's gonna stand next to the experienced douchebag who's got an 18-4 four-game Davis Cup balance.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are still options with Roso or Adam Pavlas.
"I really don't know with whom or what it will look like", he said.
It's a two-game series.
The variant may be Pavlasek, who surprised Vesely in the first round with a win in the relay over the Australians.
"He's a decent fellow", said the returning.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same performance I did there from the second set.
"I'm glad for the experience and I'd like to bring a point", said Pavlasek.
The home team will enter Yuki Bhambri in the doubles (125) who won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth ranked players.
The second is Somdev Devvarman (164th).
They're both challenger players, and our guys have experience on the ATP Tour, but we've seen it many times before that the Davis Cup rankings don't decide.
"It determines the form of the moment, the weather", said the Returner.
Friday's opening two-game series starts at 6:30 CET and may be delayed due to weather.
The weather forecast says it's gonna rain, and the jacket's not under the roof.
However, it may be played with artificial lighting.
They've already burned it, and it's about two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights", he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will be making his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQ has been highly anticipated.
New chief of staff Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut on Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he will be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely scrutinized by the media and MPs.
In his weekly statement, he called for "less theater and more facts".
He also mentioned that he might skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, coming after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech Tuesday to the TUC annual convention.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the singing of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been criticised by a number of Conservative MPs and has been the focus of several headline stories.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in reverential silence" and acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, citing differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences at work are also "squatting" after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's benefit cap.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Shadow Secretary for Work and Pensions, said the party had "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP argues that the PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "casual responses" and "dental trade", and instead pledges to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he is not attending, as for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting his colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he was told he was still discussing the matter with Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but admitted years later that it had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of the judgement of leaders, their leadership of the House and their standing among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

Libra rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The Libra jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led upwards by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, the UK's profits, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest rate since 2009 and it looked like the estimates of when rates would rise were getting closer.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was 0.84% above the euro at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after receiving a close bid from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Glencore's stock rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn using a shared placement as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in the Mondi paper and packaging group were the biggest drop on the index, falling 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating of the firm to "for sale".
JD Sports is up 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in pre-tax profits in the first half of the year. £46.6m.
JD Sports's boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it's unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could interfere with JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The Prague apartment blockers are yawning marshmallows.
The controversial building has been put on hold.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
A hundred people protested in front of the Prague 1 office, and a petition was created against the construction of the building near the Anežský Monastery in the center of Prague.
The decision of the Magistrate found that the construction law had been breached because all the details of the territorial decision had not been complied with.
'The subject matter of the territorial decision does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from adjacent buildings, the sufficiently clear and comprehensible description of the shape of the building, the delimitation of the area affected by the construction', it says.
The Magistrate also considers it unlawful that some of the documents for the decision were issued to the original documentation, which has been changed.
It is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have her valid consent.
However, the documentation shows that the landlord has only given his consent to the project documentation for the land management, not to the construction of the building on his land, the building regulations state.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetta, of the investment firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the supervisory authority, the Ministry of Local Development, that the deadline for the initiation of the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions involved", Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people nickname marshmallow because of the supposedly designed façade color, is causing strong emotions in Prague.
In the city center, hundreds of people have gathered in the past to protest against the construction.
The association and the residents of nearby houses are upset that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historic center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anežský Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original design of the project in 2008, which included a glazed facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monuments Institute (NMU) and the permit for Prague monuments was revoked in 2010.
The new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPU and the municipal authorities and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the criticism of opponents, saying he never expected a pink facade, which gave the project its nickname after the pink-white candy.
The Czech politician took the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into their car, and they said they wanted to take them for about a half-kilometer.
He said that at the time, it was not a crime in Hungary.
We knew law enforcement didn't do that.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested and taken to the detention center in Szeged, to our surprise.
The politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police were reportedly behaving properly, but communication was hampered because they did not speak English well.
But he found prison to be a sad place.
For example, our cell, measuring about 10 by 10 feet [3 by 4 m], was packed with 15 Syrian refugees.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people had been there for two days, and because of the language barrier, none of them had any idea what was going to happen to them, Berg said.

Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's assault in South and Western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are joining brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29th, when the food, liquor and hardware vendor celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - over 30% in SA and 24% in WA compared to around 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take over 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, which will take over revenues from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base could cost Metcash around USD 13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly comment on Douglass's comment.
But it's known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and revenues from the grocery store Metcash, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have moved to counterattack and are investing more than $150 million a year to match the counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and novelty from private individuals.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that price matching and store closures will catch up and hopes that wholesale will return to basic earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for her behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a by-product of the recent uproar over her friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for her behavior, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks", attracted unwelcome attention for his affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifier in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka was supposed to give Kyrgios one, and I was supposed to give him one too".
While last seen breaking a racket after a cramp caught him in a possible overtime by Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakise was a staunch defender of Healy.
Young is currently in Glasgow, where he is vying with Sam Groth for a place in the second leg behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensively about the fact that I think Thanasi was a little bit involved in the whole thing", Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost to a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to vent his anger on his racket out of frustration with himself.
But he's really been very good at it, because he's been exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits in the team great and so on, he's never had any problems with the other players, he's very respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to skip Kyrgios for the important match that starts on Friday, stating that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but he supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term starter.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has been created around him [Kyrgios]", Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people have pointed out, in the public eye, he's rising very quickly, he's also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the sun where he can think about it, I think is the best solution for the team and for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detain migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos broke out at the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in the no man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted angrily.
Those who are stuck for an indefinite period on the land between two states are those who are fleeing violence in their native countries, building tents and settling down.
But there's frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants shout "Open the borders!" and insult the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirectly harmful.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,' says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprise Italy and Greece, and spoke of hoping to reach an eventual agreement next month or by the end of the year that would see the EU nations accept more than 120,000 additional refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called a special EU summit for Tuesday to discuss the continent's refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes in Brussels or its neighbours.
The threat situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize breaching the four-metre fence the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provide for longer prison terms for those who transfer refugees illegally.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already been caught on state territory.
They broke through by damaging the fence and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered in barbed wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos ensued as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal processing container and there was a push of people.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary by denying them food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in the national polls.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will run for president, is receiving support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
With more than five months before the main race begins, the most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they're clear on which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton is keeping a big lead among women and is softening, but her leadership is shrinking.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton's lead with the Democrats under 50 has evaporated and now they're on a par with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only five points behind her in that group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the states say they'd be enthusiastically supportive of Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her simply because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
I guess it's no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The high probability of elections and agreement on issues is also cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential run for president, 57 percent of the Democratic primary voters would like him to run -- a third think he shouldn't run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked who they would pick as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most frequent choice was Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half put Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will expand from 20 points when Biden is running to 30 points without him running.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is second by far on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely candidate is increasing.
However, when it comes to the issue of the importance of a candidate, Democratic voters prefer problem-solving to a better chance of getting elected.
As in last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is standing as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, do well in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads the way in all three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so about him.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their ideological views.
On all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most Democratic primary voters are happy with her explanation of the matter, saying it hasn't affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, it's a different story altogether.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided as early as March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party's voters, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump both have good leadership grades.
Of the six candidates tested, the honesty leaders were Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
Two candidates account for half the votes in the latest poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a landslide, climbing from 23 percent in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent on Tuesday.
But Carson shot up from 6 to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well across demographics, eliminating Trump from the college-educated Republican voter pool.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on the verge of dropping from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the most recent poll is plus minus 6%, and it was taken in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improving to 19% support among Republicans against Trump's 32% support.
A recent poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In the midst of the Carson trend, Trump decided to blindly shoot a retired neurosurgeon, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump declared last Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the commencement ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then collapsed.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and basically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's life", said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't revive him and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit with a blunt object in the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternity overload, and at least one student has died every year from overload since 1970", writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury has recommended a charge of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to not only arrest the people involved, but if there is an organization that approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well", Wagner said at a Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the National Brotherhood has severed its relationship with local chapters.
This is going to happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
The rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna take.
For economics specifically, it offers a little story of timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Fed's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant of how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That's why Fed officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike will begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market participants can be assured that all the excitement about the speed increase may be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to the more conventional, but still low, levels to create the seismic shock that many might fear.
That means there's going to be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how certain sectors of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the last month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend toward a re-stop 12-24 months after the first raise, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy", said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's raise.
More precisely, the market has most often - over the last 35 years or so - moved to relatively flat rates in 250 days (an average increase of 2.6%) and then returned to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return starts to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help it.
At the moment, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not existed before and that could hasten a recession.
Most remarkably, GDP is near its lowest point in history when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, nominal annual GDP growth was below 4.5% only twice.
Although it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to hold, when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Fed.
The Commission also notes that the Commission's analysis of the situation in the Union is not sufficient to establish whether the measures in question were compatible with the internal market.
Market participants have been prepared for the Fed's growth all year, and all eyes are on the Federal Free Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the upward cycles so far have been in a super-cycle of leverage upward with GDP masking the early peak of the recession very quickly after the initial recovery", the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're at 74 months and we're still going.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more readily seen on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first entry of the up/down cycle.
At the end of the cycle of growth, bond yields fall immediately", said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate increases will bring the yields between long- and short-dated bonds closer, smoothing out the curve.
High-yield bonds often do better in this climate, even though "we are still wary of tightening yields", said Kathy Jones, a firm-fixed-retirement analyst at Schwab, in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spread has widened, and volatility has increased -- all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightened policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt will fare worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that stock 'quality' tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High return on equity companies, as well as low volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with high floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond pure stock-play, consumers are also benefiting from a rising dollar.
Savers may also see their gains through higher returns, but experts have differing opinions on how long this will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "screwing up"
It considers that it is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitor
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating the British
Damien Collins, MP, has attacked the Voice, saying that he himself is not the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, says a leading MP, and is putting fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasting is not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service broadcaster appeared to be "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "stupid" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM", he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which opened in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be the British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that come to mind, where you're actually just mimicking what we already have on the market", Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO rejected the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I couldn't have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important", he says.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, the regulator of BBC Radio 3, argued that it was now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before, because the British were less educated when it came to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sport broadcasts and to get a commission hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC has bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
You see why this program is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in a "typical BBC manner".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it next launches a comedy series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending royalties' money on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase of 7% in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago by mobile shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could be a reason for the slowdown in spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, turning many of Britain's main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of a stabilisation of online sales, with new data showing a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure in August represented the lowest increase since the start of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared with the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of a stabilization in online sales, with new data showing a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels over the years and go back to 2000, it's always been rationalized over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, tells the Guardian.
It explains that internet sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, like on the couch.
But now it's stagnating somewhat, so it seems to be fading.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was hijacked from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers may be reluctant to shop ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the last year, five times as many shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and matched several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows shoppers to buy again, may deter customers from making further purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than in fashion stores.
Muslims bury crane crash victims in Mecca and Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims in the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has blamed the collapse of the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group in part.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, and the bodies were carried down the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, mourners chose their path and paid homage to the victims as the first of the fallen made their final journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
Sad news passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and plunged onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family construction team over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after a crane collapsed at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend on the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The British disco agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's executives were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are converging for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statement on the crane collapse and its representatives were not made available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, running large construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade who was disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The crash happened amid heavy winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must undertake at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be given to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q's boss says Eastern European merchants working for cheap aren't the trend anymore
The British are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is beyond the point of growth
The result is 200 Screwfix stores open for merchants.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
It was edited by Rupert Steiner, the chief correspondent for the Daily Mail.
The British are said to be putting away their hammers and brushes and handing them over to the hired trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their homes
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you're in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do their home crafts, according to the head of Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home appliance chain, says that the large increase in trained Eastern European merchants offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix retail stores, and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury says she wants to hire more women at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions at the store are made by better half.
Today, most of the workers are male.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends that showed more women households doing more home improvements than in the past.
Says Laura: "Most of the shops we work in are still man-made.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of the purchasing decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, one of only five women at the helm of the UK's FTSE100, has also restructured her senior team to reflect the equality between male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the female workforce, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both mid-year earnings and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
The result of the trend is that Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
The December pension contribution of 600 crowns is in jeopardy.
"It's justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice", said TOP 09 Vice President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
The Chairman of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura noted that although a one-off contribution sounds good, in the long term it would be better to have it in standard valuation, as it would be reflected in subsequent years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do it", Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (CSSD), according to which the next year was to be valorized beyond the law.
Marx defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she did not consider to be rosy.
She says the higher valuation next year would have a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns and the ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) reminded the right that the pace of valorization has decreased in the past.
The Commission has also proposed a new Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.
The veto of the right to pay in December will make it significantly more complicated and possibly impossible, he said.
The chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed to shorten the deadline for the discussion of the standard in the committee to 10 or 20 days, even this was blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should total 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should rise by an average of about 100 crowns.
The contribution should be paid to persons who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December, according to the pension reform.
It could also be granted to those whose entitlement to a pre-payment pension expired in December.
However, they would have to make a written request for the supplement by the end of the following year at the latest.
In the Czech Republic, pensions are regularly valued in January, by an increase in prices and a third of the increase in real wages.
This year, the pension is 41.5% of gross wage, next year it should be 40.5%.
According to the State accounts, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more per year.
The expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
According to the State accounts, the average full old-age pension increased last year by 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned his political plans and is now pursuing a career in science.
The billionaire's Senate seat was almost certain, according to Russian media.
He was to represent the Kaliningrad region of Western Russia in the Federation Council, where Governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party, was overtly defending his position in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the people, but chosen by the governor from among three candidates whose names are announced before the gubernatorial election.
After the election, he'll choose a senator from three candidates.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has made an exception for Yakunin, who is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Tiger's Theory is over.
The final straw in the protagonist's resolve is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janjurova decided about Grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife, Olga-Eliska Balzer, are on a similar path.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, and he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the past, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to comically capture a certain type of relationship where one partner doesn't feel completely free.
It was clear from the beginning that the lead roles would go to Bartosz, with whom he had already worked on the series Invisible.
Yet, he was surprised by an actor who appeared in front of the camera after a long break from recovering from a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad it was.
And I was surprised that he's apparently a keen athlete.
He used to ask where he was going to sit before he shot the next scene.
This time he rode a bicycle, climbed rocks, and even walked up a hill.
And all in record-breaking tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartocha, women take a tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll pour him some food, but they'll close the door so he doesn't think of playing tiger outside the rabbit shop.
And that's what we're trying to tell in our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who can be slightly negative to viewers, was played by Eliska Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, intelligent, empathetic, and means well.
But she's also a usurper and wants to roast her husband to death, Bajgar pointed out.
The film also describes the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tanja Vilhelmova and Pavla Bereta - and the sons-in-law of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Rozhlas and TV Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet company Google has pledged up to $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday at Google.org, the charity arm of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of Telic's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP Pavel Telička postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
Baku, according to Telicka, justifies this by the EP resolution of last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan, and which Telicka co-authored.
The decision of the Azerbaijani party deprived Telicka of the opportunity to meet with official partners and also of visiting political prisoners, which is subject to the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
The trip, which was planned months in advance, was intended to be used by Telička to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the CTC clarified.
The resolution condemns "the unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent verdict of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who campaigned to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia is not ruling out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, during his visit to Novosibirsk, did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he declared.
Russia has a long-standing naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has used as a service and logistics center.
But according to Russian press reports, since the beginning of August, Russian arms and military equipment have been shipped to Syria.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments under existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains a stronghold for Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, their third phone call in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to explain his concerns about the buildup of Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said Russia's policy goals in Syria were rather vague.
He says Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, but what it is, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in New York, according to Russian press speculation today.
On the other hand, the Russian leader is reportedly reluctant to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to a report in The New York Times today, the U.S. government is not ruling out that President Barack Obama and the Russian president could meet during a U.N. meeting.
But the White House's advisers are reportedly divided.
TASS today, citing Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said that Putin has not yet met with Obama on his New York trip.
Use sesame oil on your bile diet, hemp helps boost your immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When cold pressing the seeds, all the healthy substances in the oil remain.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder diets.
Some extra virgin oils are good for preventing cardiovascular disease.
According to the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics, these are the most common cause of death among Czechs for several years.
Gallstones are a problem for women, and sesame oil helps.
If you are an Asian food lover, you should not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can be used in the heating of food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in bile diets.
The essential fatty acids it contains are good for preventing gallstones.
They're 90% of the cause of gallstones, and women are three times more likely to suffer from these conditions than men.
In general, gallbladder problems are particularly common in overweight people who do not exercise and who consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can also be used successfully in a liver diet, which is very similar to the bile diet.
If people want to enjoy all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of the exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use roasted seeds, which have a more distinct flavor, for pressing.
But the oil will lose all its active ingredients, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsk, which produces cold-pressed bio-virgin oils.
The company is also developing sesame oil, using only unroasted white sesame seeds.
Our press can squeeze out eight kilos of sesame in an hour.
The raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees Celsius by mechanical pressing and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin label.
The higher temperatures would cause nutrient loss.
Sunflower oil is good for heart and vascular disease.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Research by Jarmilla Hamerská, who led the Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, as it starts to reheat at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to flavor salads and is particularly suitable in the diet, where it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It is rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which are the most cholesterol-lowering of all fatty acids.
If you have heart problems, you should be careful about your total fat and calorie intake.
For example, a tablespoon of sunflower oil has 62 calories, a tablespoon of canola oil has 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of the industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life even further.
People recognize old oil primarily by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no flue at the bottom of the fault.
It's a sign that the substance hasn't been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are considered superfoods, and hemp oil is considered the healthiest of all vegetable oils.
This is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be obtained from food.
Of particular importance is the intake of omega-3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is appropriate to include in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and to heal wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using hemp oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Olej is one of the best-selling in society.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoonful on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not particularly flavorful, but it does a great job of boosting immunity, advised Daniel Wolcek of the Krzysztof company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecuers is the United States.
That's 1.4 grills for every household.
Worldwide, there are various barbecue competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There's no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives have never smoked.
And most of them barbecue a few times a year.
To make grilling a success, the preparation should not be underestimated - it is ideal to marinate the meat several hours before heat treatment.
What oil is best for this purpose and will leave a healthy residue when grilled?
In general, the grilling process itself should be fat-saving.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body's nutrients that we otherwise get from eating oils from foods that are processed at lower temperatures.
That doesn't mean that extra virgin oils don't work in barbecue.
A terrific oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, the experts at Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk immediately think of grape oil.
It is a wonderful complement to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it has the unique property of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, it is one of the few oils that retains its health benefits, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from the company Bohemia Olej, which is one of the few Czech producers of this oil from grape vines.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid, making it effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
Grape oil also provides our body with important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.
Thanks to its beneficial content, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism, and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Grape oil also helps to enhance our appearance - it improves skin elasticity, is used to treat acne, and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for preparing cold dishes, such as salad dressings, but also for the thermal preparation of dishes.
So, there are two ways to use it in grilling, marinating and grilling.
Marinating meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we add apple cider vinegar to make the meat softer.
Spices add flavor to the meat, and oil preserves and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Wolfe.
He also adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate through dark meat.
So, marinated meat or fish is ready to be grilled, how do we proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare dishes.
Same goes for barbecuing.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oils, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil to prevent food from burning.
Preparation of the attachments is also an essential part of the grilling.
Practically anything goes with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad, and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Olei recommend, for example, the Hot Summer salad.
For this you need: • 1 tbsp. of peaches • 1 bundle of scrambled eggs • 1 cup of sliced cucumbers • 1 cup of salad dressing • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a chopped handkerchief, chopped cucumbers, and a peach chopped into large cubes.
You can also taste it with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, dip a few drops of grape oil.
Then, for a special flavor, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the medication that matters, it's the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person diagnosed with it needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
It is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation if they decide to have a child, care for these patients includes social and legal advice, recommendations for housing adjustments, etc.
However, this is not enough: the development of the disease can be significantly influenced by the patient himself.
The more actively he fights the disease, the longer he can work and the less he will have to make any major changes in his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick leaves room for disease activity.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to greatly delay the time when a patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and those around them not be subjected to myths, such as that their illness automatically leads to their being in a wheelchair.
This is why the website Give Yourself a Chance (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a person with multiple sclerosis is the neurologist.
The proverb about multiple sclerosis is twofold: The sooner the disease is treated, the more likely it is that the doctor can make a difference.
That's because we have drugs for MS in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process isn't quite as strong yet.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the chance of stopping the disease and delaying its disabling effects, explains Dr. Eva Medová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often addresses weakness of the lower limbs or imbalances.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders, or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient", says Dr. Martina Kövári, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
Although people with multiple sclerosis have the same disease, each person has a slightly different manifestation of the disease.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always ease its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the body's immune system, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is that it helps patients to test their abilities, which increases their confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins and makes you feel good", notes Dr. Kamila Rassová of the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic at the Royal Hospital of Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we're affecting the limbic system, which is responsible for emotions.
It's how we intervene in the psyche and the immune system and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously these patients were so-called self-screened, now we know that they need targeted care", says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Exercise Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The aim of physical therapy is to keep a person self-sufficient for as long as possible, including employment.
Physical therapists work with occupational therapists to provide each person with a compensatory aid tailored to his or her needs.
Many patients also need the attention of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a tough situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shocked.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a big burden - the loss of health.
With a soul this sick, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to carry it all on our own.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a disability, one can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis is not the end of life", says psychotherapist Renata Malinová-Schubert of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without Latecoere, the Prague manufacturer, the airbuses would not fly.
Aerospace is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New planes are full of titanium or lightweight, solid composite materials that no one can make and process right away.
Yet, besides super-precise, computer-controlled machinery, besides the autoclaves for forming composites, you can come across something as simple as a meringue oven.
In a drum resembling a cotton-sugar pot, the edges of tin pieces that have just come out of the mill are rubbed together in a pile of ovens.
"Nobody has come up with anything better", smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the Czech manufacturer of flight doors Latecoere.
At the Prague facility in Letňany, the former Fotov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They're the only ones in the world supplying doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also allow passengers to enter first and upper class on the upper decks of the world's largest commercial aircraft, the Airbus A380.
They're also assembling a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Like the company has the keys sorted twice a year.
If the yellow label was missing a check record, they would have to explain it to the auditors at the Prague plant from Airbus or Boeing, who regularly check that the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1,500 knots on one door of the A320.
The gunners have to unlock them manually.
It takes them two days.
Even the sound of a hammer when it hits the net will tell if the net has been properly untied.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The wire may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0,13 mm.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
The check will involve a trained touch.
When the controller passes his finger over a series of nuts, he can tell if any are out of tolerance.
Then he'll pick up the accurate deflector.
Before 1989, the L-39 was a military training aircraft.
But by 1991, none were made.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
At that time, it was partnering with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It won the tender for the supplier of the A321 emergency doors.
Negotiations with Boeing have not been so happy.
"We were a small company to them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing stable long-term supplies", recalls Dubsky.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained closed if Letov had not attracted the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Association of the Aviation Industry in 1999.
I was talking about our partnership with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, says Dubsky.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with the strong company.
As early as 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the A380's upper deck doors were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for the delivery of Boeing Dreamliners.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't have gotten these big deals ourselves.
Maybe we'd make parts or small parts.
The partners want a 20 or 30 year supply guarantee, explains Dubski.
Last year, Latecoere in the Czech Republic achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers' suppliers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1,5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't be making any doors for planes.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of the customers and maintaining them in repeated checks costs millions of crowns, according to Dubski.
The production processes change every year.
They're more precise and strict.
We need to train the staff, get the equipment and re-certify the whole process, adds Dubski.
Now the company is finishing a process for coating zinc and nickel to replace the previously harmful cadmium.
They got the assignment from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing are coming, checking the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're checking our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their lab and then compare the results to ours, approximating Dubsky's way of controlling the customers.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague firm.
With the Prague plant, the production of embraers is up and down.
It produces half of the total door volume for the A320.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
That doesn't mean he can ask any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It tells you how much one door will cost for 10, 50, 100 pieces made.
The price per piece is always falling to a certain limit.
We have to fit into this pricing pattern.
If not, we'll lose, says Dubsky.
Half the hall where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are being completed is empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic line is being built behind the curtain to mount and trim doors for the upgraded A320 Neo.
The use will be accelerated and more precise.
"This is a trend that is taking the edge off assembly in aviation", adds Dubski.
Sales has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3,278 new A320s so far.
Just a few metres away, a line will be built for the complete installation of the A380's upper deck doors.
It's a strategic decision by our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, Dubsky says.
However, before that, the company must pass qualification tests, for example for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the doors of the largest Airbus.
The company also intends to further develop the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company to be able to process not only metal materials but also composites", says Dubsky proudly.
However, latecoere is reaching the production capacity limit in the Czech Republic.
There's no more room at the Letov compound where he's based.
Before the French mother came in, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and in three years it could have 100 more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing outpace the hundreds of new airplanes airlines order every year, they don't have to worry about jobs.
Despite having contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay the September loan payments.
Finally, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
She traded some of their loans for stock at the end of August.
The creditors acquired a 37,4% stake in the company by raising the capital by EUR 57,4 million.
The company's debt has fallen by two thirds, i.e. by EUR 180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed new shares to existing shareholders for EUR 222,9 million.
In total, it raised the share capital by EUR 280 million.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85% of sales.
It expects the average order volume to grow by 4% per year until 2017.
It has orders in the order book of EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the drip.
The Czech race in the Prague Summer is significant for the groups.
It contributes 16% of the group's turnover.
It is the largest foreign subsidiary of the group in terms of number of employees.
Members of Parliament have supported a larger share of the state's coal tax.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring 427 million crowns more into the state treasury than in 2013.
The government claims that the tax is to have a neutral impact on the revenue of the municipalities' budgets, as the charge is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
The municipality received about 200 million crowns and the State 66 million crowns from the extraction of brown coal.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration of occupied land with permitted mining to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall remain fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities would benefit from the scheme by earning between 14 million and 100 million crowns annually instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its own decree.
The remuneration shall be recalculated as the product of the quantity of ore extracted and the rates for each type of ore.
According to the Government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the imposition of a fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister, however, this is not a tax, because the state charges a tax on the mineral, which is state property.
Only the municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining activity receive the fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money goes to the municipality and one-fourth to the state.
The same ratio will apply to the extraction of radioactive rock.
The part of the money collected by the State from the extraction fees will be assigned to a specific purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mining rescue service.
The bill was criticized by opposition lawmakers, who said it would damage mining communities and regions.
For example, Michal Kucherera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the finance minister can improve the budget", said David Kádner (Usvit), elected in the Usteck region.
The increase in unemployment in Mostecka was warned by KSČM MP Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucher wanted to return the law to the government for finishing.
The explanatory memorandum states that according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in the coal prices, since more than 90% of the prices are negotiated in the long term.
The main consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not be affected by the price increase.
'On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,' the Government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in fees is tolerable from the point of view of employment.
The rapporteur on the Milan Urban amendment (CSSD) said it was crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits on coal mining before the law is passed.
If the limits are exceeded, it will have an impact on the state and local revenues, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak army mine should be made after 2020.
The limits on the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability reasons.
Time for the US Federal Reserve to decide on interest rates
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is set to convene in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters survey of 80 economists found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make the decision now think they will remain idle for some time, keeping interest rates in the range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
We are approaching the point where a central bank could be able to get out of the zero-sum game and start the process of normalizing interest rates", says Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has done fairly well, there's been a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the national account and creating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They've warned the markets to be ready for a raise, but circumstances suggest they also see a strong chance against this move.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a note.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a note saying he was sorry for the first killings and wished he could take it back, government officials revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called police Monday morning around 10:00 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night", and he also mentioned that there's a cute dog in the house who won't bother anyone, but he's upset.
Police requested the caller's name, but Lamb didn't identify himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why the shooting was in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, which read, "I'm so sorry and wish I could take it back".
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me.
After leaving a note, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta State University, where he killed his history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, and then took his own life.
Dean William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was clearly going on in Mr. Lamb's head".
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was no evidence of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce was 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was shaken throughout the case.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to relatives on Monday and said he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled over and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to his resume posted on the school's website, Lamb earned his doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All these things certainly collect their tax.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has been left in tears by this injury and has been out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moreno's reckless action in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture of the leg and is now in the hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a kid who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very hard, but he's playing fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he's going to play this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee didn't punish the Mexican, Nicola Rizzoli.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly operation with both legs.
Shaw's account tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back stronger".
Manchester United have reported injury to Luke Shaw in the PSV defeat
The England defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It was a very ugly injury".
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everyone is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the other player.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like he touched it, but I didn't see the interception on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm really sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better than you do.
Every parent knows this thing: When a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for him to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron, of course.
When asked by a children's book provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, a 1971 Dr. Seuss fairy tale.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website, and he continues: "Witty, moving, creative and powerful, I enjoyed reading to my children because it always had an image or message behind it that I hadn't seen before".
Well, except that in the next paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the book's plot from an excerpt from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", is the brief content of the book that records the love object of the unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text added by Cameron reads like a summary of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have been familiar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being ravaged by the greedy, tree-roaming industrialist Once-ler, who, despite protests from the titular Lorax, is a shrunken, moustached creature who "speaks for the trees".
Most likely, this relatively insignificant PR assignment was given to an assistant who had never read the Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for Downing Street said the text was likely from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was provided by an employee of Cameron's, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but still holds
To play Pakistan in the UAE is a tough challenge, but after looking at the team England have chosen for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat they suffered last year in the Test series is unlikely.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is the starting spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the Test series level, represents the attacking option.
Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England team for the Test series and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is a tough one to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests stood against two good attacks in tough conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are judged on performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because -- and I've said this before -- players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he manages to score more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not exactly 100 percent, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batter gets to show up is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps just like Sam Robson before him while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you can complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a first chance in the Caribbean even though Lyth was in the best shape but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and that's a pitcher I'm giving a very positive rating to.
He's an X-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did it.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will all depend on the overall composition in the UAE, of course.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, has been put forward, and I have no objection.
I don't understand why the stroke maker can't start and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a terrific cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tryouts before his performance in 2001.
He's had three centuries in a flash and hasn't looked back.
Zafar Ansari is joining the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the chance to watch him, he struck me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics -- average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and I see that as a draw, but there aren't a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors have decided on youth.
They're gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems England have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterful move.
He's one of the most beautiful players, who brings rich experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming on the white-ball tour and bringing to the team both energy and a relentless spark.
I always felt he was born right into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even voices that are consistent with what has been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham teammate Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors don't make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work is about the results.
Such decisions should never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived strategy of renegotiation to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party, or the TUC will take on the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is sinking into various crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states are fed up with the British self-centered agendas, concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want to do it even if they were looking at Social Security.
We could even call it the Dave and George selfie agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home with the words that they're winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a disinterested Britain in European Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point where they don't care about our leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany's carefully balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad for her, as it did for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also fading.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs in helping the British selfies, who could have better invested their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to do themselves, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be deliberately planning SNP-style unhelpful remarks during the campaign for the 2017 referendum in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, a friend claims.
"Renewals solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value to negotiate".
Europeans know to their own detriment how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the media oligarch barons are of the EU because they were not there during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 which supported our 1973 accession by a 2:1.
They may dimly remember the name Boris Johnson, the dashing Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels correspondent for "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of rogue tax evaders, foreigners hacking into phones, and the pseudo-overseas departments that owned most of the big papers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a mad gorilla, you have to throw bananas at it so it doesn't take you to dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair admitted the principle of abolishing the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him an expulsion card.
The press never forgave him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-adopting the strategy of boycotting Murdoch and Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and is now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC chair he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is, I'll put it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the rabid tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englandism can certainly afford it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't be bothered to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his grandfather fought his loyalty on TV without going too far and lost his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" -- Bennet's phrase -- apparently wasn't what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC was telling colleagues and members of Congress in their private meeting Monday night,
Whatever the background, whatever the sensitive image Corbyn is trying to convey - don't forget, it touched me too - the discipline of reporting remains important in the age of daytime television and especially in the faith, the cradle of paranoia and betrayal that social media is.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic twist on EU membership - in keeping with their Bennite-backed economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic wrangling.
As with his twist on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced the JC campaign won't want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of it all for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on British concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the rapid "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as it cuts the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the launch Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize electronic reviews published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a "milestone" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the scope of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base" on which PHE was basing its main findings.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claim that it was "built on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They state that the public might expect that the PHE claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to produce a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had allegedly previously obtained funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also endorsed the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, it states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted to funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they supply.
The reason for the selection of the panel members is not available, but they include several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The tobacco management also attended the meeting at PHE.
The report produced by this group "exclusively admits" the lack of "solid evidence of harmful effects of most products on most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a smoking pathway for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the claim had been answered in the BMJ before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers will die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they do only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 executive Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop airing shows like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give their right hand" to hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes not produced by other British television broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for deploying public service programmes that would likely be watched by only a handful of people, into difficult broadcasting times compared to his rivals' top rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to link up with the BBC for the six years he had worked at Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions", Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee as part of talks on the BBC's future.
If you keep licensing fees, which I'm not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should reduce the creation of at least programs that others don't make or commission.
They're doing The Voice in prime time because they want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would be broadcasting it is a ridiculous joke, and of course, it makes no sense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, and of course, it's made in-house.
Honestly, other channels would be willing to lend a hand.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasting services.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty about catching up "because of the ambition of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support".
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC would market the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more pampered public service programmes "go to BBC4 where quite often the audience cannot be measured but they are exercising their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn of licence fee revenue, "But of course we do all these obscure programmes that nobody watches".
They're broadcast when no one's watching.
As for the licence fee, Johnson told the Commission: 'I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a lot, but for people who think £150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they pay that much, because they don't watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now already classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio - and should take the public broadcasting model in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and entertain".
On the subject of partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were only a handful of those on television, and link up with commercial reporters so we could all see them online.
 Sonogenetics or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction in which the spider is moving.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny gills change direction when they are struck by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching on the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
The researchers said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activates them outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the patient's brain to stimulate the brain, which is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The glands don't normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that a reaction occurs when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that then pass through the worms' bodies.
The amplified ultrasound waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Sound waves open these channels and activate the cells to which they are attached, reports the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the larvae with ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they activated the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light.
However, Chalasani has been told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to a desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical therapy to treat neurological diseases", Chalasani said.
He added that the method could also be applied to muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
An illegal torture facility right on your doorstep!
Advertisements disgracing the British arms trade.
Watch this video on the arms market by Amnesty International.
The terrible killer drones!
Leg shackles that break ankles!
The shrapnel!
And electric stun guns that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the caricature metaphor leave no doubt that this advert at the world's biggest arms show is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities of the International Cheerleading Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being run with posters at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the font of the London Underground sign with DLR lines becomes the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute them throughout London and with the help of "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per Allen key, which reportedly "gains access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this fly-posting vandalism.
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go on to work with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the anti-gun posters is for the health of subway passengers.
The video, which has been viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours, was created by the VCCP agency, working without claiming any fees, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads -- he'd see a blank spot in the ExCeL calendar -- and think, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They were playing around with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but "by adding color and animation, we managed to get more people involved".
"They did a fantastic job and helped raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture devices are not trafficked illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US military for "an AT4CS RS shoulder-launched launcher".
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers stunning effects from behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it is, it's not gonna be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for college life
I moved to the college 11 years ago as a careless 19-year-old boy, still believing in the barrel and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I bothered - and the many, lengthy complaints of others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the railroad can range from mildly nerve-racking to utterly shocking.
It's tempting to babble: tell people where you're from, if you took a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why you don't really love or hate Marmite, because, you guys, it's just a leavening extract.
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you like and the people you wouldn't hang out with even if your eyelashes were in the same fire and they were issuing fire extinguishers.
Give the people some room.
People's rooms are often converted into drinking receptions, movie venues, and communal public spaces, but they are also rooms where people dress and arrange their underwear.

No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go so I can get back the energy I used to talk to you".
Try to see when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a kid in my class who used to say if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started going to college at the peak of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and having a baked-cake show seems a little less weird, less like, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've made you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions".
Offering home-cooked treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and they may end up with your face as a pleasant surprise.
That's the thing about being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and yeast will probably ensure that others will pretend to be asleep if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college campuses.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double-check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're mad inside.
If someone steals from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who traded her milk for dishwashing to punish the thief.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noises that distract people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit, because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had a note.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours, then she played her own music loud, locked the door, and left for her three-hour notebook.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same college as you?
And conversely, wouldn't it be shockingly embarrassing if you mistaken your roommate for your future husband, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe even took control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you don't give in to your heart - but if your sexy roommate isn't your future husband, at least try to talk a little bit about your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about safety by keeping something from them - never pollute someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys to the water bottle in the freezer - but never stick their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve looked forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects.
Eva had a rough time with seven-year-old Vickie.
Her father broke up with her, and she was left to prepare and raise a child.
I adjusted to the situation fairly quickly - I was looking forward to the baby and looking for the positive.
The insecurity and being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly hoped that we wouldn't be alone for long, remembers Eva today about her first pregnancy.
She met an older Vashk on the Internet, and they started talking about their favorite movies.
Your uncle even brought Eve and Vítek home from the maternity ward, but he didn't get too caught up in the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while", described Eva in the documentary series Four in a Three.
The theme of the third season of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness on the second try.
She managed to take care of Vítka and the financial security of the family thanks to a part-time job and the great help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for an alien child did not eventually corrupt Vash's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítky's second birthday, and he now understands Vák as his dad and he also addresses him as his dad.
Although he has two grown daughters, Vashek says that at 60 he enjoys fatherhood and is more involved with his children.
In addition to Vítka, they were joined by two-year-old Leontínka and finally by twins.
"Vashek came into our family naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked to me about relationships", says a smiling Eva.
Is there a little room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ella were born by C-section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis late in her pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which then become excess in the blood of the pregnant woman and are mainly manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, threatening premature birth and death, and usually resolves itself in the mother after birth.
Emma and Ella were born healthy, even though they were only 36 weeks pregnant.
Emily was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vasko's niece works, who managed to take her in and put her up.
Elinka was bigger, and I had her with me right after I moved her from the I.P.R. to the room, describing the difficult period after Eva was born.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until doctors allowed the babies to be released, and in the meantime they had grown to about five pounds.
Waiting for the baby to be born in Eve's maternity ward was no fun.
"I was madly in love with my husband and children", recalls the difficult times in the ward, a mother of four who was six weeks pregnant.
She and her husband were considering signing a reverse, partly because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, this did not happen, and doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are on CTV1 Tuesday nights at 9:45 p.m.
A large family can be humble.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva has had to put up with an electric double-decker car and cramped conditions.
The house did not get bigger, but Vasek delighted Eve by installing a gas stove to make it more convenient for six people to prepare meals.
If it's raining, we'll take turns taking a taxi.
Eva believes that children are more interested in the family's comfort and pleasant atmosphere than in the size or clutter of the house.
We've been doing pretty well so far, better than we expected.
"Clutter is worse in a small space, and we sometimes cross a baby rolling over, but at least we're all close", smiles Eva, who can find the positive in every situation.
Your work as a film lighting man is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes drives the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At 60, he says he can physically handle the finances of the family and the children, but how long will he be able to do so?
"I realize that given our age difference, one day it will be me who will feed this family", admits Eva bluntly in an interview about the future.
She would like to return to work, but even more attracted to the possibility of starting her own business.
I'm not exactly a good fit for an employer with four kids.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a cab, the cute blonde jokes.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
It's all the screens.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a more robust chassis, or a touch-sensitive display - these are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
The trend at Apple so far has been that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generation iPhones, which had slightly increased in weight compared to previous iPhones.
The difference of two grams in weight, to the detriment of the novelties, was really negligible.
But that's not the case with the new iPhones.
Compared with last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the smaller model has gained 14 grams, and the larger one has gained 20 grams.
On the one hand, it's no wonder that last year's Apple pocket flip affair was a huge hit.
The chassis of the new model is made of a more durable 7000 aluminium alloy, which also reflects the weight.
But the screen has a much bigger impact on her.
Apple's newest technology is 3D Touch, which allows displays to detect the force of touch.
To do this, the display had to be fitted with an additional layer of capacity sensors.
The new iPhones have more than doubled the screen weight of previous generations.
The smaller iPhone went from 12 grams to 29 grams, and the larger iPhone went from 19 grams to 40 grams.
So the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of just 143 grams is achieved by the de-fattening of most of the other components.
The heaviest component used in the larger model is the battery, but its weight has not changed from the previous model.
Again, the biggest increase is in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As far as new display technology is practical, it will only show up when you use it.
The first users will be able to try it out as early as Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will go on sale in selected countries.
Have cereal been the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of modern human habitation from different eras, including murals, remnants of tools, and so on and so forth.
But in layer 23A, which the instruments date back to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that looks very much like the remains of a breakfast buffet.
The traces of oat grain were found at the site, which apparently went through the process of making the flour that is so popular today.
In this way, the grain is first soaked, then dried, stripped of the covering, called the pollen, then heated and the surface polished.
Grain was discovered in the Paglicci cave, which was apparently heated or steamed, and then probably crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by the use of traces on two stones in the cave.
So the researchers, in their publication for the journal PNAS, were unable to prove that the cave had a complete process for making flakes, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the cereal, but the idea that it was with some liquid and quite possibly heat, of course, makes perfect sense.
It is also a very interesting evidence of how intensively people used grain long before agriculture was invented.
If the flour interpretation is correct, the oldest flour predates agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports from the Brno City Transportation Authority.
So I listened to the names of the stops in the trolley bus once again: Hnusáčekova, Přízrak, Frazov, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolley was a little louder, so the men's voice announcement was a little less understandable than before, when the stops were announced in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise it is better distinguished than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that the announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I've lived in Brno for decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops by heart, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can say that the final stop they accidentally arrived at was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of announcer - but better yet, the announcer - should be made again, this time with the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the buzzing of the bus speaker is almost lost.
So that we don't have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Hershpice, Smyrna, or the waterfall in the creaky shack I moved to in Komarov.
I suppose my old-age hearing didn't suddenly deteriorate so much during that one day when the announcer changed.
I understood the reports quite well before that day.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the tracker's logs.
Few people today know what the biggest and smartest party governments were called comprehensive checks.
I took the liberty of recalling it.
The bus was late.
I broke into the dispatcher's office just as the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't run into the Comrade Chief, he came a minute ahead of you and he doesn't seem to be in the mood", the dispatcher remarked as I entered my arrivals book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write me that I'm going to the precincts for a small-scale mechanics overhaul.
I can't, it's the auditions today.
Everyone's fucked up, like, to the point of horror.
What's the matter?
"You'll see", the dispatcher grinned.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door to the chief's office opened and the chief appeared.
Drunk, with a face of stone, in perfectly flat shape.
"Good morning, Chief", I said respectfully, and quickly fastened two buttons on my uniform jacket.
"Good morning", came the reply, and I hurried to the second floor, unaware of the cold, sinister tone of the old man's reply.
"You're kidding", greeted me Eva, an engineer, an elderly lady whom I greatly respected.
She was even chief of police before the comrades deposed her.
There's a check-in, and you're gonna get there in one piece.
I've asked you many times what the complex checks are, but nobody wants to talk about it.
They say they only live here once every three years, and they have to have everyone there, and it's kind of uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see about that.
I pulled a file of periodic reports out of my drawer, and there was a phone.
"Here's Holcman, come to me right now", the chief's voice said.
What's bothering you?
We just met and nothing"... I muttered, but no one answered, each with his own thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I'm here at your command", I said, barely entering the chief's quarters.
The chief was sitting at his desk, looking at some leaflet.
"Comrade Mechanic", he said after a moment, without lifting his head and still carefully examining the left-hand side, "I do not like your behavior at all".
He threw the left over the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual uncomfortable, angry, prickly gaze.
I found out.
What's the matter, man?
Yesterday, the deputy praised me for my work in the last few months and said he was very pleased with me.
That the chief did a very good thing in pulling me out of the platoon at a distance.
Now this?
You realize you're a track distance technician and you have to act like one.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I said that I had been using that greeting since I was a child, that I had been raised that way, and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
It was like a turkey's red coat to the chief.
"You're on a socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work", the over-excited chief said.
Plus, you're always confusing the addresses for your superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the next time you say "comrade".
But I'm not a master chief to you, I'm a comrade chief.
The deputies are comrades deputies, the chief trainers are comrades chief trainers!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with the usual civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your privilege not to be in the party", said the chief, who had calmed down a bit.
We'll talk about that later.
Anyway, remember, the chair upstairs is not your retirement account.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good on the person.
For a moment he poked me with his cold, stinging gaze, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his high-pitched grunts.
He was only a few years older and he was playing God, or comrade God.
Squeamish, arrogant, authoritarian, arrogant, as he saw fit at the time.
He was all cheered up.
He's the chief.
Actually, not everyone, the party organization chairman, like all party members, but also non-party members, was teasing him.
But the chief was a bully to many, especially those over whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just wiped me out for a complete bullshit.
I had a thought about ass, and it took me a lot of work not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to the grocery store, let alone be a railroad clerk.
How would I feed two kids?
And the house is laid out!
I was upset, but I held it together.
I'm not gonna give him the pleasure.
"That's all for now, you may go", the chief concluded, and began again to carefully examine the leaflet he had previously held.
I was called in at 2:30.
Everyone in the office had been there, and when asked what and how, they said, "Yes, it'll be fine".
Only Yogin said, as he used to, that they could not throw us all out, because the work would have to be done by the Comrade Chief himself with his loyal ones, and that he would not threaten.
He stressed the word "comrade" as if he knew what the old man had done to me this morning.
There was a nice meeting at the chief's office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long consulting table other comrades who were to decide whether or not I was an official.
HR, ROH chair, staff writer, special-purpose reporter, something like a military contrast, and deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the strip.
A common railway worker, he'd chop grass or throw a fork.
But also a former bodyguard.
Rumor was, he was a funny, funny beast back then.
The bad language said he left school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the criminal was canceled, he ended up on the shelf at the grocery store.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul inside me, a little neck that couldn't be swallowed.
The clerk read the opinion from the citizens' committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, I have two children, and so on and so forth.
So far, it's good, I thought, and I'm breathing a little bit better.
Then the opinion from the street party organization.
He copied the opinion from the Citizens Committee, maybe they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents, longtime party members, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently quit the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief gave me a sharp look.
The sketch artist noticed and stopped reading.
The chief has ordered us to proceed.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was recruited as the party's candidate.
Despite my parents' withdrawal, the party has given me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the National Committee, I had a church wedding.
I failed the party in the worst way.
That's why I was cut from her list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even conducted a church funeral for my mother when she died, even though she was a former party member.
I'm saying this to show my negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the clerk finished, only the chief's tapping of the pencil on the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
I kept telling myself, "Communists are superhuman, Communists are superhuman".
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the swing without any fucking checking.
But now?
She took up the career of a railway clerk before it even began.
Back in the company?
I don't think I can do that. The chief's gonna fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade in question?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question on the frame.
Well, according to the previous employment report.
You got him here?
The caddy obviously hasn't had a few.
He's got a drip of sweat on his cheeks, winking nervously, like he's being examined.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well", said the chief with a hint of jubilation, which often foreshadowed storms.
On the surface, he was a great guy, a graduate of the Industrial School, a locksmith's apprentice, a 120-percent average.
But the essence is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he turned again to the clerk, who felt that it was somehow starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a clerk.
This is the one my comrade gave me when we boarded.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to join the platoon", the clerk lamented.
And there's no need for a report, so his was kind of an extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were put in the technical function, this paper cage was enough", the chief said quietly.
The caddy blinked nervously and had no answer.
"No problem, we'll discuss it later", the chief concluded, and the clerk was obviously relieved.
It's settled for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
He's gonna barf all of a sudden, and that's it!
My eyes were dark, I was hot.
There was a flurry of remorse and blame, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who deserved no mercy.
That by pointing out the incomplete report, I misled the Comrade HR-Referent, not understanding why the report was incomplete when I got it from the factory HR-Referent.
I am also an anti-socialist, who, in the process of building real socialism, supports, and even participates in, the religious darkness.
That, that, there was a lot of stuff that I did, or maybe I'll do, and I was quietly praying that it would stop.
I didn't care about anything anymore.
I didn't care if I got out of the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took my sandwich.
That's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the Comrade Chief.
"That's enough, comrade chief", the party chairman suddenly responded, sharply interrupting the chieftains of the Levites.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did a stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Remember that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to be shut out of his party in time?
To open them up again, he'll have to prove he's changed, that he's worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did he get that?
Is he that reader or has he been parroting phrases from party training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who is to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, but somewhat mistaken comrade in his efforts to recover!
It's your party duty, which no one can take away!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us.
Here comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but she loves.
When the chairman finished, no one dropped a word.
This is a turn of events that nobody expected.
I'm the least of them.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman", the chief added coldly, trying to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's exactly the conclusion I was coming to.
They all nodded in agreement, but it was clear from their faces that they did not believe a word he said.
"So I've been confirmed as the Independent Reporter of Basic Care", I whispered as I returned to the office, and immediately I started to cry.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch except for engineer Eva.
The silences listened to my incoherent narration of recent experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked me for coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the kettle and made the cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about the set design practices.
How one review, often full of praise, is given to a person, and another, which is somewhat dirty, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't finish where I was supposed to, but on the cutting board at the store, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our sketchbook?
He just cares where he eats and drinks, and that's how it ends.
"He's got it from the old man", she remarked maliciously.
He's not gonna like it today.
Be careful with him, though, he's a bit of a vengeful one.
And the party chairman?
Basically a much worse chief, no manpower.
Zero from a power-hungry shrink.
The water in the coffee started to boil, and soon the office was filled with the smell of freshly poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into the cup and quietly mixed the hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
I'm not getting fired now, and the next auditions are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I will not forget this day.
Published in the anthology LITERÁTAS NA LATII. by EPIKA
The symbol of the village came alive.
The windmill wheel over Chlum is spinning again after years.
It is visible from afar because it is placed on a fifteen-meter-high mast.
People in the wider community call it "the windmill on Chlum".
For the 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality acquired on the occasion of the 2010 meeting of the natives.
"We asked for a sign and of course we wanted a fan on the sign, everyone in the area knows it", said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local engineering landmark.
It's a bit of a present moment, because it reminds us of the time when people here were struggling for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution that would then be suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near Chichov, a well seven meters deep was dug.
Three years later, a new metal structure was added to the well, with a wind pump that pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic in Moravia at a cost of CZK 2,400", says a memorial inscription on the ground floor of the tower structure.
After several repairs and windmill failures, the pump was retired in 1971.
Then, on May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began: On that day, a new water supply system was put into service in Chlum.
The wind pump was now only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The Dominant was launched at this year's Native American rally.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlum decided to repair the windmill and restart it.
They had a replica of the original wheel made, one foot in diameter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but had to be lowered that same year.
The maker of the replica did not choose the right material, and the wheel could not withstand the wind.
Then the Chlum dominata rested for several years, dismantled under the roof.
But as of June this year, the wheel is turning on a high pole again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the municipality had the replica of the wheel modified and re-installed it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only pumps the water from the well into the blind shoulder of the assailant.
And we shut it down for the summer because the well was running low.
At least it was spinning empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind turbine from the pump in the suction basket again", explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the windmill has been included in the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole of the Vysočina Region.
A similar element in the sign is used in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovic and Zelená Hora in Vyškovska, in Kuželov in Hodonín, in Partutovice in Přerovska or in Polica in Vsetínska.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to Tripoli's support Goian.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career", 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by George Hague, and it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I can score a goal for Sparta now.
Only this time we won't lose", Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is a key pillar of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the onslaught of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybsh of the Greek duel.
And he has some idea what might be coming to him on Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in Astra in Romania with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their games back then.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, too, Goian said.
He didn't name any other players from Prague, so the direct question was whether he knew David Lafat, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly reproachful look, pointed at the Czech journalists.
A helpless look on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment, he let it go.
We were watching some videos and I noticed that Sparta is playing a lot as a team.
He's got some really good players.
What about Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else besides Fataie.
The Spartans know that about Goian very well.
"He has experience from the big clubs, he's kind of holding the Asteras defense, he's kind of their game organizer", Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal observed.
Goian may have had his best years, but he has a very interesting footballing resume.
He was once the subject of interest at Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but he moved from Steauy to Palermo, Italy, and also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're looking at an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European Cups, they're fighting to win the Czech league.
For me, he's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
"Like Sparta, we will try to win", said Goian.
I'm in the room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about the Czech opponent.
I'm going to be fine.
But I can tell you on behalf of the whole team that we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola's moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering a listing on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola's new headquarters should be in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for the purpose of trading the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group headquartered in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the situation in society, says Daniel Buryš, Chief Financial Officer of the Kofola Group.
'In connection with the relocation of the Group's headquarters, the shareholders are considering the placement of their shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.'
In order to enter the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalising a securities prospectus which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company's seat and the related share transfers will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction with only existing shareholders participating.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The company stated that the shareholders of the company would be able to buy shares in the company's shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
The company has already indicated in the past that a possible share offering could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech TV in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the mainstream Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news program of Czech TV.
And how did she hold up?
When the faculty of journalism teaches about how the media can manipulate reality, they can broadcast today's broadcast of the Czech TV event.
The immigration crisis was the focus of about 80% of the news coverage.
The first minute when the Czech Republic reported on the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on the police, euphemistically calling them out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current migrant propaganda was already going on - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for NGOs to criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as an opportunity.
The movement of refugees - The CCP consistently uses the terms 'refugee' and 'refugee' rather than 'migrant'.
What is particularly striking is that the CTU consistently uses only images of young children and women in its illustrative images.
In the same broadcast, she herself stated that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda unparalleled by communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in the making.
When I once climbed onto a pancake apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
My fish are moving into the toilet.
The housefish, the insect with the imperfect transformation, that is, the unprocessed transformation from caterpillar to beetle, and the young look like an adult, only they are tiny and grow gradually.
I hated them, and I didn't want to destroy them.
First by hand, then by chemical.
The socialist drugstore was supplying some kind of blue crystal to eliminate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or is it something else?
But it was successful in eliminating them.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box of some kind of juvenilizer that the ants brought into their nest and it then prevented the queen from generating new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As time went on, insects became objects of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they have the same right to life as we do.
Moreover, I have learned from experience that interference with ecosystems is not successful, and one pest can be replaced by another.
Truth about fleas and bugs, I wouldn't mind making my karma worse by killing them.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don't come around our necks, they can eat the shells of the fallen skin, some of the invisible algae, and so on.
Their peaceful existence was later disrupted by a spider.
He was a common kind of pilgrim who had been living on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived off the occasional mosquito and mosquito, which only added to our comfort.
Since he had been with us for several years, we found that he was a fish-eater and that he had probably kept the fish in a tolerable number.
Through intimate regular contact with each need we found out it was a female.
We've seen romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, carefully tapping on the spider's webs so that it doesn't get eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days, and they didn't move or respond to our controls.
Later, we found the remains of a dried male next to the female under a toilet bowl where the lovemaking was taking place.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon vanished.
Some of them were eaten by their mother, some of them were scattered.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
Right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet resident.
She watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling for a while, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-aggression as friendship.
The population of the somewhat-populated fish had declined, and the spider was calmly observing its normal activities to secure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter had reached an age when using a toilet was a disgrace.
We've tolerated it until now, but the constant spilling of its contents has eaten us up.
We've been telling her more and more to use the bathroom.
But her daughter found an excuse to keep her habit in that spider, which she could see very well when she wiped.
Our talk about seeing a spider, having luck in the house, it didn't matter.
She forced herself into her bathroom by crying and screaming.
There was no rest.
There came a time when the spider had to take orders in order to move his daughter forward.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown over a balcony into a garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt bad after living with him for so long, like I was kicking a relative out.
We assumed that the fish would start appearing more frequently and start to multiply in a geometric order.
You'd be surprised, a week, two, we didn't get any.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider was somehow growing them in the ant pattern, that the toilet environment wasn't as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they were crowding again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their extinction, and I figured that their attachment to the spider must have been because if they can't see it, it's hidden somewhere else and they're in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance triggered some kind of panic reaction in them.
Especially since I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some slight shyness, but they didn't respond to hand waves or quick movements.
My daughter's been going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot her nightgown.
All we have to do is attract another spider.
I'm already broadcasting my wishes and I hope they didn't get mad at me after the execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist of the last century will likely continue to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive so deeply into everything that the results were always stunning discoveries.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He is best known for his special and general theory of relativity, which best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Nor can his explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field be overlooked.
No doubt, the very description and body of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so confusing to many that they prefer easy armistice to a closer acquaintance.
But it's not easy.
But he wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A clock near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of picking out from his plethora of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Smart people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to make them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
But he's the only one who can prove me wrong anytime.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what reflects the empty table?
I don't know what World War III will be fought with, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
There are a thousand ways to kill time, but none to bring it back.
Knowing little is dangerous, and knowing much is too.
If I had an hour to solve a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand about income tax.
Finally, I can't help but mention Einstein's formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula is A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is shut up.
New and modern.
The Zlín region's hospitals are waiting for a $1.5 billion change.
"It is a success, considering that all four have been in the black all year", said chief inspector Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the regional facilities is at this moment about 32 million crowns.
The main contributor is higher premiums from insurance companies, which are just as favorable for this year.
This fact also shows that after years of poverty, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherský Hradiště and Zlín, the project is slated to cost nearly 1.5 billion CZK.
The long period of buying mainly equipment is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top-class healthcare cannot be done, the plans were justified by Lubomír Nečas, the regional deputy for health.
They're looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The construction workers will be coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetina, they are now selecting suppliers for a new interior pavilion worth almost 300 million crowns.
They're planning to build a dialysis unit in Kroměříž.
The Hungarian Town Hall wants to add a new interior to the central pavilion that opens this year at a cost of about 200 million.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central hospital and an inpatient unit, which will require three quarters of a billion dollars, is waiting for the Zlín Hospital.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"It is an extremely important step for the whole region, for patients and doctors", said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, when it comes to the construction of the Vsetín hospital.
The five-story building, which is scheduled to be completed in about two years, will offer comfortable facilities for inpatient and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds, and an intensive care unit.
It's more comfortable for the patients.
The changes, which will be felt particularly by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those where, for example, many sick people are confined to one room, only one toilet is needed on the floor, beds are unflattering, windows are tight, and medical personnel are not adequately equipped.
"For example, our hospital was built 35 years ago and is now at the end of its useful life", pointed out Pavel Kalabek, director of the Zlín hospital.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, plus new facilities.
The same model already has half-finished Hungarian Town Hall.
Central Revenue is already standing, and in three years' time, intern will be joining it.
"We will pay for the construction from a loan and partly from our own funds", explained director Petr Sladek.
This hospital is the only one in the county that can afford to fund itself.
Profits are still at an all-time high, and it hasn't been in a loss since two years ago, when the Zlín Hospital faced a loss of almost two million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increasing revenues and effectively managing costs throughout the hospital", said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients at the Crossroads Hospital are also expected to improve.
Over the next 10 to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new equipment and reconstruction.
The repair of the holding station will be completed this year, then the construction of the dialysis, or the construction of a new building for the magnetic resonance imaging.

No one explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (CSSD) complained that other states were pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but refused any discussion.
He also points out that no one has explained to him how to keep the refugees assigned to the Czech Republic if they don't want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive a response, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text", Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you took at the meeting of the EU's interior and foreign ministers?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have some kind of vision, they're heading somewhere, they have some kind of relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they are redistributed.
We can't imagine that.
We did not receive a reply and therefore wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We were dealing with 40,000 a few days ago, now it's 120,000.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross our borders want to go to Germany.
We're not getting any visitors, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to attract other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who see the Czech Republic as a target country, to get asylum, but the interest of people from this wave of migration, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that we don't really want refugees, but we've already committed to taking in 1500.
Couldn't we get more of them this way?
We've committed to accepting 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: operational hotspots, border security, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that 1,100 people will come to us to handle the asylum procedure.
They come to our detention facility and we treat them the same way we treat those we capture.
It's a big question, and we're going to debate it with Europe, whether we can detain people who are registered in Italy and Greece, possibly Hungary.
Because Europe's attitude is that if they have a registration, they can't be detained.
That means they're coming to our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement, which there isn't yet, it could happen that we don't even keep the 1,100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they'll go back to Germany after arrival.
If we can keep them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we'll arrange the asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent, according to European statistics, are receiving international protection.
Then they get the documents that allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there's 400 people who'll be relocating.
This is the second project that's been going on, and we've only gone so far as to discuss with the churches about the possibility that they could help them get jobs, housing, and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meetings with us, other countries were not willing to discuss.
Is it not the case that the Czech Republic is rejecting quotas but is not offering any solidarity measure to block this discussion?
And what exactly is this solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all Syrian migrants can come to them, then the news will spread in a matter of hours to all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's triggering another wave of migration to Germany, because they just don't want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders -- just to deter the migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
To make it clear they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutors.
If we could separate them and not take them in, or take them in only according to the needs of the economy, then 50 percent of what the social systems are wasting on them today could go to refugees.
Since the first day of German controls, the number of arrests in the Czech Republic has surged.
It's 80 now, the first day it was 12.
How far will it go to make border controls even more stringent?
We were afraid of being caught in the middle of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we arrest will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it the standard way.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the tipping point?
Does it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would take a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, they're draining our capacity to the point where emergency plans are being put in place.
Then I've agreed with the Prime Minister to call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If that situation were to arise, the government could sit de facto immediately and decide with one resolution to strengthen the police, the army, let's call it customs, or the prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency now declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can get to us that far.
We are a nation state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether it's from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that the Hungarians are trying to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost completely.
Slavia paid off a large portion of her debts at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Football Slavia has paid off its debts.
The football players got their money's worth.
Football Slavia appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after a bid of about $200,000 was filed on her by Online Services of Pacific Samoa.
Slavia's lawyer, Zuzana Mladková, tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzla within hours not to declare Slavia bankrupt.
And I must say, she had her reasons.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie was a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, the new owners sent money to the club at the last minute.
This is also proven by the statement of Slavia before the court hearing on Tuesday - the senior club on Monday, just a day before the court hearing, sent debtors tens of millions of crowns.
"All were paid between September 11 and September 15", said lawyer Slavie Mladková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech back-up Mario Ličk.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club paid the city's debt fees.
In fact, only the claims that Slavie contests remain part of the insolvency proceedings.
The club either says the obligations have not been made at all or they are in litigation.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount if we lose these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account", lawyer Mladková told the judge.
"Everything that was past due has been paid", Mladková declared, adding that only non-payable or disputed obligations have been paid.
What is also certain is that in the next few days the judge will not rule and the trial will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed proof that she had actually paid those debts.
Then all the evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected as early as November.
The judge ordered the hearing to resume on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not be taken at that meeting either, but in writing afterwards.

FastMig X is the representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of high technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular structure brings benefits and a rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And it's all kinds of things, from welding structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as from welding rough materials to welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible number of welding curves, the simple setup and the extensibility of the welding source allow for a quick response to changing requirements, which leads to a reduction in downtime, the need to switch sources and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
No more wasted time, wasted materials, or faulty joints.
It provides flexibility, less downtime, more welding and higher profits.
It's a new product this year, which premiered in Nitra, where it also won the gold medal.
We value these honours because they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter control, the FastMig X is among the world's best.
The delivery time of around three weeks is certainly a pleasant one for the interested parties.
We have already established the first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for over 20 years and almost always our sales results are better than before", emphasises Miroslav Streichsbier, who manages Kemppi in Pilsen for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanca could be built to hold.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanca could have been hit even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built without two landslides in Prague's Stromovce, says the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said that Wednesday night at a press tour of the tunnel.
But he said it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It opens to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a trade-off between price and safety.
"The tunnel could be dug more safely, but the costs are increasing exponentially", Butovic said.
He said that the conditions in the tree house were the same all along, yet the ground had fallen just a few steps from where he had started to crash with a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive", Butović said.
The Blanc Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovac, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told Euro weekly.
The original plan was to cost 17 billion crowns.
If you add in the VAT, which doubled during construction, you get 21 out of 17 billion.
If you add technology, land acquisitions and engineering, valuation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is not that far off from the 37 billion, Whitehead said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system for an iPhone with the new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the General tab and selecting Software Update.
When it's ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users have encountered a problem after installation, specifically the error message  Software update failed.
One solution to this problem is to wait until the update is no longer interesting, or try it on iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
This includes the need to uninstall apps to free up space - but it won't be necessary, because Apple has made the update smaller and also made the whole process easier by using a special tool that suggests apps to the user to delete and reinstall after the update is over.
Make sure your phone is charged before you run the update.
If the battery is low, Apple will not allow the update to run, as interrupting the process could cause an update error.

The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its full-year profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55 000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average interest rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January, and higher surcharges for heavy or large parcels by road starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, said that the company had "performed solidly despite weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade".
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 more workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than the $2.44 per share prediction of 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales are up 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the performance of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29%, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger parcels and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
At the pre-trading time, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They finished Tuesday down 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
In their most anticipated session in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran Mahogany table deciding whether it's time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Perched above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Fed has a double mandate from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday about whether the US economy is ready to kick in as it departs from the unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since the end of 2008.
While most data shows solid economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its federal funds rate - by no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It's clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait further", she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with the key indicator only around a 30% chance of rising.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the blow by promising that further increases are imminent.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would keep rates low this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now", he says.
If Fed politicians did, "they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets in hand to avoid panic".
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Fed was on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said she expects to see a rate hike this year through the spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has recorded solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of improvement.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed politicians argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can and needs to cope with higher rates, given the tightness of the labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to falter late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month and the Dow is now only losing almost 10% of its May high.
The volatile market situation gives the Fed a complex calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what's happened in the financial markets, and the reports of weakness in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would be a tightening up at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get better control of the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about how this will affect the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data on the latest developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's top concerns, so technically it shouldn't be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the entire world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "squeeze" their monetary expansion in the market, set off convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, it is to be expected that Fed officials will monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of exaggerated moves in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point during three sessions "despite limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed the cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize financial stability concerns during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest flare-up is nowhere near that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rate increases because markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has yet another dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be on top.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai marketplace that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thai.
The market/warehouse is the single point of contact offering an overwhelming range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even a car part if you need a little bit of engine oil.
The store is massive and it'll take you over an hour to go through all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all the shopping, go grab a bite at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
Items are affordable and many items are sold in bulk.
The mix of fresh products includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and others.
The meat expansion is great, like fish -- the staff at the counter will wash and peel it for you, even fry it for you if you want it.
A good portion of the store is left to the massive freezer section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter half-baked goods, and more.
Who's shopping here: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
The wide alleys are lined with shopping carts and forklifts.
Fresh monthong durian found next to the cash register.
Where it's located: The store is in the industrial district of Los Angeles, surrounded by Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speed on the freeways stays the same.
Acceleration to 90 miles per hour is denied by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
That's what the House decided Tuesday, when it agreed to a Senate amendment that rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Land Communications Act is now headed to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing 100km of speed.
The increase was opposed by Transport Minister Dan Ťok (ANO), who said that the Czech motorway network was not yet built for such a speed.
On Tuesday, before the House, the Senate passed the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow for a speed increase from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four-lane roads, in line with the original government proposal.
The House first extended this option to highways, which would allow speeds of up to 150 km/h to be driven on selected sections, but the Senate rejected it.
The Members have now accepted his proposal.
The Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the authority of the traffic police to have the last word in the adjustment of local communications, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which the House approved, also envisages that sewer, water or public lighting cables can be placed longitudinally under the surface of the roadways.
It would save the municipalities on land purchases.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads irrespective of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road safety and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles whose owners do not report to them.
New municipalities could sell towed vehicles which do not report their owners within six months of the notification of the towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third class roads under penalty of fines even for freight forwarders.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
The government says it saves money to implement the electronic system.
The rebel expresser is going to court.
He's facing 10 years for overcharging citizens.
The case involves the allegedly overpriced Citizens' Welcome project.
The police wanted to prosecute the MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the House of Representatives did not release her.
According to the legal status of the case, they both face up to ten years in prison.
The main screening is scheduled for October 2nd.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The plaintiff relies on an expert opinion.
The applicant claims that the former members of the city council unlawfully made it possible for them to obtain a financial advantage from the company which organised the welcome.
According to the indictment, Mandík instructed the then head of the municipal services, education and culture department to contact five related companies in the tendering process.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the city council cancelled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the contract to the administrator, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
The two charges, which were brought to secure the award of the public contract for Darothore to host the Welcome to the Citizens event in Ústí nad Labem, were made in a long-term and coordinated manner, at least in contravention of the requirement for the procedure to be followed by a proper steward, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, he said, they were aware that, after obtaining this contract, Darothore would subsequently charge the Office of the Lab for the implementation of the Citizens' Welcome, a price which would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company has received more than five million crowns for the project, according to the file.
The city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert opinion, at least one million crowns overpriced.
The maniac has denied any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership was just building on a similar project from years past.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money", added the Mandík.
The criminals originally wanted to charge MP Kaila, who was also a member of the city council.
The House of Representatives didn't put her on trial.
So, the criminal investigation has been put on hold, but they expect to charge Kaila after her term as a member of parliament ends.
The welcoming of the citizens was a social event held several times a year.
Mothers were given a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy baby items and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly let a dog into the fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the recording.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete footage of a police dog allegedly knocking a refugee to the ground.
The Hungarian government, however, disputes this charge.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke to the border with Serbia.
The refugees were approached by police officers, and one of them let a Syrian man attack a dog with a basket on its muzzle.
The dog of a man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee", barked, Muzi claims.
One of the officers noticed Muzi filming everything and wouldn't let him leave.
The reporter was then prohibited from making any phone calls to his superiors or colleagues on the scene.
The police took Muzi to a dark spot near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
The result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary was lost to the man.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a letter of protest to the Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and without fear of the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács challenged Muzi's account of the events, citing a police report.
He said the police just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on certain footage, which they claimed they had the right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to wipe anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and frighten a little, but they certainly don't attack", says Kovács.
The unpredictable champions league.
A win against City will kick us in the ass, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose", shook his head Manuel Pellegrini, coach of home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created much of a chance, but we had the ball in the basket longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals", Pellegrini said, whose team scored in the competitive match after 636 minutes.
Last season's finalist Juventus was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he is the defending champion with only one point and with a score of 2:4 he is only in 16th place in the table.
That's why the turn at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us", believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three pillars before the new season - Pirlo, Tevez and Vidal.
In Manchester, they were represented by Pogba, Manjukich and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe it will lead us to the winning wave", Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the offensive phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"We could have scored 0-2 before our equaliser, but Gianluigi held us up", coach Allegri praised Buffon's goalkeeper.
"We've burned a few good chances", regretted City's second-string player, Yaya Touré.
We need to learn from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye to the old Germany II.
Before we go on to the immigration issue, we should realize that all this media hype around it is driven by professionals.
According to the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of little children, carried on their parents' arms through the dusty roads of exodus.
And this automatically creates in the person - in the European person - a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they're not just desperate little kids coming here, you notice in the pictures of the boats landing on the Greek islands, little kids aren't seen much!
Well, somehow, recently, we've lost sight of the pictures of boats heading for Lampedusa, refugees from the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men lie on its beautiful promenade.
Mostly young black men.
And also the pictures of Callais, where they're eating and the black men are waiting to see if they can get through the Channel Tunnel.
I guess he doesn't care anymore.
Nor did the images of the early Christian church of the Eritreans impress Europeans.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of hiding the fact that it's not just the unfortunate little children from Syria, but also the stylized -- for the elderly: the fashionably glamorous -- young men.
Their muscles look like they just stepped out of some gym.
Just one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish-Muslim part of Cyprus, we were lying on a private beach in a hotel.
Despite being private, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
And young black men came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Aged between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes, with smartphones in their hands.
They were not interested in the fact that it was a private beach, and the employees - Turks, Muslims - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the bunk beds.
If you weren't on it and were in the sea, you were out of luck.
They were dressed like they were in an American rap movie.
A hat with nails on the head, white and colored Adidas on the feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started eating.
They sat around tables, crowded the dining room next door and the white guests of the bar - reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining area to a quiet place.
The black people who came in drank beer right out of the trunks - like in the U.S. series?! - and threw empty bottles around on the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't in English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in their signature swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screamed and screamed in the water, mothers and children and pensioners fled in terror, and within half an hour, not a single black guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Regardless of whether one was a Christian or a Muslim.
Hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah", I said.
"Well, it certainly wasn't work", said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive, eight-inch gold cross around his neck.
And women were like jewelry.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking", the waiter replied.
They don't smuggle drugs, they don't use them.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June of 2105, it wasn't that important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But the Secret Service and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they wouldn't know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe during that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that the totalitarian politically correct politicians, the so-called intellectuals and the lobbying and economically important groups associated with them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now the publicly acknowledged main power in Europe - are lying, lying and lying - but not only they, but also the EU's top brass and the TV, including ours.
For example, recent TV images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on par with the Moscow TV footage of August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but mostly - the old Germans - the Muslims welcomed their fellow countrymen.
For weeks, they were talking on the news on Czech TV, that according to some research, almost all Germans are in favor of the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, anyone who's been to Germany for a few days knows that's a lie.
Which confirms other information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organized by ARD - the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
That's what our TVs were reporting.
But they were hiding what broke out in Germany the next day: that in a poll on the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
True, five years ago, in November 2010, Chancellor Merkel publicly declared: "Our attempt at a 'multi-cult' society has failed utterly".
She added: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society".
"All attempts at such coexistence have failed utterly".
In a country of four million Muslims, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating, which is what they are today, and we have been lying to ourselves for some time that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
That's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we tell ourselves we're just happily living side by side, that's what failed.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel doesn't seem to have the strength to go against the mighty in Germany and Europe and above all against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is escalating rapidly.
The Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the SPD Member, the only one in the European Parliament who is not supposed to have even a high school diploma - yes, this is the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the guard in the concentration camp from the minute - has demonstrated himself as he has done many times before.
It seems, especially in the light of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who for years have been trying, at least outwardly, to come to terms with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is planted in the soul of Germany right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right in stopping the Great Germans' attempts to take over the whole of central Europe with all his might?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was decommissioned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of a Greater Germany, which had led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, is likely to return in a different form.
After the Marxist attempt to take over the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany, based on, for example, ecology, which was, incidentally, one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We'd say sunny.
The German elite had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, and so they left all those anti-nuclear fighters, the enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan, "Our forest must live".
To satisfy the restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, they have fully aligned themselves with the warming movement, they have stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current that considered all Slavs to be difficult vermin - since the days of Karl Marx, who, by Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements by Schulz and German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states, the idea of a leader Germany.
Which must be obeyed without compromise.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when you add in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which is satisfied and which is fed up with the fact that Germany, through the banks and the Union, actually controls most of the countries of Europe.
The sunflower superstition first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism and today has brought them home and may bring millions more Muslims.
Which, lured by the siren sounds, will soon hit a wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they will start a riot.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, it can once again mislead a part of its population - but it seems to be a smaller part - ideologically, but in the end, reality will catch up with it as always.
Is Germany going to burn again?
The Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the arrival of the Islamists break out?
Will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but who have not assimilated to the local customs and laws, come to their aid?
What will the German government do when it is allowed to take in naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans who are watching in fear the Islamization of their country?
What will it do to Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up and loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has been created in Europe by the support of the sunshine ideology, the ideology of the elitist and basically totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unbridled treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it can't go well.
Finished tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the intruders is to scare them to death.
You just knock and the robust flapper will come down on you in a way that the weaker nature may not just give up.
A live head will sweep you away and drive away the weary, accompanying (or rather driving away) the indomitable salesman and the living statue.
Maybe it's a shame that you can't get a talking valve in real life.
We could use a lot of scum and filth to get out of here.
The following is the list of the species of the genus Oxypoda:
A tiny weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it's among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is a type of expansive weed, but it looks good in terms of its blooming.
It's in the outer tile.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well in our garden.
It prefers a dry environment, is adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
It creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth watching and photographing.
The beauty of detail is only under the microscope - yellow flowers and green leaves with a purple background.
Brazilian Pediatric Society of Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet during breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric society SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to educate women about the importance of good nutrition in breastfeeding by using images of babies sucking from their breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets have also been shown to have a negative effect on the immune system of children.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, though Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show.
The move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the Liberal leadership's defection failed to generate a sufficient rating increase for Today.
The morning show Nine aired from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbullo was overthrown by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter as much to Aussie TV viewers, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers on Today.
Today recorded a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling in the gap on Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers so far and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's vote is a clear yes.
Seven's The X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, beating out The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) by a wide margin.
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new television quiz (5 to 5:30 p.m.), presented by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (5:30 to 6:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers  enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half an incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
With the second night's drop in ratings for The Chase Australia, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which couldn't beat McGuire's show.
Originally published as Sunrise, it dominates while Today remains local.
Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The secret uncovered?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who won the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to bachelor with is shrouded in insurmountable secrecy.
And three girls who stay standing, it's not gonna tell who the right one is to get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before, before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood is holding his tongue till Thursday's quarterfinals.
All three women lyrically sang about why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?" their answers could serve as a spoiler as to who gets the Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and the Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one who would best fit Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing a light relationship since day one.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think that during the course", says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthly woman, she's a lot of fun", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They're happy and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a great couple.
She claims that during his last visits to the house, she realized that Wood might be "the one".
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my heart to him now", she adds.
I asked her who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that", she pointed out.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snezen and Lana.
Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to launch his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest in his move to the United States, and a lot of teams have been asking about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit out the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by an Australian rugby league convert on the first kick from the pass in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had faith in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his mistake and focus on the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught cursing when he mistakenly left the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start to his NFL career he could have imagined.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapeze to his original debut in 2007, when a home-court recording led to a Queensland triple.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo of the fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet for a discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun pointed at him on a Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The US defended the emigrants who demanded restitution.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple applied to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the amount they had sought, namely over CZK 2,8 million, but the Court of Appeal reversed their claim by awarding them only less than CZK 90,000, with reference to the fact that the amount of compensation was determined in accordance with the 1991 price regulations.
The immigrants were upheld by the Supreme Court and fined the amount originally sued.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, complained to the US.
In the meantime, the social and economic conditions have changed to such an extent that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although it was adequate in relation to the property taken away - now amounts to only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be the burden of the interveners as the restitution of the beneficiaries who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who were not able to obtain compensation earlier", explained the judge-rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the ICC sided with the emigrants.
"The Supreme Court has repeatedly advocated that the ordinary courts should proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the disadvantage of the persons entitled and that the purpose of the restitution legislation, namely the redress of the property damage caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved", the judge added.
Evita will now be played by Radka Fischer in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fiszara became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Timea Ricea at the Prague Spiral Theatre.
He says of returning to the same role, "To date, the challenge of Evita's performance has not been matched".
Because evita is not only a great role, it's a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of First Lady of Argentina by Monica Absolon.
I saw Moncha in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I'm pretty much a fan of modern editing, but this one's just particularly well-done.
"The direction of Ondrej Sokol is original, light-hearted and contemporary", says Fischer.
The imaginary handover of the musical sceptre between the two singers will take place at the birthday concert of Monica Absolon on September 27 from 7 pm in the Studio DVA theater.
The evening will culminate with a musical by Evita.
The experiences will certainly include the joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondrej Sokol will also step away from the director's desk, when he represents Karl Roden during the filming of the film as President Perón.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the theatre Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
The main female role was originally played by Monika Absolonova in the film directed by Ondrej Sokol.
She is joined by Karel Roden as President Perón and Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from the studio of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Marko, who participated in the first performance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters protesting a proposed new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known for their ability to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across Nepal's southern plateau, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have created a new province under a proposed new constitution, and has diminished their political clout.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, who are demanding the creation of their own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes.
When the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces  a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted on the provisions of the draft constitution this week, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely shouldn't panic now.
After losing on the ice to the champion Litvínov, you couldn't even win a home match with the Spartans (3: 5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous extra-league entry as last year?
I hope nothing like this happens again.
The space folk.
NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of the Cape Islands.
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added the Miami-based weather forecaster.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google announced this on their blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the story on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"We have traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear", Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But as the migrant crisis in Europe worsens, more and more families like this one are willing to help.
All proceeds will be shared among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said that it will double all contributions made through google.com/refugeerelief to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most coming from Syria, which has been ravaged by four years of war and has displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For moderately obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The weight loss benefits of surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight-loss surgery than those receiving nonsurgical treatment.
"The mortality data take a long time to come out", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight-loss surgery who wrote the editorial for a new JAMA surgery study.
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, they use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body's absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal at values between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in treating type 3 diabetes procedures in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who did not receive surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among the surgical patients, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially resolved in 28 percent.
In the treatment group, only about 1% of patients had complete and only about 2% had partial resolution of diabetes.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown to be "generally better in the surgical group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the body's current blood sugar level.
The best way to keep hemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, researchers report.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgery.
After five years, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent), and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvements in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent better chance of surviving the next 15 years than those who had tried more conventional methods.
While the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone said it is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical because it indicates that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start to take weight really seriously after a patient's BMI drops between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation", he says.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that are tightly linked to their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the road back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not capable of accommodating all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interests of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"To take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about the long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through education for these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
While addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the prosecution of George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the violent response of the US has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush, advising him that the way to solve this problem was not to use violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who have taken a sanitary agent in the last four years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol sanitary agents, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of under-12s who reported using sanitary products at poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more access to these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the toilet purposely, while others want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking toilet water for a cheap scare.
Teenagers reportedly mixed toiletries with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the product.
"The kids don't think about the harm that it could do", Lopez said.
Much more attractive are those that are perfumed.
To the left are sanitary products with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very appealing to children.
The toiletries contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few locks can indicate alcohol poisoning.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Toxicology Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey lying around, but people leave these sanitary products outside, and when kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed four lozenges of strawberry-scented sanitary reagent at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold for adult drunkenness, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was speaking vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at the separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchey reports.
"It was very scary", said CNN's Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal to my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or make sure that sanitary products are out of reach of children.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some sanitary products have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary product that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The doctors thought the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and has forbidden their presence in the room.
Police have ruled the foiled plan "innocent chatter", citing school district discipline,
No disagreement in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of Celtic dissent, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it.
The Hearts will be fighting the SFA against the attack on Nelson, and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
The Dons increase their lead over Celtic by five points.
A first-half penalty from Adam Rooney secured a close victory for Aberdeen over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths denies any talk of a disagreement
This situation has sparked rumours of disagreement within Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased oversight in preparation for the match against the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the pressure. I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title rivalry is boring the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers full-back and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, states: "The best of Celtic's games are no longer being shown in the Netherlands, and why?"
Because there are no more Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in right now.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Firm games, and it's not just people from Scotland who watch these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, and Deila is gonna commit.
ROONY Dealia admitted Celtic were stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things around.
A defeat by Malmö and the subsequent relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat by Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now sit at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has had a bad time and will rise again".
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what's happening.
We're in the same place, but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players so much better.
It's very important to stick together now.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements.
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago suggesting he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a major buy-out and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss states: "The winter transfer window is very different from the summer".
The players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season period to stay, which you saw on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes you do more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic's transfer target suggests Michu is retiring
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire at the end of his contract with Swansea.
The 20-year-old shooter has been struggling with a fragile ankle for two years and has been unable to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later revoked - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum to be revoked.
Neilson backs up his claim, stating: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance".
Griffiths has pledged to avoid Tynecastle.
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh, just before the Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a heated moment", the striker said, adding: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in a Celtic shirt".
The Tannadice Council believes in the Dundee United-Donella deal.
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in the repair of the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boy back in action", promises Donnelly.
McInnes is happy for the "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen team had to cling desperately to the Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh consecutive league title and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes notes: "There is no team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning this type of game".
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while overall UK unemployment rises
UNemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10 000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UK rate of 5.5%, as shown by data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, the number of people in work now stopping at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell during the quarter to 74.0 percent - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's almost exactly the year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll be watching the execution of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although shocked, I accepted.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to get scared.
Then why am I doing this?
I've accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, there is a morbid lottery to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of newsroom seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the execution without bias.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossop's closest friends, and I've formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be a witness and a reporter at the same time, so I won't be allowed to notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm just gonna have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my integrity.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner in a way that he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted she "could've put it better", but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could take me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter who's on the ground ready to tell the story.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the anti-death penalty process.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be at my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I'm not gonna go through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of being an accessory to a felony.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
You can turn to other journalists for that purpose.
What you're getting from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die a useless death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he cleared the men of Canning River.
The man's bet on running away from the police failed after he got into the shallow muddy water just feet from the policeman, who tried to persuade him non-violently to return to shore.
Canning Vale Police were called in to an incident that extended to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water, repeating, 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried a safer tactic, police negotiation".
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they're running", Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organisers tried to spy on him and threaten to shut down the races
Peeter Moody has accused the organisers of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He targeted the organisers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, and based his belief that they were campaigning against him with Lady Tata's late scratching in maintenance on race day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation regarding Lidar's positive cobalt swab, which he can't explain.
He's been biting his tongue about the espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes".
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for so long, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all coming out of you all at once", Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head held high, and the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'll have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Earlier, Moody blew the whistle in his interview with racing.com that the department's integrity was trying to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name after question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about things that go on in my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because they've been completely burned trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming personal?
Will RVL grow a few balls and make sure people outside of the coaching position take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
They may need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them some thought.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I'm gonna put pressure on them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The frustration levels of the trainer increased with the long-term investigation into cobalt including Lidari and the recent scratching made him feel like he "could hour his license on the table".
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on race day "ridiculous" after the horse's legs were covered with clay or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for it", he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the racing day coverage, which the organisers had already opened an investigation into.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The Cobram driver who escaped has been arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra on the weekend and drove away after the collision.
A cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorcyclist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is hitting back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' actions as "plan-setting" by two NRL premiership favourites.
Trent Robinson, the Sydney Roosters' coach, said the umpires allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm's controversial victory in the final of the Sydney qualifiers on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly disguised comment on Strorm after his team won the final of the qualifiers over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "parade" of rugby league and saying the two Queensmen were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions, saying they focused on "contact".
Bellamy added that this situation has given him a boost in confidence because his team is being criticized by two head coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing to the Storm.
"It keeps coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2", he said at Bellamy Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system and techniques in the last year, but in the last few weeks we've just been focusing on contact during the interventions, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been here three years and obviously he's coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might come as a bit of a shock.
It's funny how things like this always come up this time of year.
Bellamy disparaged Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about the excitement of football.
He was right that his game on Saturday was as exciting as ours was, and it was just as exciting", Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St George's were criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can play a style of play that he finds overwhelming, especially his young backs with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had that kind of players.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two full-backs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me feel more confident, because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were scored in the Storm vs. Roosters game than in the Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos were probably playing well, I didn't watch, but what's the score?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are pauses and non-scores interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll definitely meet again at some point.
The Storm have a weekend break and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park.
A Serbian man has been bailed out on $200,000 drug charges.
A man facing possible life imprisonment for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland has been bailed out for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with his co-defendants at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial grade cocaine, Maksimovice's lawyer based his defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he possessed the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe by accident and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan thought that Maksimovic would have escaped.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he said in court on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather have jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, because the defendant did not proceed to trial, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he give up both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged onto her online chat room, where he had a bunch of indecent photos of the kids sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up and found her phone missing, and then she found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she could alert her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then analytics computers found the address and discovered a "disturbing" search on the web using terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police that his motive was to "introduce pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a police officer and scaring them".
Public prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted he was the one who did the computer searches, but he claims he was just pretending to be a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He claims he jumped drunk and said he wanted to see the rape and murder footage.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw indecent images on her phone, and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was questioned and told of how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to one count of filing a motion to receive or supply indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violated the terms of his bail on January 25 and failed to appear for his court hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim has requested that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that there was "no substantive sexual context" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed sentencing until October for filing a report on social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody pending a hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offender registry before his sentencing date.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in the parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of him falling went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against spitting at Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his State of the Union address in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary club, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't show up, but it's called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
He warns the Members concerned that their immunity ends in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had "concerns" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is going to cut jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save on the costs of business services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate its PC and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion, according to the company's statement, and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This would lead to the breakup of a company founded in 1930 by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a manufacturer of electrical equipment whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP was going through a massive reorganization to handle the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in America, is the latest in a sector based on the belief that a tightly-specialized firm does better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere at Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it's still September and if his rehab goes as planned, there's no reason he can't play again on Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his participation in the next summer European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The big shame of this latest issue is that Wilshere finished last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back to form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat", Wenger claims.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he suffered earlier.
That could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
This is also where an unpleasant pattern is created.
A survey by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he has played in only 65 league games for Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a wider perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to have missed the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the magic circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in the area of injuries recorded over the past season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition", Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he gets the career he deserves.
Arsenal start their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe", says Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also undefeated in a total of 41 games after maintaining their "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday night.
It was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and he remains hopeless to lead the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This commitment is enormous", Wenger says.
That never happened at Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in the various shows is striking, especially given how men need to open up more desperately than ever before when it comes to suicide among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
At the heart of this fight is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends who were "in a good mood", their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, having a healthy circle of friends is half the risk of developing mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be achievable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style rather than content, immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun-loving, more successful, even though we're actually more isolated.
This superficial success is driven by what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of our real values -- our personal desire for growth and friendship -- which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire game developer recently explained, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victimization, the moments of watching football in the comfort of his chair, Ross's longing for Rachel, all stem from the realization that yes, men can relate to it, too, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, "my role as a listener for people who are feeling depressed or suicidal really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference".
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "get over it" is powerful in the sense that you'll be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a longer-term mechanism of reconciliation.
It highlights the little moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the outsider status on the phone helps people in their moments of despair, but long-term support has to come from a closer, more intimate network of friends and family.
So if you're going to be at FrendsFest this weekend on Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Park, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest.
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to take Malmo out
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG beat Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match, and Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League journey with a final comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions to victory, but then they threw away several chances until finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only focused on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their run to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 seasons.
But even though they scored three points, it was not a classic performance of the Laurent Blanc team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a waste of time in front of the goal and was later substituted against his home team and the club where he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League on the field or at home, so a 2-0 win is giving our opponents a hard time and looking comfortable on the defensive is a good start, although there are things we'll have to improve as the season progresses", Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to the PSG team that drew home this weekend 2-2 to Bordeaux in Ligue 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger has been touted as the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and he showed why when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass for Malmo's defence and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind Johan Wiland into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to kick off the spectacular PSG victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to get to this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two drawn defenders were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjicka's shot, which just missed Kevin Trapp's far corner in the 34th minute, there wasn't much to offer in attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with poor passing and a poor finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to score five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the net shortly after the start of the second half Cavani.
However, he proved much more adept when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his overtime that Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan forward who sent his sixth goal of the season behind the line after Ibrahimovic conceded it after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all Malm's thoughts about the possibility of gaining from the match, and only Wiland's excellent close play shattered David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the substitute goal of Ezequel Lavezzi was not recognised at the end of the match.
Malmo's age-coach Hareide admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying is not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a fascinating match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by a commodity price crash, made $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of its shares as part of its massive debt relief plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a commodity price slide as China's economic slowdown reduces demand and sparks havoc across markets.
Rights issues sent Glencore's stock price to a peak on the London stock exchange in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Stocks jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion sale of shares is part of a broader plan to reduce its $30 billion debt, which has accumulated about a third of its total debt.
The company sold new shares at 123 pence a share, a 2.4 percent discount from the closing price on Tuesday.
They have thus disposed of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99% per group.
Fears of prolonging China's slowdown have driven the price of iron ore down by nearly half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed that Washington has visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, which the president visited in November, the report said.
The President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in addressing issues of international, regional and common interest, and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two states", the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue to New York for the September UN session.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and its growing aggressiveness in the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The German emergency beacon fired by the European crew has not yet been fixed, but it is forcing the ship to change course, reports the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - than argue over a future allocation of refugees by quotas based on a quantity that is increasingly out of touch with reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to reallocate 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the member states changed the priority.
Before dealing with the final destination of refugees, it is necessary to filter those who arrive today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to managing migration", underlines the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it's not losing its resolve and increasing the pressure.
It is re-establishing border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of asylum seekers in that country.
The Central Power is making it clear that without it, there is no free movement in Europe.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday has already served as proof.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has already done this.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
It's a domino effect, but he can see blindly.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed into the hinterland.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed this issue intensively during a private conversation with three of their counterparts from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented.
In Italy, unofficial statistics show that two thirds of new arrivals have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to establish any entry point on its territory, because it fears more than others that it will have camps on its shoulders where refugees would gather at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands off the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, squeaky hole in the ground.
Athens, still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has put its hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promised to set up the checkpoints as soon as possible, but did not give a number or a date.
"The challenges facing Greece are Europe-wide", EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
So the question is to deploy the European Border and Coast Guard Agency's (Frontex) response teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed", warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In law, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The question of creating a real European border guard has not been formally raised, but Europe is getting close to it.
The new emergency situation of the 28 Member States has, however, put on hold the question of binding quotas and the 160,000 refugees, which was raised earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still refuse to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was retained in the text approved by a majority of 28 votes on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, as agreed in June at the hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead in an avalanche in the Alps, three of them reportedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
Officials say the German national is also a woman, the only survivor of the eight-member group affected.
Previous media reports said it was Polk.
A woman in her 30's was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe leg injury to her thigh bone.
The dead were mostly in their 40s, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims have been transferred to Briancon for identification", said Pierre Besnard, the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain region, below the summit of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4,015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high", noted rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
He said that a huge amount of snow had accumulated on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service has issued a severe weather warning for the area today.
Trpišovsky before the match with Braga: finally the real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his first cup match, managed to get through the Europa League pre-season into the group stage with the Liberca players and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan welcomes 2011 finalist Braga at the start of the main stage of the competition and according to the coach, he wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination rounds, where every goal and every situation could have knocked you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we're not tied to a simple double.
"I'm really looking forward to it and it's the real Europe, before it was just qualifying", Trpišovskiy told a press conference.
Braga is a top team.
He's going to be very active, they've got all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good with the ball.
The opponent may be harder to beat, even if he doesn't have a name, but he has a player in his squad who I think has scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's a great unit at the top teams level", Trpišovsky said.
But he doesn't consider Braga the clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we showed that we are strong in our stadium in both the home and the preliminary rounds, and we want to confirm that", said the coach, whose team lost only the inaugural Super Cup in Pilsen out of 11 matches this season.
He believes that the Liberator can impose his style on Braze.
We're looking at a team that's going to be strong on the ball, but also unusually disciplined.
They're playing from a 4-4-2 position with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field", said Trpišovský.
We studied our opponents a lot in the pre-series, which helped us a lot, but this time we want to focus on our game, so we adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very challenging, to play to our notes", the coach added.
Student films take over Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works for the 15th annual competition of the International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Four dozen of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and teachers, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Cinema of Portyč.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year the festival has a special theme, which is derived from the festival's theme.
She's a detective this year.
Director Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our quest this year", Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student productions - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
The awards will be judged by an international jury, including last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The festival organizers are preparing an accompanying program as they do every year.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondrej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondrej Smeykal, the turbo-bass band Let's Fly?, the live band Zrny or for example Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photography exhibitions.
The first to arrive is the graduate of the Sand Film School and the recipient of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Achenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring you closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will be present to talk to the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by music by Gerhard Gruber and the sandy natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to come together here, to exchange experiences and develop common bonds and the film craft", the spokesman said.
Pitching is a great way to meet film professionals, take several job interviews at once, and get a job.
The festival is linked to the creation of the Private Higher Vocational School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, the husband and wife Vladan and Milán Terč, organized the first edition in 1997.
It was held every two years until sixth grade.
In the event of the bankruptcy of CK, insurance companies are required to cover the claims of the clients in full.
Insurance companies should cover the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
The House decided on Wednesday to approve a revised amendment to the tourism business conditions law.
Travel agents will be able to substitute bank guarantee for bankruptcy insurance under a bill that is going to the Senate for consideration.
The insurance companies do not agree to the obligation to cover the claims of the clients even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development is insisting on the amendment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agents against bankruptcy if the ransom is paid.
But the travel agencies are also criticizing the proposal.
Without insurance, they'll either have to quit or go abroad.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is based on the principle that the protection of personal data is guaranteed by the right to privacy.
She pointed to this year's ruling by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will be given sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, she stressed.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must be limited to be feasible", said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
He said the bank guarantee wouldn't work because no one would give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to cease their activities or move abroad", Kalousek warned.
The Czech authorities have not provided any evidence to support the claim that the Commission has not taken into account the alleged infringement of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of the insurance companies", he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, as no official written statement of the insurance companies to this effect exists.
But they're trying to figure out if the travel agencies are gonna be involved, which Okamura says is not a problem.
The establishment was also warned by Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Czech Travel Agents, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs by Czech travel agencies.
Fischer says travel agents won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection is working", Fischer says.
Her motion to remove the disputed passage was rejected by the House.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Filip pointed out that travel agencies could be a danger to consumers.
The rapporteur, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would have limited the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance would not cover the full risk, in view of the Constitutional Court's ruling.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agents offering air travel and a million limit for travel agents selling, for example, bus travel.
The limit will remain at 30 per cent of the planned turnover from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of the insurance performance will have to be such that in the event of the bankruptcy of the tour operator, it covers all the claims of the customers.
The standard, as amended, provides that travel agencies will have to re-indicate which tour operator is organising the tours for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies with, inter alia, information on the management and number of trips before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment is also expected to be submitted to the insurance companies on a regular basis.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the airport services agreement with the airport services agreement.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil one of its legal obligations towards the insurance undertaking, it shall, in accordance with the draft amending act, call it to order or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts where the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of the customers.
The amendment also aims to adjust the financing of the mining service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mining service on the basis of its application, which it will submit each year by the end of April for the following year.
The request shall contain a report on the use of public money in the previous year, a financial plan of expenditure and a prospectus for the next two years.
According to the association, the drafting of the law did not envisage the situation that would arise if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
She won't be allowed to run the tours, and clients who bought the tours before the insurance was canceled, according to the association, will lose it.
In such a case, the CK would suffer a significant loss and could even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One way that travel agencies can deal with such a situation is to sue the State for damages.
Another option would be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad and then act only as agencies in our market, said the association's vice-president Jan Papež.
The draft amendment, he said, also includes a bank guarantee institute, but so recklessly that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since a bank guarantee cannot amount to an unlimited amount.
In addition, the association considers that the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the next two years, the new EU directive will require a re-work of the whole law.
A total of 942 active insured travel agents are currently operating on the Czech market.
Only three CPs have ceased operations this year.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about CZK 20 billion a year.
We must improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the flow of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting with the German prime ministers.
She also reiterated her call for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 Member States.
We need to do more to help countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work for decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, who said that such a signal could include more financial aid or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The Commonwealth countries also support the German government in pushing for a fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis among European countries", Merkel said.
The regional prime minister of Brno, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The Czech Republic, among others, has long rejected the allocation of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also called for speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start the integration of foreigners faster, said the Prime Minister of Brno.
He also said that most of the money Germany spends on refugee care should be used for the integration of those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
We'll need more teachers to help the refugees master German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we can integrate the refugees, they can be a boon to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight, the cast member interrupted Brown when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives on the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it with the cast of the movie, not the cast of the show", Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted with indignation and distrust, and she sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the Martian comments went on the air.
Damon and Brown have teamed up with co-starring producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony", Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker being picked on by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People sued finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon ruled that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in dissent over Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the video, writing, "Matt Damon jumped into the conversation of the only black woman in the room so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts".
The tweet has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national momentum, pressuring lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made references to the movement while announcing the nominees for Album of the Year during the Grammy Awards.
"Algae are still important", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest Black Lives Matter leader released a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a charity group", the leaders declared.
Damon was recently named to the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to the Pope's visit to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior has the first winner
Professional mountaineer and pickup artist Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior contest on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which has just concluded its seventh season, none of the competitors have managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the season finale this year, two men fought their way to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The final obstacle was a 30-second climb over a rope more than 220 metres long.
Britten completed the climb first and within the set limit, becoming the first competitor to overcome the strenuous 4 sections of the American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero overtook him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News shortly after his hard-fought victory, and it was revealed that he was still in shock from winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life", Isaac E! said in response to his win.
So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now.
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the run of the finals and why Britten won't win any awards despite becoming the first contestant to finish the course.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest finisher.
"If there are more competitors on the track, the winner is the one with the best time", said Weed.
Even if winning the grand prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
I don't think he'd hold a grudge.
He's glad he's been able to accomplish what he's done.
He got a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He's a hero to his wife and children.
Geoff said to me, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed the Minnesota Twins .
The second half of the season hasn't been a walk in the park for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are currently in last place in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers just narrowly reversed their defeat when they beat Minnesota in a 5-4 tie Tuesday night at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get close to the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Even if it was just for one night, for Detroit, it was a return to the Z word that was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun, no matter what the way", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive lead, and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then grabbed another in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) allowed 6 1/3 innings and three walks.
It was only his third straight game in the last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with a convincing result", Simon said.
It's hard to get into a game when you're on the bench a lot, so I want to get into the game.
Tiger Victor Martinez hit three home runs and drove in two runs and his first stolen base since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since his last game in June, when he hit four home runs against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned in", said Ausmus.
He looked good in practice, he fired noticeably better, and he was able to bring that into the game.
With three laps to go in the bottom of the seventh, the Twins have the best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the game with two points on the left side of the field.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored on a set-up and Simon sent off Brian Dozier before being replaced by left fielder Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Maurer, and had ahead of him the batting man Miguel San, who shot the ball and went two-thirds ahead, leaving behind right-hander Drew Verhaagen.
With two players on goal and a chance for a draw in the second half, VerHagen managed to send a third-meter through two yards.
Plouffe has already taken 27 laps over two laps this season and is leading the league table.
Detroit held on to the ninth, Mauer scored two runs, and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 lead for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked San out for three runs.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers have won three innings in the first two innings against a retired right-hander who came into the game after more than a month off due to a back injury.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start", said Hughes, "but by the third shift I felt I was throwing better".
After resisting the first-inning attack, Hughes gave up one point to second-meter Ian Kinsler.
Two outs for right-hander J.D. Martinez, who brought Victor Martinez first to go around the meters.
Victor Martinez has broken his own series 0-21.
Third-meter Nick Castellanos followed with a point to the right of the field and scored the next lap, but Victor Martinez was passed over when he tried to make it to third.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and catcher Anthony Gose scored two and one points, and the score was 3-0.
"It got us down on our knees", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place.
Hughes, who won by a tally of runs, finished the third inning without a point and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three yards, got six kicks and four strikeouts.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' starting right fielder, ended the game with pain in his right shoulder.
He'll be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on injured reserve with a strained shoulder since mid-August, is scheduled to start Wednesday's game.
Sanchez replaces left-hander Daniel Norris, who returns from injury to play against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded to left-handed pitcher David Price, he's 1-1 in four games.
But he hasn't played since August 20th because of a strained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is facing off against Minnesota left-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the management reform task force on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies", he said of the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group on Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
The promotion of opening-up in the emerging reforms will add new momentum and vitality, and will also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on regulatory market access, the liberalisation of border controls, the encouragement of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the resident registration system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment threshold.
This system will be tested and improved through test programmes.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
The government will also ease controls on the powers it delegates to firms, and ensure that firms themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also states that China will enable the border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and provide them with better services", the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a 'green card', by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers to practise and to develop professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and the Heads of State Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new bed unit may be created.
According to the Deputy Headman of Karlovy Vary region, Jakub Panik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, a one-day surgery centre could be set up in a surgical department, where surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed according to the concept.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals the one-day surgery workplace should be.
A laser centre could be set up in the skin department of Karlovy Vary Hospital, with the possibility of applying laser technology to skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to care for patients with brain damage who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anaesthesia and resuscitation unit.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region is the aftercare beds, in particular the Long-Term Care (LDN) bed, which is insufficient in Nejdek and should closely follow the acute care beds.
Part of the facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a conventional LDN bed, the concept suggests.
He points out that the aftercare beds are missing mainly at Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There's a lot of abandoned buildings that could be used after the re-location.
Last but not least, there are no social health beds in the Karlovy Vary region, which focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the republic, so it could serve other regions as a so-called Alzheimer's center.
The recommendation also calls for hospitals to prepare for the introduction of so-called 'spare beds' to which European grants will be made available.
"These beds will follow up on the super-specialized care areas and will provide a space for patients to be transferred after surgery, for example after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedures", the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
