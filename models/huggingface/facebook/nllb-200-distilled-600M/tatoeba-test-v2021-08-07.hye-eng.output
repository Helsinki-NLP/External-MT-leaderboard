Women are changing the world.
What a waste.
Will someone finally help or not?
The wood is burning.
The wood is swimming.
Slow down.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Write to me.
Years have passed.
I did.
You can't do it without me.
You can't do it without me.
You better pull back.
You'd better back off.
You'd better get home as soon as possible.
You do nothing but eat.
You have to sign this.
You have to sign this.
You have the right to your opinion.
You're not getting this right.
You are so passionate.
You are so passionate.
You are a polyglot.
You are the leader.
You are running.
You're running.
I'm in love with Mary.
You tried.
You did an experiment.
You were supposed to wait.
You were supposed to wait.
